### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Agent is a multi-agent framework for dynamic optimization in multi-label image classification, outperforming conventional methods with superior accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static training configurations struggle in dynamic multi-label image classification tasks, necessitating adaptive solutions.

Method: MAT-Agent uses autonomous agents with non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to dynamically optimize training elements like data augmentation and learning rates, enhanced with smoothing and mixed-precision training.

Result: Achieves higher mAP, OF1, and CF1 scores on Pascal VOC, COCO, and VG-256 datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MAT-Agent provides scalable, adaptive optimization for visual models, advancing deep learning adaptability.

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO is a dual-objective framework optimizing data importance and diversity for efficient MLLM training, achieving near-full-data performance with 20% data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of training MLLMs on large datasets necessitate efficient data selection methods that combine importance and diversity optimally.

Method: CoIDO uses a lightweight plug-in scorer trained on a small random sample to jointly optimize importance and diversity, reducing computational overhead.

Result: CoIDO-selected 20% subset achieved 98.2% performance of full-data fine-tuning on LLaVA-1.5-7B across ten tasks.

Conclusion: CoIDO offers a scalable and efficient solution for data selection in MLLMs, maintaining high performance with minimal data.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

### [3] [Pre to Post-Treatment Glioblastoma MRI Prediction using a Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17851)
*Alexandre G. Leclercq,Sébastien Bougleux,Noémie N. Moreau,Alexis Desmonts,Romain Hérault,Aurélien Corroyer-Dulmont*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Latent Diffusion Model for early visual Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) in Glioblastoma (GBM) patients, generating post-treatment MRI from pre-treatment MRI to predict tumor evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GBM has heterogeneous therapeutic responses; early prediction is crucial for personalized medicine. Current TRP methods rely on timeseries data, but the paper focuses on slice-to-slice translation for quicker insights.

Method: A Latent Diffusion Model uses concatenation-based conditioning from pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization, enhanced by classifier-free guidance using survival data.

Result: Trained and tested on a dataset of 140 GBM patients, the model aims to predict post-treatment tumor evolution.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a novel approach for early TRP in GBM, potentially improving personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

### [4] [Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854)
*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using image embeddings and vector similarity to detect AI-generated images by analyzing proximity in embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic AI-generated images challenges content authentication, necessitating methods to verify integrity and origin.

Method: Utilizes five benchmark embedding models to process diverse datasets of AI and human-generated images, analyzing embedding proximity.

Result: Experiments confirm robustness, showing perturbations minimally affect embedding signatures, maintaining similarity to originals.

Conclusion: The framework offers an accurate and efficient solution for detecting AI-generated images, generalizable across contexts.

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### [5] [CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17855)
*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of recognizing backchannel behaviors in conversations by proposing CMIS-Net, a multi-scale network that normalizes individual differences and improves generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backchannel behaviors are crucial for human-like AI but are complicated by individual differences across multiple scales.

Method: CMIS-Net normalizes individual backchannel features at frame and sequence levels and includes implicit data augmentation.

Result: CMIS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in backchannel agreement detection.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles individual differences and data imbalance in backchannel recognition.

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

### [6] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ultra-efficient post-training method enhances large-scale pre-trained diffusion models into few-step samplers using velocity field self-distillation, eliminating the need for retraining or step-size embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient few-step sampling in pre-trained flow matching models without costly retraining or specialized modifications.

Method: Leverages novel velocity field self-distillation to impart aggressive shortcutting, avoiding step-size embedding and enabling efficient training.

Result: Achieves efficient training (e.g., 3-step Flux model in less than one A100 day) and state-of-the-art performance with minimal resources.

Conclusion: The method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for enhancing diffusion models, even enabling few-shot distillation for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

### [7] [Robotic Classification of Divers' Swimming States using Visual Pose Keypoints as IMUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17863)
*Demetrious T. Kutzke,Ying-Kun Wu,Elizabeth Terveen,Junaed Sattar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid method combining computer vision and pseudo-IMU data to monitor scuba diver safety underwater, overcoming limitations of traditional IMUs and wireless signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human activity recognition methods fail underwater due to signal attenuation and environmental challenges, prompting the need for a novel approach to enhance diver safety.

Method: The approach uses computer vision to generate motion data (pseudo-IMU) from 3D human joint keypoints, avoiding wireless signal issues. It integrates onboard an AUV to classify diver distress behaviors.

Result: Experiments with simulated distress scenarios confirm the method's effectiveness in detecting anomalies like cardiac arrest, improving diver monitoring.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully bridges gaps in underwater activity recognition, offering a robust solution for diver safety and robotic monitoring.

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InsideOut extends 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) by integrating RGB and X-ray data, improving visualization and non-destructive testing in medical, cultural heritage, and manufacturing fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is critical for applications like medical diagnostics and cultural heritage restoration, but existing methods struggle with disparate data representations and limited paired datasets.

Method: InsideOut collects paired RGB and X-ray data, uses hierarchical fitting to align radiative Gaussian splats, and introduces an X-ray reference loss for consistent internal structures.

Result: The approach effectively bridges RGB surface details with subsurface X-ray structures, enhancing the utility of 3DGS in multiple domains.

Conclusion: InsideOut successfully extends 3DGS applicability, providing improved visualization, simulation, and non-destructive testing capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

### [9] [MUSE: Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity Estimation for zero-shot 2D Object Detection and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17866)
*Sungmin Cho,Sungbum Park,Insoo Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE is a training-free framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation. Using multi-view templates and embeddings, it achieves top performance on BOP Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a generalized, training-free solution for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation that performs robustly under challenging conditions.

Method: MUSE integrates class and patch embeddings, uses GeM pooling for normalization, and employs a joint similarity metric with uncertainty-aware refinement.

Result: MUSE ranks first in BOP Challenge 2025 across multiple tracks without additional training.

Conclusion: MUSE proves to be a powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot tasks in 2D object detection and segmentation.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

### [10] [GAN-based Content-Conditioned Generation of Handwritten Musical Symbols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17869)
*Gerard Asbert,Pau Torras,Lei Kang,Alicia Fornés,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of real annotated data in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) by using a GAN to generate realistic synthetic handwritten musical scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of real annotated data in OMR, especially for historical scores, motivates the exploration of synthetic data generation to improve recognition models.

Method: A music symbol-level GAN is implemented, and its outputs are assembled into full scores using Smashcima engraving software.

Result: Generated symbols show high visual realism, indicating significant progress in synthetic score generation.

Conclusion: Synthetic scores generated by the GAN are realistic and can potentially enhance OMR training.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

### [11] [Auditing and Mitigating Bias in Gender Classification Algorithms: A Data-Centric Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17873)
*Tadesse K Bahiru,Natnael Tilahun Sinshaw,Teshager Hailemariam Moges,Dheeraj Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights biases in gender classification datasets, audits five datasets, and proposes BalancedFace, a new dataset engineered for fairness, reducing racial and gender biases significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inherited and amplified demographic imbalances in gender classification datasets, leading to biased models.

Method: The method involves auditing datasets, training classifiers on balanced datasets (UTKFace and FairFace), and constructing BalancedFace to address intersectional underrepresentation.

Result: Training a classifier on BalancedFace reduces bias, cutting the True Positive Rate gap by 50% and improving Disparate Impact scores by 63%, with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Data-centric interventions like BalancedFace are valuable for fair gender classification, proving effectiveness in reducing bias.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

### [12] [3D Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Class-Aware and Geometry-Guided Pseudo-Label Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17875)
*Xiaoxu Xu,Xuexun Liu,Jinlong Li,Yitian Yuan,Qiudan Zhang,Lin Ma,Nicu Sebe,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method integrates geometric priors and a class-aware guidance mechanism to improve pseudo-label quality and coverage, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of low-quality pseudo-labels and insufficient use of 3D geometric priors in existing 3D WSSS methods.

Method: Combines Class-Aware Label Refinement and Geometry-Aware Label Refinement modules, along with a Self-Training-based Label Update strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks with strong generalization in unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances pseudo-label quality and coverage, leading to superior 3D WSSS performance.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

*Ghazal Danaee,Marc Niethammer,Jarrett Rushmore,Sylvain Bouix*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates segmentation models for MRI-based NAc delineation, focusing on fairness disparities linked to race and sex. It finds race-matched training improves accuracy for some models, while sex effects persist in biased models, unlike race effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in deep-learning-based medical image segmentation, particularly disparities linked to race and sex in MRI analyses.

Method: Evaluated three segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net, CoTr) and atlas-based ANTs on NAc segmentation using race- and sex-stratified data. Analyzed performance and volume effects with fairness metrics and linear mixed models.

Result: Race-matched training boosts accuracy for ANTs and UNesT; nnU-Net performs robustly regardless. Sex effects persist in biased models, while race effects largely disappear.

Conclusion: Fairness in segmentation depends on model choice and training data demographics, with implications for reducing bias in medical AI applications.

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

TL;DR: ManzaiSet is a multimodal dataset addressing Western bias in affective computing, revealing diverse viewer responses to Japanese comedy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome Western-centric bias in affective computing by studying non-Western comedy viewer responses.

Method: Captured facial videos and audio from 241 participants watching Japanese manzai comedy, analyzed via clustering and automated humor classification.

Result: Identified three viewer types, a positive viewing order effect, and no type-wise humor response differences post-FDR correction.

Conclusion: ManzaiSet enables culturally aware emotion AI and personalized entertainment for non-Western contexts.

Abstract: We present ManzaiSet, the first large scale multimodal dataset of viewer
responses to Japanese manzai comedy, capturing facial videos and audio from 241
participants watching up to 10 professional performances in randomized order
(94.6 percent watched >= 8; analyses focus on n=228). This addresses the
Western centric bias in affective computing. Three key findings emerge: (1) k
means clustering identified three distinct viewer types: High and Stable
Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent,
n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of
variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a
positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001,
permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables
culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,
and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing
by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement
analysis. The source code for this project is available on

*Roberto Brusnicki,David Pop,Yuan Gao,Mattia Piccinini,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAVANT is a structured reasoning framework for detecting anomalous driving scenarios using Vision Language Models (VLMs), outperforming baselines and enabling efficient deployment with open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of autonomous driving systems to rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies.

Method: Uses a two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction and multi-modal evaluation across four semantic layers (Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, Environment).

Result: Achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy, with a fine-tuned open-source model reaching 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy.

Conclusion: SAVANT provides a practical solution for reliable anomaly detection and addresses data scarcity by accurately labeling real-world images.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

*Harshini Suresha,Kavitha SH*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ML models for detecting red palm mite infestation in palm plants, introducing TriggerNet for interpretable AI explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Red palm mite infestations cause significant agricultural losses, necessitating early and accurate detection methods.

Method: Utilized TriggerNet with Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV for explainable AI. Trained models on RGB images of 11 plant species using CNNs and ML classifiers.

Result: Implemented advanced DL models and ML classifiers for plant and disease classification, using Snorkel for efficient labeling.

Conclusion: TriggerNet provides interpretable solutions for mite detection, aiding effective pest management in palm cultivation.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HouseTour generates 3D camera trajectories and natural language summaries from images, improving VLMs with geometric reasoning and 3D Gaussian splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with geometric reasoning; HouseTour aims to automate professional-quality video creation for real estate and tourism.

Method: Uses diffusion for smooth trajectories, integrates poses into VLMs, and renders views via 3D Gaussian splatting, tested on the HouseTour dataset.

Result: Incorporating 3D trajectories improves text generation; a new joint metric evaluates end-to-end performance.

Conclusion: HouseTour enables automated high-quality video creation without specialized expertise.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

*Shivam Singh,Yiming Chen,Agneet Chatterjee,Amit Raj,James Hays,Yezhou Yang,Chitra Baral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chimera is a personalized image generation model combining parts from multiple source images using textual instructions, outperforming baselines in part alignment and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lack control for composing objects from specific parts of multiple images without user-specified masks or annotations.

Method: Chimera uses a dataset of semantic atoms (464 unique pairs), trains a diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance, and introduces PartEval for evaluation.

Result: Chimera improves part alignment and compositional accuracy by 14% and visual quality by 21% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Chimera effectively combines parts from multiple images, enhancing personalized image generation without manual annotations.

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

*Paul-Tiberiu Miclea,Martin Sboron,Hardik Vaghasiya,Hoang Thinh Nguyen,Meet Gadara,Thomas Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using SEM imaging and machine learning (YOLO models) for detecting microplastics, highlighting challenges like manual analysis inefficiency and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastics are hard to detect manually; ML can improve efficiency and accuracy in large-scale studies.

Method: Combines SEM imaging with ML object detection (YOLO models) for microplastic detection in filtration scenarios.

Result: Shows variations in YOLO model performance and emphasizes preprocessing optimization; notes limited labeled data as a challenge.

Conclusion: ML enhances microplastic detection, but further work is needed to address data limitations and preprocessing.

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

*Rohan Choudhury,JungEun Kim,Jinhyung Park,Eunho Yang,László A. Jeni,Kris M. Kitani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT improves Vision Transformers by adaptively varying patch sizes in images, reducing token count and boosting speed without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs use fixed patch sizes, leading to inefficient long sequences for high-res images. APT aims to optimize this.

Method: APT dynamically adjusts patch sizes—larger patches for simple areas, smaller ones for complex regions.

Result: APT speeds up ViTs by 40-50%, maintains performance, and reduces training/inference time by up to 30%.

Conclusion: APT efficiently enhances ViTs by optimizing patch allocation, enabling faster processing with no performance loss.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for 3D reconstruction, highlighting its strengths and limitations, and surveys its applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of 3DGS, such as high memory usage and limited support for secondary-ray effects, while leveraging its efficient rendering capabilities for novel applications.

Method: The tutorial explores the 3DGS pipeline, starting with its splatting formulation, and examines efforts to overcome its drawbacks.

Result: A comprehensive overview of 3DGS advancements, its limitations, and potential improvements.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers promising real-time rendering capabilities but requires further development to address its current shortcomings, with broad applications in surface reconstruction and content generation.

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

*Zhiqi Kang,Rahaf Aljundi,Vaggelis Dorovatas,Karteek Alahari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an online In-Context Distillation (ICD) method to adapt small vision-language models (VLMs) for low-resource settings by leveraging sparse demonstrations from a stronger teacher model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs are impractical for low-resource settings, while small VLMs require costly fine-tuning. The goal is to bridge this gap efficiently.

Method: ICD involves small VLMs collaborating with teacher models at inference time, using cross-modal demonstration selection, teacher test-time scaling, and student uncertainty conditioning.

Result: ICD boosts small model performance by up to 33% with minimal teacher annotations (as low as 4%) and matches teacher zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: ICD effectively adapts small VLMs for budget-constrained settings, outperforming fine-tuning under compute constraints.

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

TL;DR: The paper explores safety and security challenges in natural-language-based collaborative driving, introduces SafeCoop for defense, and demonstrates its effectiveness in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X systems face high bandwidth demands and semantic loss, while natural language offers semantic richness but introduces new vulnerabilities like message loss and adversarial attacks.

Method: Develops SafeCoop, an agentic defense pipeline with a semantic firewall, consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, tested in CARLA simulations.

Result: SafeCoop improves driving scores by 69.15% under attacks and achieves up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection.

Conclusion: The study advances research on secure language-driven collaboration in transportation, highlighting SafeCoop's effectiveness.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy
language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World-in-World is introduced as an open platform to benchmark generative world models (WMs) for embodied agent decision-making, prioritizing task success over visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for WMs focus on visual quality but fail to address their utility in embodied tasks.

Method: The study introduces World-in-World, a closed-loop platform with unified planning and action APIs, and evaluates four environments.

Result: Key findings include the importance of controllability over visual quality, effectiveness of post-training scaling, and benefits of inference-time compute.

Conclusion: Embodied utility of WMs depends on controllability and scalable training, not just visual realism.

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

TL;DR: LunarStereo introduces a photorealistic stereo image dataset for lunar 3D reconstruction, enabling improved accuracy over existing methods through fine-tuning the MASt3R model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stereo vision methods fail on lunar surfaces due to lack of texture, lighting variations, and atypical trajectories, necessitating domain-specific solutions.

Method: Simulates stereo image pairs using ray tracing based on lunar topography/reflectance models, fine-tunes MASt3R on LunarStereo dataset.

Result: Significant improvements in 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, validated on synthetic and real lunar data.

Conclusion: LunarStereo and adapted MASt3R enhance lunar 3D reconstruction, supporting robust generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in detecting anomalies due to occlusions and dynamic motion patterns in crowded scenes, along with the lack of interpretable indicators in existing methods.

Method: Uses head detection and dense optical flow to extract person-specific velocities, categorizes them via hierarchical clustering, and employs a percentile-based anomaly scoring system.

Result: Effective real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns in densely crowded environments.

Conclusion: VelocityNet addresses limitations of existing approaches by providing interpretable anomaly indicators and adapting to varying crowd densities.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

TL;DR: Current medical vision-language models struggle with simultaneous diagnostic text and segmentation mask generation. The paper introduces RadDiagSeg-D dataset and RadDiagSeg-M model to address this gap, achieving strong performance in multi-target text-and-mask generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack the ability to generate both diagnostic text and segmentation masks simultaneously, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: Introduced RadDiagSeg-D dataset for unified hierarchical tasks and developed RadDiagSeg-M model for joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and segmentation.

Result: RadDiagSeg-M demonstrated strong performance in multi-target text-and-mask generation, setting a competitive baseline.

Conclusion: RadDiagSeg-M effectively addresses the need for enriched contextual information in assistive diagnosis, showcasing robust performance.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

*Maryam Dialameh,Hossein Rajabzadeh,Jung Suk Sim,Hyock Ju Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMA-SAM improves SAM-2 for stable tumor tracking in ultrasound videos with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lesion segmentation in PTMC ultrasound videos is challenging due to low contrast and artifacts. SAM-2 suffers from instability in dynamic settings.

Method: EMA-SAM enhances SAM-2 with a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer for temporal coherence.

Result: EMA-SAM boosts maxDice to 0.86, maxIoU to 0.76, reduces false positives by 29%, and achieves real-time performance (~30 FPS).

Conclusion: EMA-SAM is a robust, efficient solution for interventional ultrasound, bridging foundation models and clinical demands.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLSU, a framework for evaluating multimodal safety, revealing gaps in joint image-text understanding and alignment in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluations miss risks from joint interpretation of multimodal content and fail to distinguish clearly unsafe from borderline cases, leading to problematic outcomes like over-blocking or under-refusal.

Method: VLSU uses fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 safety patterns, employing a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation to build a benchmark of 8,187 samples.

Result: Models perform well on unimodal signals (90%+ accuracy) but degrade significantly (20-55%) when joint reasoning is needed. A critical 34% of errors occur despite correct unimodal classification.

Conclusion: VLSU exposes weaknesses in joint reasoning and alignment, providing a test bed for improving robust vision-language safety.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

### [31] [Beyond Frequency: Scoring-Driven Debiasing for Object Detection via Blueprint-Prompted Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18229)
*Xinhao Cai,Liulei Li,Gensheng Pei,Tao Chen,Jinshan Pan,Yazhou Yao,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generation-based debiasing framework for object detection, addressing limitations of prior methods by using a representation score (RS) and visual blueprints for high-quality synthesis, significantly improving performance for underrepresented objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior debiasing methods are limited by sample diversity, and naive generative augmentation often preserves biases. The paper identifies issues with instance frequency as a proxy for data needs and the fidelity of layout-to-image synthesis.

Method: The framework uses a representation score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps and creates unbiased layouts. It replaces text prompts with visual blueprints and employs generative alignment for high-quality synthesis.

Result: The method improves performance for underrepresented objects, with gains of 4.4/3.6 mAP for large/rare instances and surpasses prior L2I models by 15.9 mAP for layout accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses debiasing challenges in object detection by leveraging RS and precise visual synthesis, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

*Haoran Wei,Yaofeng Sun,Yukun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR explores compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping, achieving high OCR precision with efficient vision token usage, outperforming benchmarks and enabling large-scale data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate efficient compression of long contexts using optical 2D mapping, addressing challenges in historical long-context compression and LLM memory forgetting mechanisms.

Method: DeepSeek-OCR uses DeepEncoder for low-activation, high-compression vision tokens and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder, tested under varying compression ratios (10x and 20x).

Result: Achieves 97% OCR precision at <10x compression and 60% at 20x, outperforming benchmarks (GOT-OCR2.0 and MinerU2.0) with fewer tokens, and generates 200k+ pages/day on an A100-40G.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR shows promise for long-context compression and practical applications, offering high performance and scalability.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at

### [33] [BlendCLIP: Bridging Synthetic and Real Domains for Zero-Shot 3D Object Classification with Multimodal Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18244)
*Ajinkya Khoche,Gergő László Nagy,Maciej Wozniak,Thomas Gustafsson,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlendCLIP is a multimodal pretraining framework that combines synthetic and real-world data to improve zero-shot 3D object classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high label efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The domain gap between synthetic training data and real-world LiDAR scans hinders zero-shot 3D object classification. Current methods trained on either synthetic or real data alone fail to generalize or lack semantic diversity.

Method: BlendCLIP introduces a curriculum-based data mixing strategy, generating a dataset of point clouds, images, and text descriptions from real-world driving data. It grounds the model in synthetic CAD data before adapting it to real-world scans.

Result: The method boosts zero-shot accuracy by 27% with minimal real-world samples and achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving prior methods by 19.3%.

Conclusion: Effective domain adaptation, not full-scale real-world annotation, is key to robust open-vocabulary 3D perception.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenInsGaussian introduces a novel open-vocabulary instance segmentation framework for 3D scenes, addressing limitations in existing methods with context-aware feature extraction and attention-driven fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding 3D scenes is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics, but current semantic Gaussian Splatting methods lack sufficient contextual cues and suffer from inconsistencies in multi-view feature fusion.

Method: The proposed framework includes Context-Aware Feature Extraction for richer semantic context and Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation to selectively fuse multi-view features, reducing errors and incompleteness.

Result: OpenInsGaussian outperforms existing baselines significantly in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, demonstrating robustness and generality.

Conclusion: The approach marks a significant advancement in 3D scene understanding, offering practical benefits for real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D
scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world
scenarios.

### [35] [Hyperbolic Space Learning Method Leveraging Temporal Motion Priors for Human Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18256)
*Xiang Zhang,Suping Wu,Weibin Qiu,Zhaocheng Jin,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hyperbolic space learning method for 3D human mesh recovery from videos, leveraging temporal motion priors to capture hierarchical structures accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean-based methods struggle to capture the natural hierarchical structure of human meshes, leading to reconstruction errors.

Method: The approach includes a temporal motion prior extraction module and a hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy, enhanced by a proposed hyperbolic mesh optimization loss.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space learning effectively improves 3D human mesh recovery by leveraging hierarchical relationships and temporal motion priors.

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UWBench, a benchmark for underwater vision-language understanding, featuring 15,003 annotated images and three comprehensive tasks to evaluate VLMs in challenging underwater conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large vision-language models excel in natural scenes but lack exploration in underwater environments, which pose unique challenges like light attenuation and color distortion. Specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems is also required.

Method: UWBench is created with 15,003 high-resolution underwater images annotated with referring expressions and QA pairs. Three benchmarks are established: image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering.

Result: Experiments show current VLMs struggle with underwater understanding, indicating significant room for improvement. The benchmark serves as a realistic testbed for advancing underwater vision-language research.

Conclusion: UWBench provides crucial resources for marine science and autonomous underwater exploration, highlighting the need for further development in underwater vision-language models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.
Our code and benchmark will be available.

*Xiang Zhang,Suping Wu,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage network improves 3D human mesh recovery by leveraging latent information and low-dimensional learning, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully exploit latent information and suffer from high computational costs with attention-based interaction modeling.

Method: A two-stage network extracts hybrid latent features from image components and uses low-dimensional interaction learning for mesh and pose optimization.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public datasets, achieving accurate reconstruction with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limb misalignment and detail issues while optimizing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TreeFedDG, a tree topology framework for federated domain generalization in medical imaging, addressing global drift issues with hierarchical aggregation, style mixing, and personalized fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle privacy protection and data heterogeneity challenges in medical image segmentation by mitigating the Global Drift problem in federated learning.

Method: Proposes TreeFedDG with hierarchical parameter aggregation, FedStyle for parameter-based style mixing, progressive personalized fusion, and feature-similarity-guided ensemble decision-making.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods on two public datasets, achieving balanced cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: TreeFedDG effectively addresses FedDG-GD, enhancing model generalization and robustness in medical imaging.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingTOM is a two-stage framework tackling efficiency bottlenecks in streaming video vision-language models by reducing pre-LLM prefill cost and compressing kv-cache, achieving significant speed and memory improvements without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches neglect costly pre-LLM prefill bottlenecks in streaming video models, which face constraints like causality and unbounded token growth.

Method: StreamingTOM uses Causal Temporal Reduction to limit per-frame prefill cost and Online Quantized Memory to compress kv-cache in 4-bit format, ensuring bounded growth.

Result: Achieves 15.7× kv-cache compression, 1.2× lower peak memory, 2× faster TTFT, and maintains SOTA accuracy (63.8% offline, 55.8%/3.7 RVS).

Conclusion: StreamingTOM offers an efficient, plug-and-play solution for streaming video understanding with predictable latency and bounded resource growth.

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DB-MDE models struggle with absolute metric depth estimation due to scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios, which this work aims to resolve.

Method: The approach reframes depth estimation as an inverse problem, using pretrained latent diffusion models (LDMs) conditioned on RGB images and stereo-based geometric constraints.

Result: The framework matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios like translucent and specular surfaces, without retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances DB-MDE models with stereo guidance, achieving accurate metric depth estimation across diverse environments.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

TL;DR: Med-RwR is a Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework that enhances MLLMs' reasoning by integrating external knowledge and visual information, achieving superior performance and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLMs lack external knowledge integration, leading to hallucinations and factual inaccuracies. Current Agentic RAG methods also ignore visual data.

Method: Proposes Med-RwR, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework with tailored rewards for retrieval. Introduces Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) for low-confidence cases.

Result: Significant improvements over baselines on medical benchmarks, with an 8.8% gain on EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), showcasing strong generalizability.

Conclusion: Med-RwR effectively integrates external knowledge and visual data, addressing limitations of existing MLLMs and demonstrating robust performance in unfamiliar domains.

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in handling high-resolution biomedical images and avoid critical information loss.

Method: Investigates the impact of image resolution on MLLM performance, testing native-resolution training, inference resolution alignment, and mixed-resolution training.

Result: Native-resolution training improves performance, misalignment degrades it, and mixed-resolution training mitigates issues while maintaining balance.

Conclusion: Prioritizing native-resolution inference and mixed-resolution datasets optimizes biomedical MLLMs for research and clinical use.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

TL;DR: OmniNWM is a unified panoramic navigation world model addressing state, action, and reward dimensions in autonomous driving, outperforming existing models in video generation, control accuracy, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving world models are limited in state modalities, action control, and reward awareness, prompting the need for a more comprehensive solution.

Method: OmniNWM generates panoramic videos (RGB, semantics, depth, 3D occupancy), uses Plucker ray-maps for precise action control, and defines rule-based dense rewards via 3D occupancy.

Result: OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, with reliable closed-loop evaluation.

Conclusion: OmniNWM successfully integrates state, action, and reward dimensions, offering a robust framework for autonomous driving world models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

Result: ATED outperforms state-of-the-art methods on hallucination benchmarks, reducing errors without compromising fluency or relevance.

Conclusion: Adaptive ensembling like ATED enhances LVLM robustness, offering a promising solution for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

### [45] [Enhancing Few-Shot Classification of Benchmark and Disaster Imagery with ATTBHFA-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18326)
*Gao Yu Lee,Tanmoy Dam,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Daniel Puiu Poenar,Vu Duong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ATTBHFA-Net, a novel Few-Shot Learning method using Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distances for better disaster image classification despite data scarcity and high variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in disaster visual recognition due to limited, diverse data and poor performance of existing Few-Shot Learning methods on disaster imagery.

Method: Introduces ATTBHFA-Net, combining Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distance for robust prototype formation and contrastive loss.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks and disaster datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ATTBHFA-Net effectively improves Few-Shot Learning for disaster imagery, enhancing classification accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a four-stage pipeline for realistic view extrapolation in autonomous driving, winning first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of distorted and inconsistent images produced by current NVS methods for autonomous driving simulation.

Method: A four-stage pipeline involving data-driven initialization, geometric priors via 2D-SDF, generative pseudo ground truth, and an adaptation network.

Result: Achieved a top score of 0.441 on the RealADSim-NVS benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively solves the core challenges of street view extrapolation, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in
autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel
View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

*Yudong Li,Hao Li,Xianxu Hou,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative pre-training model for facial knowledge learning using large-scale web-built data, bypassing intensive manual annotation and improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial pre-training models rely on manually labeled datasets, which are labor-intensive and lack scalability.

Method: The model leverages web-crawled text and images with human faces, employing self-supervised tasks like masked image/language modeling and image-text matching. It also uses image-text matching loss for controllable generation.

Result: The model matches state-of-the-art performance in facial downstream tasks (e.g., attribution classification, expression recognition) and excels in diverse face editing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed generative approach effectively addresses scalability and labor constraints while maintaining high performance in facial tasks and editing applications.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

*Jiayu Zhang,Qilang Ye,Shuo Ye,Xun Lin,Zihan Song,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AV-Master enhances AVQA by dynamically modeling temporal and modality dimensions, introducing adaptive focus sampling and preference-aware strategies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVQA methods lack flexibility in temporal sampling and modality preference awareness, limiting reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios.

Method: Proposes AV-Master with dynamic adaptive focus sampling (temporal) and preference-aware strategy (modality), plus dual-path contrastive loss.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AV-Master effectively addresses redundancy and fragmentation, enhancing cross-modal collaboration and reasoning.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

*Yi-Lun Wu,Bo-Kai Ruan,Chiang Tseng,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-DRO introduces a new preference learning framework for text-to-image diffusion models, avoiding reward models and addressing challenges like non-linear estimation and limited offline data diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve alignment of text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by addressing issues like inaccurate probability estimation and limited diversity in offline datasets.

Method: Diffusion-DRO uses inverse reinforcement learning to frame preference learning as a ranking problem, simplifying training into a denoising formulation and integrating offline and online data.

Result: Diffusion-DRO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generation quality across challenging prompts, as shown by quantitative metrics and user studies.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO effectively captures human preferences and overcomes limitations of prior methods, demonstrating strong performance in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

### [50] [Learning Human-Object Interaction as Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18357)
*Jiajun Hong,Jianan Wei,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupHOI introduces a framework for HOI-DET by modeling interactions from a group perspective, leveraging geometric proximity and semantic similarity, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI-DET methods focus on pairwise relationships, ignoring collective behaviors in real-world scenarios. GroupHOI addresses this gap by modeling group-level interactions.

Method: GroupHOI clusters humans and objects based on spatial features, uses self-attention for contextual cue aggregation, and enhances semantic similarity with transformer-based decoders.

Result: GroupHOI achieves superior performance on HICO-DET, V-COCO, and NVI-DET benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Modeling interactions at the group level with geometric and semantic cues improves HOI-DET performance, as demonstrated by GroupHOI's effectiveness.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

### [51] [Visual Space Optimization for Zero-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00330)
*Xinsheng Wang,Shanmin Pang,Jihua Zhu,Zhongyu Li,Zhiqiang Tian,Yaochen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two strategies—visual prototype-based method and intermediate embedding space optimization—to improve zero-shot learning by refining the visual space structure, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot learning faces challenges due to the discrete distribution of visual features, making embedding semantic descriptions ineffective. Optimizing the visual space is crucial for better performance.

Method: Two strategies are introduced: (1) visual prototype-based method for representing classes with prototypes, and (2) optimizing visual feature structure using a multilayer perceptron framework in an intermediate embedding space.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that optimizing the visual space enhances zero-shot learning, with the prototype-based method achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Optimizing the visual space is beneficial for zero-shot learning, and the proposed prototype-based method outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not
included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

### [52] [FeatureFool: Zero-Query Fooling of Video Models via Feature Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18362)
*Duoxun Tang,Xi Xiao,Guangwu Hu,Kangkang Sun,Xiao Yang,Dongyang Chen,Qing Li,Yongjie Yin,Jiyao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeatureFool is a zero-query black-box attack targeting video classifiers and Video-LLMs by altering feature spaces without iterative queries, achieving over 70% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box attacks require multiple queries, making them impractical for real-world applications, especially for Video-LLMs. There's a need for a stealthy, efficient attack leveraging feature maps.

Method: FeatureFool exploits DNN-extracted feature maps to directly shift the clean-video feature space, avoiding iterative queries.

Result: Achieves >70% attack success rate on traditional video classifiers, bypasses Video-LLM recognition, and produces high-quality adversarial videos (high SSIM, PSNR, Temporal-Inconsistency).

Conclusion: FeatureFool offers an efficient, stealthy attack method for video-domain models, demonstrating high success rates and transferability.

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), a novel method leveraging cross-modal scene semantics to improve image complexity assessment, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICA methods lack the ability to fully capture perceived representations tied to image complexity due to reliance on single-modal features. Cross-modal scene semantics show promise but remain unexplored for ICA.

Method: CM-SSA combines a complexity regression branch with a scene semantic alignment branch, aligning images with text prompts to enrich semantic understanding and improve complexity predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show CM-SSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ICA methods.

Conclusion: CM-SSA effectively integrates cross-modal scene semantics to enhance ICA, aligning predictions better with human perception.

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

*Giorgio Piras,Qi Zhao,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Christian Wressnegger,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2AP, a method to stabilize mask selection in adversarial pruning by minimizing score-space sharpness, enhancing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial pruning methods suffer from unstable mask selection due to sharp local minima in robust loss landscapes.

Method: Proposes Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP), which perturbs importance scores and minimizes robust loss during mask search.

Result: S2AP stabilizes mask selection and improves robustness across various datasets, models, and sparsity levels.

Conclusion: S2AP effectively addresses instability in adversarial pruning, offering a more robust solution.

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel local surface representation method using geometric features derived from MRI scans to effectively diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD), achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AD is linked to cortical atrophy, requiring advanced tools for accurate diagnosis. The study aims to validate a new geometric surface analysis method.

Method: Used T1-weighted MRI scans from ADNI, reconstructed cortical surfaces, derived geometric features (area distortion, conformal factor, Gaussian curvature), computed Shannon entropy, and trained classifiers.

Result: MLP and Logistic Regression classifiers achieved 98.62% accuracy in distinguishing AD patients from controls.

Conclusion: Conformally-derived geometric features are robust for AD diagnosis, highlighting the method's clinical potential.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BFCTN, a Bayesian FCTN method for hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion, addressing limitations of existing tensor decomposition methods by preserving spatial-spectral structures and reducing manual parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods disrupt spatial-spectral structures or require rigid constraints, and recent FCTN methods still disrupt intrinsic structures and need extensive tuning. BFCTN aims to overcome these issues.

Method: BFCTN uses a hierarchical sparse prior within a probabilistic framework to connect factor tensors, modeling spatial-spectral correlations. It employs Variational Bayesian inference and EM for parameter estimation.

Result: BFCTN achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy, robustness against noise/degradation, and practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The BFCTN method effectively preserves intrinsic structures, reduces manual tuning, and improves fusion performance.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

*Zhiwei Hao,Jianyuan Guo,Li Shen,Kai Han,Yehui Tang,Han Hu,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleNet introduces an efficient method for scaling vision transformers by inserting layers with shared weights and minimal parameter increases, outperforming traditional training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost and intensity of training larger vision transformer models from scratch, ScaleNet provides a cost-effective scaling solution.

Method: ScaleNet expands pretrained ViTs by adding layers with shared weights and adjustment parameters via parallel adapter modules, maintaining parameter efficiency.

Result: Experiments show ScaleNet improves accuracy by 7.42% over traditional training and reduces training epochs by two-thirds for a scaled DeiT-Base model.

Conclusion: ScaleNet efficiently scales ViTs with minimal cost, showing promise for broader vision applications beyond image classification.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

*Yuanhe Guo,Linxi Xie,Zhuoran Chen,Kangrui Yu,Ryan Po,Guandao Yang,Gordon Wetztein,Hongyi Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageGem dataset addresses the gap in fine-grained user preference annotations for generative models, enabling better preference alignment and personalized model editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance generative models by understanding fine-grained individual preferences, which lack real-world annotated data.

Method: Collected interaction data from 57K users, trained preference alignment models, tested retrieval and recommendation tasks, and proposed a framework for editing models in latent weight space.

Result: Demonstrated improved preference alignment and introduced a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

Conclusion: ImageGem dataset successfully enables personalized generative models through fine-grained user preference data.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

### [60] [Beyond Single Images: Retrieval Self-Augmented Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18437)
*Ji Du,Xin Wang,Fangwei Hao,Mingyang Yu,Chunyuan Chen,Jiesheng Wu,Bin Wang,Jing Xu,Ping Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE introduces a retrieval-based self-augmentation paradigm for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), leveraging dataset-level context without annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods rely heavily on image-level modeling or annotations, missing valuable dataset-level context.

Method: RISE uses prototype libraries and KNN retrieval to generate pseudo-labels, enhanced by Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) and Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR).

Result: RISE outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods.

Conclusion: RISE effectively addresses COD challenges by leveraging dataset-level information and robust retrieval techniques.

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new latent diffusion model generates high-quality 3D chest CT scans from 3D anatomical masks, reducing computational costs while allowing precise control over features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cost-effective method for generating accurate 3D chest CT scans with controlled anatomical features, useful for AI training and healthcare.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion model conditioned on 3D masks (lung and nodule regions) to synthesize 256x256x256 volumetric images at 1 mm resolution on a mid-range GPU.

Result: Demonstrates that relying solely on nodule masks produces incorrect outputs, emphasizing the need for global lung structure in accurate synthesis.

Conclusion: The model successfully generates diverse CT volumes with controlled features, offering a practical tool for medical AI and training.

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D
chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes
volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

*Tianci Bi,Xiaoyi Zhang,Yan Lu,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VFM-VAE to replace distillation-based methods for integrating Vision Foundation Models into LDMs, addressing semantic deviation issues under distribution shifts. It introduces novel decoder designs and a joint alignment strategy, achieving faster convergence and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods weaken VFM alignment robustness under distribution shifts. The paper aims to directly integrate VFMs without distillation flaws.

Method: Introduces VFM-VAE with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks. Uses SE-CKNNA metric for representation analysis and joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment.

Result: Achieves gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in 80 epochs (10x speedup) and 1.62 after 640 epochs, demonstrating superior efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: Direct VFM integration via VFM-VAE is a better paradigm for LDMs, offering robust alignment and high-quality reconstruction.

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

TL;DR: Mono4DGS-HDR is the first system for reconstructing 4D HDR scenes from monocular LDR videos using Gaussian Splatting, achieving superior quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The system addresses the challenge of reconstructing renderable 4D HDR scenes from unposed monocular LDR videos with alternating exposures, a problem previously unstudied.

Method: A two-stage optimization framework based on Gaussian Splatting: first, learning HDR Gaussians in orthographic space; second, refining them in world space with poses and temporal luminance regularization.

Result: Mono4DGS-HDR outperforms adapted state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and speed, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully tackles the novel problem of 4D HDR reconstruction from monocular LDR videos, demonstrating significant advancements.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

TL;DR: A pipeline combining VLMs and RAG enables zero-shot vehicle recognition by leveraging descriptive attributes and textual reasoning, outperforming CLIP by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with newly released vehicle models, and CLIP's fixed weights limit adaptability without costly finetuning.

Method: VLMs convert images to attributes; RAG retrieves and combines textual features with descriptions for LM-based inference.

Result: The method improves recognition by nearly 20% over CLIP, showcasing scalability for smart-city VMMR.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs and RAG offers a scalable, updatable solution for zero-shot vehicle recognition.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWaste is a computer vision platform for real-time waste sorting on smartphones and edge devices, balancing accuracy and efficiency using lightweight models and quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the waste management crisis caused by convenience packaging by enabling efficient waste sorting with AI.

Method: Developed DWaste platform, benchmarked image classification and object detection models, and optimized with quantization.

Result: EfficientNetV2S achieved high accuracy (96%) but high latency, while lightweight models (YOLOv8n/YOLOv11n) offered fast inference (0.03s) and small size (<7MB).

Conclusion: Lightweight models and quantization enable sustainable, real-time waste sorting on edge devices, supporting 'Greener AI'.

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

*Junwen Huang,Shishir Reddy Vutukur,Peter KT Yu,Nassir Navab,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reformulates template-based object pose estimation as a ray alignment problem, using a diffusion transformer architecture for accurate pose inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Failure to retrieve the correct template in traditional methods often leads to inaccurate pose predictions. The paper aims to improve accuracy by leveraging geometric priors and a novel formulation.

Method: The approach reformulates pose estimation as a ray alignment problem, uses a diffusion transformer architecture, and employs a coarse-to-fine training strategy with narrowed template sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods in unseen object pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves pose estimation accuracy by integrating geometric priors and advanced architecture design.

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GBlobs, a local point cloud feature descriptor, to overcome the 'geometric shortcut' issue in 3D object detection, achieving top performance in RoboSense 2025 Track 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors rely on absolute Cartesian coordinates, causing position bias and poor generalization across varying sensor placements.

Method: The solution employs GBlobs, a local feature descriptor, to replace global features, forcing the network to learn object-centric representations.

Result: The approach significantly improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenge.

Conclusion: GBlobs effectively mitigates the geometric shortcut issue, enhancing robustness and generalization in 3D object detection.

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Occluded nuScenes Dataset to address the lack of controlled, reproducible sensor degradations in existing autonomous driving datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack controlled degradations, limiting systematic evaluation of perception models under adverse conditions.

Method: Extends nuScenes benchmark with parameterised occlusions for cameras, radar, and LiDAR, including new and adapted occlusion types.

Result: Provides flexible, repeatable occlusion generation for multi-sensor data, enabling consistent evaluation.

Conclusion: The dataset advances research on robust sensor fusion and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kaleido is a subject-to-video (S2V) generation framework that improves multi-subject consistency and background handling by introducing a data construction pipeline and Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing S2V models struggle with multi-subject consistency and background disentanglement, leading to low reference fidelity and semantic drift due to limited training data diversity and suboptimal multi-image integration.

Method: Kaleido addresses these issues with a dedicated data construction pipeline (filtering low-quality samples and synthesizing diverse data) and R-RoPE for stable multi-image integration.

Result: Experiments show Kaleido outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization.

Conclusion: Kaleido advances S2V generation by improving multi-subject consistency and handling.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CovMatch is a scalable multimodal dataset distillation framework that improves cross-modal alignment and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending dataset distillation to multimodal contrastive learning faces challenges in cross-modal alignment and computational scalability. Prior methods freeze the text encoder, limiting performance.

Method: CovMatch aligns cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions within each modality, enabling joint optimization of both encoders.

Result: On Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch achieves up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Conclusion: CovMatch effectively addresses scalability and alignment challenges, outperforming existing multimodal distillation methods.

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

TL;DR: 3DThinker is a framework enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language models without explicit 3D input, outperforming baselines and unifying 3D representations in multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with 3D spatial reasoning due to reliance on text or 2D visuals without leveraging inherent 3D geometric information.

Method: Proposes 3DThinker, a framework trained in two stages: aligning 3D latent spaces with a 3D foundation model and optimizing reasoning trajectories using outcome signals.

Result: Outperforms baselines in benchmarks, demonstrating effective 3D mentaling without explicit 3D training data.

Conclusion: 3DThinker advances multimodal reasoning by integrating 3D representations, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

*Baptiste Bauvin,Loïc Baret,Ola Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel one-shot pruning framework using explainable deep learning to reduce model size with minimal performance drop, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the computational expense and performance drop issues in structured pruning for neural networks.

Method: Introduces a causal-aware pruning approach leveraging cause-effect relations for progressive pruning without fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves substantial model size reduction with minimal performance impact on CNN and vision transformer baselines.

Conclusion: The framework offers a superior trade-off compared to existing methods, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: Ǫ-Seg uses hierarchical variational autoencoders with innovative techniques like center-region masking and sparse label contrastive learning to achieve competitive semantic segmentation in EM images, even with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of EM images is challenging due to their complexity and sparse labeling, necessitating robust methods.

Method: Ǫ-Seg employs HVAEs, center-region masking, sparse label CL, a GMM prior, and clustering-free label prediction via MLP.

Result: Competitive segmentation performance on EM and fluorescence microscopy datasets, even with sparse labels (0.05% or less).

Conclusion: Ǫ-Seg effectively addresses sparse-label challenges in biological image segmentation, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interactive satellite image change detection algorithm using active learning, featuring a novel invertible network for data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve satellite image change detection by dynamically updating the model based on user feedback.

Method: Employs an iterative active learning process with a question-and-answer model and a novel invertible network for linear augmentation transformations.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances change detection accuracy through interactive learning and invertible network-based augmentation.

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

*Hanif Rasyidi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines factors affecting deep learning performance in historical writer identification, highlighting challenges like diverse handwriting and limited labeled samples. It compares traditional methods with end-to-end approaches, identifying weaknesses and proposing improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity in handwriting styles, document degradation, and limited labeled samples make historical writer identification (HWI) challenging, even for experts. Traditional methods work well on curated datasets but struggle with automation. The study aims to improve end-to-end deep learning approaches for HWI.

Method: The paper explores various combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and post-processing strategies (text segmentation, patch sampling, feature aggregation). Experiments test models in realistic, zero-shot scenarios.

Result: Most models struggle due to weak low-level feature capture, inconsistent patch representations, and sensitivity to content noise. However, one simpler end-to-end setup matches top-performing systems.

Conclusion: The findings highlight challenges in building robust end-to-end HWI systems and provide insights into effective design choices for improving performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

*Weinan Jia,Yuning Lu,Mengqi Huang,Hualiang Wang,Binyuan Huang,Nan Chen,Mu Liu,Jidong Jiang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), a sparse attention method for efficient long video generation using Diffusion Transformers, overcoming quadratic scaling limitations of full attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers faces inefficiency due to quadratic scaling of full attention. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise estimation, which limits accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Method: MoGA employs a lightweight, learnable token router for precise token matching without blockwise estimation, enabling semantic-aware routing and efficient long-range interactions.

Result: The method produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps with a context length of ~580k, validated by comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: MoGA effectively addresses the bottleneck in long video generation, integrating seamlessly with modern attention stacks and improving efficiency without compromising quality.

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniGenBench++ is introduced as a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I generation, addressing gaps in diversity, multilingual support, and fine-grained evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack diversity, multilingual support, and fine-grained assessment capabilities, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: UniGenBench++ includes 600 prompts organized hierarchically across themes and subthemes, with English and Chinese versions in short and long forms. It uses Gemini-2.5-Pro for benchmark construction and trains a robust evaluation model.

Result: The benchmark systematically evaluates T2I models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.

Conclusion: UniGenBench++ provides a comprehensive, multilingual, and fine-grained solution for assessing semantic consistency in T2I generation.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

*Yiqi Lin,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Linjie Li,Zhengyuan Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VC2L introduces a vision-centric contrastive learning framework using a single vision transformer to handle multimodal web documents, outperforming CLIP-style models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CLIP-style models in handling complex, real-world web documents with loosely aligned or embedded text and images.

Method: VC2L renders all inputs as images, employs snippet-level contrastive learning, and operates entirely in pixel space.

Result: VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance on proposed benchmarks and established datasets.

Conclusion: Multimodal web data is valuable for contrastive learning, and a unified vision-centric approach is scalable.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

*Peiqin Zhuang,Lei Bai,Yichao Wu,Ding Liang,Luping Zhou,Yali Wang,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMIM, a module integrating motion modeling into transformers for improved action recognition, especially on motion-sensitive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based methods excel in scene-related action recognition but lack motion modeling, limiting performance on motion-sensitive datasets.

Method: The EMIM module constructs an affinity matrix akin to cost volume in a sliding-window manner, enhancing both appearance and motion modeling.

Result: EMIM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets, notably on Something-Something V1 & V2.

Conclusion: Integrating motion modeling via EMIM significantly improves transformer-based action recognition, particularly for motion-heavy tasks.

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

*Changkun Liu,Bin Tan,Zeran Ke,Shangzhan Zhang,Jiachen Liu,Ming Qian,Nan Xue,Yujun Shen,Tristan Braud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLANA3R is a pose-free framework for metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes using planar primitives from unposed two-view images. It leverages Vision Transformers and planar splatting for geometry learning without requiring explicit 3D plane annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by utilizing their geometric regularities, avoiding the need for explicit plane supervision.

Method: The framework employs Vision Transformers to extract planar primitives and estimate camera poses. It uses planar splatting to supervise geometry learning via rendered depth and normal maps.

Result: PLANA3R achieves strong generalization across diverse tasks like 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and pose estimation on indoor-scene datasets.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates scalable training on large datasets and accurate plane segmentation, validated by metric supervision.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

*Ling Xing,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Rui Yan,Hongyu Qu,Zechao Li,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeTok proposes vision-centric text interpretation using visual-text rendering and multimodal LLMs, outperforming subword tokenizers with fewer tokens and lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subword tokenization methods fragment text poorly for low-resource languages, leading to inefficiencies and lack of linguistic meaning.

Method: SeeTok renders text as images (visual-text) and uses pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them, leveraging OCR and text-vision alignment.

Result: SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers, using 4.43× fewer tokens, reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, and improving cross-lingual generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: SeeTok shifts toward human-like visual reading, offering a more natural and cognitively inspired approach to language models.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

*Siyong Jian,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel KV cache compression framework reduces memory usage by 5× and speeds up throughput by 6.6× for autoregressive image generation with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models like Janus-Pro face high memory and computational costs due to visual tokens. KV cache compression, well-studied in language modeling, is unexplored for image generation.

Method: Identifies spatial locality and emergent semantic sink phenomena, then compresses KV cache by decoupling attention heads: spatial-locality heads use a recent token window, and semantic-sink heads preserve highly-attended tokens.

Result: Achieves 5× memory reduction and 6.6× throughput speedup with minimal visual quality degradation.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

TL;DR: IF-VidCap benchmarks controllable video captioning, focusing on format and content correctness, revealing top open-source models nearing proprietary performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing instruction-following capabilities in MLLMs for video captioning, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.

Method: Introduces IF-VidCap with 1,400 samples, evaluating models on format and content correctness.

Result: Proprietary models lead, but open-source models are catching up; dense captioning models lag behind general-purpose MLLMs.

Conclusion: Future work should enhance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity in video captioning.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

TL;DR: GAR enhances region-level MLLMs by integrating global contexts and modeling multi-region interactions, achieving superior comprehension and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with fine-grained analysis and global context understanding in dense scenes, prompting the need for improved region-level models.

Method: GAR employs RoI-aligned feature replay to leverage global contexts and model interactions between multiple prompts, enabling advanced compositional reasoning.

Result: GAR-1B outperforms DAM-3B by +4.5 on DLC-Bench and surpasses InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. GAR-8B also excels in video tasks, outperforming VideoRefer-7B.

Conclusion: GAR significantly advances region-level understanding and reasoning, demonstrating strong transferability to diverse tasks like video comprehension.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColIAGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for colonoscopy by addressing illumination variations and improving geometry accuracy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vanilla 3DGS fails to handle photometric variations in colonoscopic scenes due to dynamic lighting, leading to degraded 3D reconstructions.

Method: Proposes ColIAGS with Improved Appearance Modeling (two illumination attenuation factors) and Improved Geometry Modeling (high-dimensional view embedding).

Result: Achieves superior rendering fidelity and reduces Depth MSE, excelling in novel view synthesis and geometric reconstruction.

Conclusion: ColIAGS effectively addresses illumination challenges in colonoscopy, offering improved quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

TL;DR: SEAL introduces a semantic-aware hierarchical learning framework for Generalized Category Discovery, using hierarchical similarity and cross-granularity consistency to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD approaches rely on single-level semantics or manual hierarchies, limiting generalizability and scalability.

Method: SEAL uses hierarchical semantic-guided soft contrastive learning and a cross-granularity consistency module.

Result: SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks like SSB, Oxford-Pet, and Herbarium19, and shows generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively addresses GCD challenges by leveraging hierarchical structures and achieves superior performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

TL;DR: Foundation models trained on global data show promise for predicting urban heat patterns, especially in data-scarce regions, aiding climate-resilient urban planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heat islands worsen with urbanization and climate change, but accurate temperature predictions are lacking, especially in underserved areas.

Method: A geospatial foundation model is fine-tuned using empirical urban heat data, including green space cooling effects, and tested for accuracy and future climate predictions.

Result: The model accurately predicts land surface temperatures and demonstrates practical value for mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: Geospatial foundation models effectively support urban heat island mitigation in data-scarce regions, enhancing climate resilience.

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

TL;DR: UltraGen is a novel video generation framework that efficiently produces high-resolution videos (up to 4K) using a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion transformer-based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs due to computational bottlenecks caused by quadratic attention complexity.

Method: UltraGen introduces a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture, combining global-local attention decomposition, spatially compressed global modeling, and hierarchical cross-window local attention.

Result: UltraGen successfully scales pre-trained low-resolution models to 1080P and 4K, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: UltraGen addresses the computational challenges of high-resolution video generation, offering a practical and superior solution for native high-resolution synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

### [89] [ProCLIP: Progressive Vision-Language Alignment via LLM-based Embedder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18795)
*Xiaoxing Hu,Kaicheng Yang,Ziyong Feng,Qi Ming,Zonghao Guo,Xiang An,Ziyong Feng,Junchi Yan,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProCLIP introduces a curriculum learning framework to align CLIP's image encoder with an LLM-based text embedder, addressing limitations like short input length and multilingual support while preserving CLIP's vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's text encoder has limitations (77-token max, no multilingual support) restricting its broader use. Existing LLM-based replacements disrupt CLIP's vision-language alignment. ProCLIP aims to align LLM embedders with CLIP's image encoder effectively.

Method: ProCLIP uses knowledge distillation from CLIP's text encoder to an LLM embedder, followed by image-text contrastive tuning with self-distillation regularization. Semantic and structure alignment losses are applied for better alignment.

Result: ProCLIP successfully aligns LLM embedders with CLIP's image encoder, enhancing long-text processing, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantics without disrupting pre-trained knowledge.

Conclusion: ProCLIP offers a robust solution for aligning LLM embedders with CLIP's vision-language space, expanding CLIP's applicability while preserving its intrinsic alignment.

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to provide a more intuitive derivation of steerable CNNs compared to abstract group theoretical methods, enhancing understanding and practical application.

Method: The derivation uses geometric arguments and pattern matching principles. Novel construction of steerable convolution layers employs interpolation kernels.

Result: The method offers intuitive insights into Clebsch-Gordan decomposition and spherical harmonics, and improves robustness to noisy data.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges theory and practice with intuitive geometric derivations and improved implementations for steerable CNNs.

Abstract: In contrast to the somewhat abstract, group theoretical approach adopted by
many papers, our work provides a new and more intuitive derivation of steerable
convolutional neural networks in $d$ dimensions. This derivation is based on
geometric arguments and fundamental principles of pattern matching. We offer an
intuitive explanation for the appearance of the Clebsch--Gordan decomposition
and spherical harmonic basis functions. Furthermore, we suggest a novel way to
construct steerable convolution layers using interpolation kernels that improve
upon existing implementation, and offer greater robustness to noisy data.

### [91] [An Explainable Hybrid AI Framework for Enhanced Tuberculosis and Symptom Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18819)
*Neel Patel,Alexander Wong,Ashkan Ebadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a teacher-student AI framework for detecting tuberculosis and symptoms on chest X-rays, achieving high accuracy (98.85%) and explainability, addressing data scarcity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tuberculosis detection is crucial in resource-limited areas lacking skilled radiologists, necessitating reliable AI screening tools despite data challenges.

Method: A teacher-student framework combines supervised and self-supervised heads to improve disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays.

Result: The model achieves 98.85% accuracy for disease classification and 90.09% macro-F1 score for symptom detection, with explainable predictions.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for clinical deployment, overcoming data limitations and enhancing tuberculosis screening.

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM 2++ is a unified video tracking model for tasks of varying granularity (masks, boxes, points), using task-specific prompts, a unified decoder, task-adaptive memory, and a custom data engine. It achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trackers are task-specific and lack generalization, leading to redundancy. SAM 2++ aims to unify tracking tasks across different granularities.

Method: Uses task-specific prompts, a unified decoder, task-adaptive memory mechanism, and a custom data engine with diverse annotations.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance across various tracking benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAM 2++ provides a robust and unified framework for tracking tasks at any granularity.

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

### [93] [Unifying and Enhancing Graph Transformers via a Hierarchical Mask Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18825)
*Yujie Xing,Xiao Wang,Bin Wu,Hai Huang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified hierarchical mask framework for Graph Transformers, addressing limitations in flexibility by linking model architecture to attention mask construction. It introduces M3Dphormer, a scalable and adaptive model, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Transformers lack flexibility due to complex designs tailored to specific interactions. The authors aim to unify diverse interactions through attention masks.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical mask framework and M3Dphormer, featuring multi-level masking, dual attention computation, and bi-level expert routing.

Result: M3Dphormer outperforms benchmarks, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The unified framework and M3Dphormer demonstrate superior performance, highlighting the importance of large receptive fields and label consistency in attention masks.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

### [94] [FedDEAP: Adaptive Dual-Prompt Tuning for Multi-Domain Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18837)
*Yubin Zheng,Pak-Hei Yeung,Jing Xia,Tianjie Ju,Peng Tang,Weidong Qiu,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDEAP is an adaptive federated prompt tuning framework designed to enhance CLIP's generalization in multi-domain scenarios by disentangling semantic and domain-specific features, using dual-prompt design, and aligning textual and visual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift and label heterogeneity in federated learning hinder the generalization of global models, especially when fine-tuning large-scale models like CLIP.

Method: FedDEAP uses semantic and domain transformation networks, a dual-prompt design (global semantic and local domain prompts), and aligns textual and visual representations.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show FedDEAP effectively improves CLIP's generalization for federated image recognition across domains.

Conclusion: FedDEAP successfully balances shared and personalized information in federated learning, enhancing CLIP's performance in multi-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

*Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Zhengqiang Zhang,Shihao Wang,Tianhe Wu,Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DP$^2$O-SR leverages perceptual diversity in T2I models for Real-ISR, optimizing perceptual preferences without human annotations, improving image quality across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploit the wide perceptual quality range inherent in T2I models to enhance Real-ISR performance by aligning with perceptual preferences efficiently.

Method: Introduces DP$^2$O-SR, using hybrid reward signals from IQA models, multiple preference pairs, and hierarchical preference optimization.

Result: Demonstrates improved perceptual quality and generalization across diffusion- and flow-based T2I models.

Conclusion: DP$^2$O-SR effectively harnesses perceptual diversity for superior Real-ISR outcomes.

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

*Ziang Zhang,Zehan Wang,Guanghao Zhang,Weilong Dai,Yan Xia,Ziang Yan,Minjie Hong,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Spatial Intelligence (DSI) and DSI-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating models' reasoning in dynamic 3D scenarios. It highlights limitations in current vision-language and expertise models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with dynamic 3D scenarios where both observers and objects move. This gap necessitates a benchmark to evaluate and improve spatial reasoning.

Method: The authors propose DSI-Bench, featuring nearly 1,000 dynamic videos and 1,700 annotated questions covering nine motion patterns, designed to minimize biases.

Result: Evaluation of 14 models reveals issues like conflating observer-object motion, semantic biases, and difficulties in inferring relative relationships dynamically.

Conclusion: DSI-Bench uncovers critical model limitations and provides insights for advancing general and expertise models in dynamic spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with
dynamic spatial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model artificial consciousness in LLMs by incorporating psychoanalytic concepts like self-awareness and unconsciousness.

Method: A Psychodynamic Model with agent interaction, fine-tuned on emotionally rich dialogues, evaluated via LLM judge.

Result: 71.2% preference for fine-tuned model, showing improved emotional depth and reduced output variance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for adaptive, personalized cognition in LLMs.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent framework for modeling artificial consciousness in

\textbf{Psychodynamic Model} simulates self-awareness, preconsciousness, and
unconsciousness through agent interaction, guided by a Personalization Module
combining fixed traits and dynamic needs. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning

*Hao Liu,Yiqing Dai,Haotian Tan,Yu Lei,Yujia Zhou,Zhen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs use emotion to guide moral decisions like humans but differ in cost sensitivity and fairness balance. Some models align closer to human behavior, revealing developmental parallels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs use emotion similarly to humans in moral decision-making, specifically in altruistic third-party punishment scenarios.

Method: Conducted a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents and 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, analyzing emotion-driven punishment behavior and cost sensitivity.

Result: LLMs used emotion strongly for punishment, sometimes more than humans, but lacked nuanced cost calibration and fairness balancing. Some reasoning models showed closer alignment to human behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs mirror early-stage human emotional decision-making but need improved cost sensitivity and reasoning integration for human-like emotional intelligence.

Abstract: Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use
emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party
punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a
hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a
large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100
decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly
than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more
punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting;
and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased
punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost,
enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity,
whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini,
DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than
foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven.
These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral
decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness
judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs
progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should
integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like
emotional intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POPI is a framework that distills diverse user preferences into concise summaries for personalized LLM responses, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment techniques overlook individual user preferences, and naive personalization methods are inefficient or noisy.

Method: POPI uses a preference inference model to create natural language summaries, conditioning a shared generation model via reinforcement learning.

Result: POPI improves personalization accuracy and reduces context overhead, with summaries transferable to frozen LLMs.

Conclusion: POPI offers an efficient, transparent, and transferable solution for personalized LLM responses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user
experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and
reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and
overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user
fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that
prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address
these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a
preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise
natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and
transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation
model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference
inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using
reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference
information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks
demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while
reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries
seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play
personalization without weight updates.

TL;DR: Analysis identifies neurons differentiating literary style in GPT-2, but removing these neurons improves generated prose, revealing a gap between correlation and causation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how individual neurons in GPT-2 discriminate between literary and AI-generated text, exploring the paradox of their role in analysis versus generation.

Method: Activation patterns from 355M parameters in GPT-2's late layers were analyzed using Herman Melville's 'Bartleby, the Scrivener' as a corpus. Ablation studies targeted discriminative neurons.

Result: 27,122 neurons significantly discriminate literary style ($p < 0.05$), but ablating 50 high-discriminating neurons improved prose quality by 25.7%.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a discrepancy between neurons' observational correlation with literary style and their causal role in generation, impacting AI interpretability and alignment research.

Abstract: We present a mechanistic analysis of literary style in GPT-2, identifying
individual neurons that discriminate between exemplary prose and rigid
AI-generated text. Using Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a corpus,
we extract activation patterns from 355 million parameters across 32,768
neurons in late layers. We find 27,122 statistically significant discriminative
neurons ($p < 0.05$), with effect sizes up to $|d| = 1.4$. Through systematic
ablation studies, we discover a paradoxical result: while these neurons
correlate with literary text during analysis, removing them often improves
rather than degrades generated prose quality. Specifically, ablating 50
high-discriminating neurons yields a 25.7% improvement in literary style
metrics. This demonstrates a critical gap between observational correlation and
causal necessity in neural networks. Our findings challenge the assumption that
neurons which activate on desirable inputs will produce those outputs during
generation, with implications for mechanistic interpretability research and AI
alignment.

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination and credibility issues in LLMs by enhancing pre-training data with world context (DWC), improving model safety and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations and safety concerns in LLMs stem from pre-training data issues, prompting a need for better data grounding and context.

Method: Proposes Data with World Context (DWC) to anchor pre-training data in real-world scenarios and includes industrial data, then continues pre-training JT-35B-Base with DWC tokens.

Result: JT-Safe-35B shows a 1.79% average improvement over Qwen on safety benchmarks, trained with fewer tokens.

Conclusion: Enhancing pre-training data with real-world context improves LLM safety and trustworthiness, as demonstrated by JT-Safe-35B.

Abstract: The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs)
are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a
significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference
techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that
unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,
involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.
In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost
impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical
inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack
grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence
of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome
these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its
context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting
industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors
for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a
role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we
aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby
reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and
trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue
pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC
tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of
DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an
average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy
evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Select-Then-Decompose strategy for task decomposition in LLMs, balancing performance and cost through dynamic approach selection and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task decomposition methods lack consideration of the performance-cost trade-off, prompting a need for a more balanced solution.

Method: The study categorizes task decomposition approaches, analyzes influencing factors, and proposes a three-stage (selection, execution, verification) strategy.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show the strategy achieves an optimal balance between performance and cost on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Select-Then-Decompose strategy effectively addresses the performance-cost trade-off in task decomposition for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and
planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition.
Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and
feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they
often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we
first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying
six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three
factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition:
categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of
decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and
summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we
propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop
problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and
verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition
approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the
results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across
multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on
the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and
cost. Our code is publicly available at

architecture is proposed that optimizes human moderator workload through
automated detection and incorporates continuous learning mechanisms. The
experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across
methods, with fine-tuned DistilBERT achieving optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.
The findings provide empirical evidence for deploying cost-effective, efficient
content moderation systems in dynamic online gaming environments.

### [104] [Food4All: A Multi-Agent Framework for Real-time Free Food Discovery with Integrated Nutritional Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18289)
*Zhengqing Yuan,Yiyang Li,Weixiang Sun,Zheyuan Zhang,Kaiwen Shi,Keerthiram Murugesan,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Food4All is a novel multi-agent framework designed for real-time, context-aware food retrieval to address fragmented access and unmet needs of food-insecure populations in the US.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food insecurity is linked to chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid misuse, yet existing retrieval systems fail to provide relevant, timely, or accessible solutions for vulnerable populations.

Method: Food4All integrates heterogeneous data aggregation, a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm, and an online feedback loop to optimize geographic accessibility and nutritional correctness dynamically.

Result: The framework bridges information gaps, offers real-time guidance, and adapts to evolving user needs, providing nutritionally annotated food resources.

Conclusion: Food4All represents a scalable, equitable solution to support food-insecure populations by addressing critical barriers like proximity, availability, and contextual constraints.

Abstract: Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United
States, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid
misuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,
access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static
directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and
geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague
nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as
time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems
optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of
food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified
availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most
vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital
illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we
introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for
real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three
innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,
community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of
food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on
curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional
correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval
policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic
analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and
guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward
scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations
facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.

### [105] [Diagnosing Representation Dynamics in NER Model Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17930)
*Xirui Zhang,Philippe de La Chevasnerie,Benoit Fabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores extending NER models to new PII entities in noisy spoken-language data, finding minimal degradation for original classes when jointly fine-tuning BERT. It identifies LOC vulnerability due to representation overlap and a 'reverse O-tag drift' issue resolved by unfreezing the 'O' tag's classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how NER models adapt to new PII entities without degrading performance on existing semantic entities, focusing on feature mechanisms and representation overlaps.

Method: The authors use an incremental learning setup to analyze semantic drift, investigating feature independence and classifier behavior, particularly the 'O' tag's role.

Result: Key findings include LOC's vulnerability due to pattern-like feature overlap and a 'reverse O-tag drift' that blocks new learning until the 'O' tag's classifier is unfrozen.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into NER model adaptation, emphasizing feature independence, representation overlap, and the plasticity of the 'O' tag classifier.

Abstract: Extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new PII entities in noisy
spoken-language data is a common need. We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT
model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII
(EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We
investigate this "peaceful coexistence," hypothesizing that the model uses
independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.
  Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic
drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely
vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares
pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a "reverse
O-tag representation drift." The model, initially trained to map PII patterns
to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's
classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and "release" these
patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation,
highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag
plasticity.

*Jizhan Fang,Xinle Deng,Haoming Xu,Ziyan Jiang,Yuqi Tang,Ziwen Xu,Shumin Deng,Yunzhi Yao,Mengru Wang,Shuofei Qiao,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightMem introduces an efficient memory system for LLMs, inspired by human memory models, to improve performance without significant overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory systems for LLMs introduce high computational and time costs, limiting their practicality in dynamic environments.

Method: LightMem organizes memory into three stages: sensory memory for filtering and grouping, short-term memory for topic-based consolidation, and long-term memory updated offline.

Result: Experiments show LightMem improves accuracy (up to 10.9%) while reducing token usage (117x), API calls (159x), and runtime (12x).

Conclusion: LightMem balances performance and efficiency, making it a practical solution for memory systems in LLMs.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle
to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and
complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless
interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and
utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce
substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new
memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance
and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of
human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,
cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information
through lightweight compression and groups information according to their
topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based
groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,
long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that
decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with
GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in
accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API
calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at

*Haoyu Huang,Hong Ting Tsang,Jiaxin Bai,Xi Peng,Gong Zhang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AtlasKV introduces a parametric method to integrate billion-scale KGs into LLMs efficiently, avoiding reliance on external retrievers and long context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG methods rely on external retrieval, causing high latency and inefficiency for large-scale knowledge augmentation.

Method: AtlasKV uses KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KGs into LLMs with sub-linear complexity, leveraging LLMs' attention without external tools.

Result: Achieves efficient knowledge grounding (<20GB VRAM) and generalization without retraining or retrievers.

Conclusion: AtlasKV provides a scalable, memory-efficient solution for large-scale KG integration in LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown some success in augmenting
large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, as a
non-parametric knowledge integration paradigm for LLMs, RAG methods heavily
rely on external retrieval modules and the retrieved textual context prior.
Especially for very large scale knowledge augmentation, they would introduce
substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and much longer
relevant context. In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration
method, called \textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to
augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using
very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we
introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with
sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding
and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism,
and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when
adapting to new knowledge.

*Stewart Slocum,Julian Minder,Clément Dumas,Henry Sleight,Ryan Greenblatt,Samuel Marks,Rowan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to measure belief depth in LLMs after knowledge editing, evaluating techniques like Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if knowledge editing techniques truly implant beliefs in LLMs or if they superficially adopt new facts.

Method: Operationalize belief depth via generalization, robustness, and representation similarity, testing techniques like SDF.

Result: SDF often implants deep beliefs resembling genuine knowledge, but contradictions with world knowledge remain brittle.

Conclusion: Provides measurable criteria for belief depth, enabling rigorous evaluation of knowledge editing techniques.

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques promise to implant new factual knowledge into
large language models (LLMs). But do LLMs really believe these facts? We
develop a framework to measure belief depth and use it to evaluate the success
of knowledge editing techniques. We operationalize belief depth as the extent
to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi
estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and
direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as
measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and
mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast,
Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated
documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that
behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal,
as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and
representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work
introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous
evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world
applications.

*Nishant Subramani,Alfredo Gomez,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimBA is a three-phase framework simplifying benchmark analysis for language models by identifying representative subsets to predict overall performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language model benchmarks are complex and hard to interpret for model selection, necessitating a simpler analysis method.

Method: SimBA's three phases involve dataset/model comparisons (stalk), discovering representative subsets (prowl), and predicting performance on held-out models (pounce).

Result: SimBA reduces benchmark sizes significantly (e.g., 6.25% for HELM) while maintaining 95% coverage and near-zero error in performance prediction.

Conclusion: SimBA enhances efficiency in model training and helps validate new datasets against existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult
to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation
numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase
framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk,
where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a
representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to
predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three
popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all
three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk).
We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark
using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25%
(1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and
BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl).
Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve
model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero
mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers
improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether
their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our
code is open source, available at https://github.com/nishantsubramani/simba.

*Asim Mohamed,Martin Gubri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing multilingual watermarking methods lack robustness in medium- and low-resource languages. STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method, improves watermark strength post-translation, offering compatibility, robustness, and scalability across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual watermarking methods are evaluated only on high-resource languages and fail under translation attacks in medium- and low-resource languages. This limits their practical utility and fairness.

Method: The authors introduce STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method that enhances watermark strength lost during translation. It works with any watermarking method and is designed to be non-invasive and extendable.

Result: STEAM shows significant improvements, with average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% across 17 languages, proving its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: STEAM provides a simple, robust solution for fairer multilingual watermarking, addressing gaps in existing methods and enhancing traceability across diverse languages.

Abstract: Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs
traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite
claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource
languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not
truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in
medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic
clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few
full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a
back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost
through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust
across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable
to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17
languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking
across diverse languages.

*Mahsa Valizadeh,Xiangjue Dong,Rui Tuo,James Caverlee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMAR is a framework using LLMs to enrich sequential interaction data with inferred semantic signals, improving performance in benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve sequential modeling tasks where semantic context is limited or absent.

Method: LaMAR leverages LLMs in few-shot settings to generate auxiliary contextual signals (e.g., usage scenarios, item intents) from metadata.

Result: Consistent performance improvements in benchmarks; LLM-generated signals show high semantic novelty and diversity.

Conclusion: LaMAR introduces a data-centric paradigm where LLMs act as intelligent context generators, enhancing downstream models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and
contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user
behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such
semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven
semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically.
LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual
signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item
relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred
usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original
sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this
generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks,
where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that
LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing
the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a
new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators,
contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and
language resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to translate texts with inter-sentential dependencies, using prompts with and without chain-of-thought reasoning. Top models like GPT-4 achieve ~90% accuracy and ~92% COMET scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' translation capabilities, especially for challenging tasks involving pronominal anaphora and lexical cohesion.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs on the DiscEvalMT benchmark for two tasks: distinguishing correct translations and generating them, comparing prompts with and without chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Best models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, Phi) achieved ~90% accuracy and ~92% COMET scores, showing improvements with reasoning.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought reasoning enhances LLMs' translation performance, with stronger models benefiting more ('wise get wiser' effect).

Abstract: This paper assesses the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to translate
texts that include inter-sentential dependencies. We use the English-French
DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing
translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion.
We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families
on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but
plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that
encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models
take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and
COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi
standing out. Moreover, we observe a "wise get wiser" effect: the improvements
through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models
without reasoning.

Method: Evaluated reasoning model DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and instruct model LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on the FIREBALL dataset for command generation.

Result: Prompt specificity significantly impacts model output, and instruct models are more effective than reasoning models for this task.

Conclusion: Instruct models suffice for predicting player actions and generating Avrae commands, emphasizing the importance of precise instructions.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and

*William Lugoloobi,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) internally encode problem difficulty similarly to humans and how this affects generalization during reinforcement learning. Findings show human-labeled difficulty is strongly decodable and scales with model size, while LLM-derived difficulty is weaker and scales poorly. Steering models toward "easier" representations improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand why LLMs inconsistently solve complex problems but fail on simpler ones, exploring whether their internal representations of difficulty align with human judgment and impact performance.

Method: Linear probes were trained across layers and token positions on 60 models, evaluated on mathematical and coding subsets of Easy2HardBench. Difficulty signals were compared during GRPO training.

Result: Human-labeled difficulty was strongly decodable ($\rho \approx 0.88$) and scaled with model size, whereas LLM-derived difficulty was weaker and scaled poorly. Steering models toward "easier" representations improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal amplified by reinforcement learning, while automated difficulty estimates misalign as models improve. Probe code and scripts are released for replication.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency: they solve complex
problems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether
LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human
judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during
reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and
token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of
Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly
decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling,
whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly.
Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward
"easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During
GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and
positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the
LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These
results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that
RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model
performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe
code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.

*Dan Friedman,Adithya Bhaskar,Alexander Wettig,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes rule-based descriptions for interpretability in transformers, moving beyond subjective exemplar inspection to define and extract three types of rules (skip-gram, absence, counting) from GPT-2's attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide clearer, more objective interpretations of model features by replacing subjective exemplar inspections with rule-based descriptions.

Method: Extracts three types of rule-based descriptions (skip-gram, absence, counting) from attention layers in GPT-2 small, focusing on token patterns and their impact on output likelihood.

Result: Most features can be described well with skip-gram rules, absence rules are common early, and counting rules are identified.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for future research into rule-based feature descriptions, offering a taxonomy and extraction method.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of
bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a
sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only
identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual
interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.
This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that
match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the
likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based
descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While
prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may
naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output
features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form
"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English", (2) absence rules of the form
"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only
when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.
Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of
exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or
incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these
types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.
We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100
skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first
layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of
counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into
rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be
extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they
represent.

TL;DR: A novel method for adaptive prompt generation leverages task descriptions and a knowledge base of techniques to automate high-quality prompt creation, outperforming existing tools on 23 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt engineering is complex and requires expertise, limiting accessibility for non-experts. This work aims to simplify and automate prompt creation.

Method: The method uses a knowledge base linking task clusters to prompting techniques, dynamically generating prompts based on user task descriptions.

Result: Outperformed standard prompts and automated tools on 23 BBEH tasks, measured by arithmetic and harmonic mean scores.

Conclusion: The approach streamlines prompt creation, making LLMs more accessible to non-experts without compromising performance.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs
from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized
knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects
task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task
descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying
on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a
knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic
similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques.
When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most
relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating
techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the
proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates
superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic
prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean
scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and
standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CMT-Bench evaluates LLMs' robustness in dynamic text-to-table tasks using cricket commentary, revealing brittleness in handling schema evolution and surface variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven text-to-table systems rely on costly methods and obscure reasoning. CMT-Bench probes model robustness in dynamic scenarios.

Method: CMT-Bench tests models via extractive-cue ablation, temporal prefixing, and entity-form perturbations to assess robustness.

Result: LLMs show significant accuracy drops without extractive summaries, degrade with input length, and are sensitive to surface variations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are brittle in dynamic text-to-table tasks, highlighting the need for robustness-first evaluation.

Abstract: LLM Driven text-to-table (T2T) systems often rely on extensive
prompt-engineering or iterative event extraction in code-parsable formats,
which boosts scores but are computationally expensive and obscure how models
actually reason over temporal evolving narratives to summarise key information.
We present CMT-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark built from live cricket commentary
that requires dynamic table generation across two evolving schemas under a
dense, rule-governed policy. CMT-Bench is designed to probe robustness via
three semantics-preserving dimensions: (i) extractive-cue ablation to separate
extractive shortcuts from state tracking, (ii) temporal prefixing to test
long-context stability, and (iii) entity-form perturbations (anonymization,
outof-distribution substitutions, role-entangling paraphrases) to assess
sensitivity to surface variation. Across diverse long-context stateof-the-art
LLMs, we find large drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation
with input length, and consistent accuracy drop under entity-form changes.
Complementary distributional tests confirm significant shifts in numeric error
patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than mere noise. Our results
show that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic Textto-table generation,
motivating robustness-first evaluation as a prerequisite for developing
efficient and scalable approaches for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the unreliability of LLMs-as-judges in direct assessment tasks, particularly their sensitivity to pre-defined score ranges, which affects evaluation accuracy.

Method: The proposed method involves analyzing score range bias in LLM outputs and mitigating it using contrastive decoding.

Result: The results show an 11.3% relative improvement in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score ranges.

Conclusion: The conclusion underscores the effectiveness of contrastive decoding in reducing bias and enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used as evaluators in various
applications, but the reliability of the outcomes remains a challenge. One such
challenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores
from a specified range without any references. We first show that this
challenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias,
i.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges,
preventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar
biases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias
through contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on
average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score
ranges.

*Sriharsh Bhyravajjula,Ujwal Narayan,Manish Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARCUS, an NLP pipeline for computationally generating relation-based character arcs from narratives, evaluated on Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a quantitative representation of theoretical character arcs, enhancing literary analysis and enabling practical applications.

Method: MARCUS extracts events, characters, emotions, and sentiment to model inter-character relations, aggregating them into graphical plots.

Result: Character arcs were successfully generated for Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, demonstrating the pipeline's feasibility.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise but faces challenges; future work aims to refine the pipeline and explore further applications.

Abstract: Character arcs are important theoretical devices employed in literary studies
to understand character journeys, identify tropes across literary genres, and
establish similarities between narratives. This work addresses the novel task
of computationally generating event-centric, relation-based character arcs from
narratives. Providing a quantitative representation for arcs brings tangibility
to a theoretical concept and paves the way for subsequent applications. We
present MARCUS (Modelling Arcs for Understanding Stories), an NLP pipeline that
extracts events, participant characters, implied emotion, and sentiment to
model inter-character relations. MARCUS tracks and aggregates these relations
across the narrative to generate character arcs as graphical plots. We generate
character arcs from two extended fantasy series, Harry Potter and Lord of the
Rings. We evaluate our approach before outlining existing challenges,
suggesting applications of our pipeline, and discussing future work.

*Tao Tao,Guanghui Zhu,Lang Guo,Hongyi Chen,Chunfeng Yuan,Yihua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt Optimization for LLMs often falls into local optima and lacks transferability. DelvePO, a task-agnostic framework, decouples prompts and uses working memory to guide self-evolving optimization, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Prompt Optimization methods are unstable and task-specific, leading to local optima and poor transferability.

Method: DelvePO decouples prompts into components, uses working memory to guide LLMs, and evolves prompts dynamically.

Result: DelvePO outperforms SOTA methods across diverse tasks and LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Qwen2.5, GPT-4o-mini).

Conclusion: DelvePO offers effective, flexible, and transferable Prompt Optimization for LLMs.

Abstract: Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities
in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current
works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization
process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to
fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is
often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address
the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{DelvePO}$
($\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\textbf{e}$d Se$\textbf{l}$f-E$\textbf{v}$olving
Framework for Fl$\textbf{e}$xible $\textbf{P}$rompt $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a
task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our
framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to
explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this
basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the
deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights
to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on
different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.
Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA
methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness
and transferability across different tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Visual text representations can compress inputs for LLMs by rendering text as images, reducing token usage without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether textual inputs can be compressed by converting them into images to save tokens while maintaining model performance.

Method: Render long text inputs as images and feed them directly to decoder LLMs, reducing token usage.

Result: Substantial token savings (often nearly half) achieved on benchmarks (RULER and CNN/DailyMail) without degrading performance.

Conclusion: Visual text representation is an effective and practical method for input compression in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process
visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question:
can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage
while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text
representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input
compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs
as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to
dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of
input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER
(long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we
demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings
(often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT) and Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) to improve Braille processing, addressing data scarcity and translation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Braille accessibility faces issues like data scarcity and mixed-text ambiguities, necessitating better methods for processing and translation.

Method: The authors construct Braille datasets (EBMD/CBMD) and propose BKFT, a syntax tree-based augmentation method, leveraging instruction tuning for unified Braille tasks.

Result: BKFT outperforms traditional fine-tuning in Braille translation, achieving significant improvements.

Conclusion: The open-sourced datasets and BKFT method advance low-resource multilingual Braille research.

Abstract: Braille plays a vital role in education and information accessibility for
visually impaired individuals. However, Braille information processing faces
challenges such as data scarcity and ambiguities in mixed-text contexts. We
construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with
mathematical formulas to support diverse Braille domain research, and propose a
syntax tree-based augmentation method tailored for Braille data. To address the
underperformance of traditional fine-tuning methods in Braille-related tasks,
we investigate Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT), which reduces the
learning difficulty of Braille contextual features. BrailleLLM employs BKFT via
instruction tuning to achieve unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille
conversion, and mixed-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that BKFT
achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in
Braille translation scenarios. Our open-sourced datasets and methodologies
establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille research.

*Lei Li,Xiao Zhou,Yingying Zhang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedRGAG is a unified retrieval-generation framework for medical QA that combines external and internal knowledge to improve answer reliability, outperforming previous methods by 12.5% and 4.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RAG and GAG for medical QA have limitations—RAG suffers from noisy retrieval, and GAG risks hallucinations. MedRGAG aims to unify both approaches for better performance.

Method: MedRGAG integrates retrieval and generation via two modules: KGCC complements missing knowledge, and KADS selects optimal document combinations for evidence.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show MedRGAG outperforms MedRAG by 12.5% and MedGENIE by 4.5%.

Conclusion: MedRGAG effectively unifies retrieval and generation, enhancing knowledge-intensive reasoning in medical QA.

Abstract: Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific
knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge
stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two
categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning
on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),
which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual
documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while
GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to
unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine
answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified
retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external
and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:
Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to
produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by
retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively
selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form
concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments
on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%
improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the
effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive
reasoning. Our code and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain-adapted LLMs show promise in healthcare, with finetuned models outperforming base versions but lagging behind general-purpose models like Claude Sonnet 3.7 in expert evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore optimal adaptation strategies and evaluate performance of domain-specific LLMs in healthcare, particularly electrocardiography, compared to general-purpose models.

Method: Finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific literature and comparing them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Claude Sonnet 3.7 using a multi-layered evaluation framework.

Result: Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B performed best in multiple-choice tests and automatic metrics, while Claude 3.7 and RAG were preferred for complex queries. Finetuned models outperformed base models across evaluations.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation via finetuning and RAG is viable for privacy-preserving clinical solutions, though performance varies by evaluation method.

Abstract: Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) offer promising
healthcare applications, from queryable knowledge bases to multimodal
assistants, with the crucial advantage of local deployment for privacy
preservation. However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies,
and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized.
We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of
cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific
literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing
finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7
as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved
superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics,
ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert
evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned
models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all
evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity
across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity.
Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of
privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.

*Vipul Rathore,Malik Hammad Faisal,Parag Singla,Mausam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HYDRE is a hybrid framework combining DSRE models with LLM-based ICL to improve relation extraction accuracy, especially in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing noisy annotations in DSRE and exploring LLM integration for better performance.

Method: Uses DSRE models to identify candidate relations and dynamically retrieves reliable exemplars for LLM prompts.

Result: Achieves up to 20 F1 gains in English and 17 F1 points average in Indic languages.

Conclusion: HYDRE outperforms SoTA DSRE models, demonstrating efficacy in diverse linguistic settings.

Abstract: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing
challenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations
while making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA)
DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context
learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key
challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to
noisy annotation.
  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation
Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k
candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic
exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars
from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the
final relation(s).
  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource
languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods
on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse
low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE
achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on
Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's
efficacy compared to other prompting strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KrishokBondhu is a voice-enabled agricultural advisory platform for Bengali farmers, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware advice, achieving high-quality responses and outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers in Bangladesh lack timely expert advice. KrishokBondhu aims to bridge this gap with accessible, multilingual voice-based guidance.

Method: The system digitizes agricultural resources, indexes them for semantic retrieval, and uses OCR, speech-to-text, RAG, and text-to-speech to deliver real-time advice.

Result: Pilot evaluation showed 72.7% high-quality responses, outperforming benchmarks by 44.7%, especially in contextual richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%).

Conclusion: KrishokBondhu proves feasibility of AI-driven advisory systems, integrating call-centre accessibility and multilingual voice interaction for remote farmers.

Abstract: In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely,
expert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a
voice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for
Bengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural
handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the
content; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic
retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system
to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali
query, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma
3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the
answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced
high-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop
management, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the
KisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on
a 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual
richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable
relevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further
revealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,
emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated
documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG
techniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi
farmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory
ecosystem.

Motivation: To assess LLMs' factuality in Korean cultural knowledge by creating a challenging yet easily gradable benchmark.

Method: Developed KoSimpleQA with 1,000 short, unambiguous fact-seeking questions and evaluated diverse open-source LLMs supporting Korean.

Result: Highest-performing model achieved only 33.7% accuracy, differing from English benchmarks; reasoning capabilities improved knowledge elicitation and abstention.

Conclusion: KoSimpleQA highlights unique challenges in Korean cultural knowledge evaluation and the potential of reasoning LLMs in factual QA tasks.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{Korean SimpleQA (KoSimpleQA)}$, a benchmark for
evaluating factuality in large language models (LLMs) with a focus on Korean
cultural knowledge. KoSimpleQA is designed to be challenging yet easy to grade,
consisting of 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of open-source LLMs of
varying sizes that support Korean, and find that even the strongest model
generates correct answer only 33.7% of the time, underscoring the challenging
nature of KoSimpleQA. Notably, performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ
substantially from those on the English SimpleQA, highlighting the unique value
of our dataset. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning LLMs shows that engaging
reasoning capabilities in the factual QA task can both help models better
elicit their latent knowledge and improve their ability to abstain when
uncertain. KoSimpleQA can be found at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes fairness-prompted finetuning for English ASR systems to address fairness gaps across accent groups, achieving significant improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fairness gaps in English ASR systems for second-language speakers by analyzing widely used models (Whisper and Seamless-M4T) and proposing solutions.

Method: Fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating Spectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). Combines traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with fairness-driven objectives.

Result: Achieves relative improvements of 58.7% and 58.5% over Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and 7.8% over standard ERM finetuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances fairness across accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of building fair English ASR systems
for second-language speakers. Our analysis of widely used ASR models, Whisper
and Seamless-M4T, reveals large fluctuations in word error rate (WER) across 26
accent groups, indicating significant fairness gaps. To mitigate this, we
propose fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating
Spectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization
(Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). Our proposed fusion of
traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy and
fairness-driven objectives (SD, Group DRO, and IRM) enhances fairness across
accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy. In terms of
macro-averaged word error rate, our approach achieves a relative improvement of
58.7% and 58.5% over the large pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and
7.8% over them, finetuning with standard empirical risk minimization with
cross-entropy loss.

TL;DR: MENTOR combines RL and teacher-guided distillation to improve generalization and strategic competence in SLMs, outperforming SFT and sparse-reward RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SFT and sparse-reward RL fail to generalize or guide SLMs effectively in tool-using tasks.

Method: MENTOR uses RL with dense, teacher-guided rewards from reference trajectories for fine-grained guidance.

Result: MENTOR outperforms SFT and sparse-reward RL in cross-domain generalization and strategic competence.

Conclusion: MENTOR offers a robust solution for distilling LLM capabilities into SLMs, addressing key limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into
smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for
their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static
set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While
reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse
rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with
inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these
distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically
combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,
MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through
exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a
teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided
reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and
strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adamas is a lightweight sparse attention mechanism for long-context LLMs, using Hadamard transform and Manhattan-distance estimation to maintain accuracy with high sparsity and speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic cost and latency of self-attention in large language models with extended contexts.

Method: Applies Hadamard transform, bucketization, 2-bit compression, and Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections.

Result: Matches full attention accuracy with a 64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports 8x higher sparsity with 4.4x speedups.

Conclusion: Adamas effectively maintains accuracy under aggressive sparsity, surpassing prior SOTA methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of
thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document
summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering
and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate
the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in
autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these
costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value
(KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce
Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed
for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform,
bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and
leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections.
Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a
64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to
8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering
up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences.
Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full
attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under
aggressive sparsity.

TL;DR: CoCT, a prompt-based paradigm leveraging chains of concepts, outperforms baselines in open-domain tasks by encouraging deeper strategic thinking from LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of CoT in open-domain tasks where reasoning steps are unclear, enabling LLMs to perform better in broader contexts.

Method: Propose CoCT: LLM tags concepts (emotions, strategies, topics) before generating content, allowing concept chains within an utterance.

Result: CoCT surpasses baselines like Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT, and RAG in evaluations.

Conclusion: CoCT is a promising paradigm for enhancing LLM performance in open-domain tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is widely applied to improve the LLM capability in
math, coding and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is limited for
open-domain tasks since there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical
transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose another prompt-based
paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT), where the LLM first tags a
concept, then generates the detailed content. The chain of concepts is allowed
within the utterance, encouraging the LLM's deep and strategic thinking. We
experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations
where the concept is comprised of emotions, strategies and topics. Automatic,
human and model evaluations suggest that CoCT surpasses baselines such as
Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential effective
prompt-based paradigm of LLM for a wider scope of tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in sign language translation (SLT) models, proposing a token-level reliability measure to quantify visual grounding and improve hallucination detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in SLT models undermine accuracy by relying on language priors over visual evidence, especially problematic in gloss-free models lacking intermediate alignment.

Method: Proposes combining feature-based sensitivity (measuring internal changes when video is masked) with counterfactual signals (probability differences between clean/altered inputs) into a reliability score.

Result: Reliability scores predict hallucination rates, generalize across datasets/architectures, and decrease with visual degradations. Combined with text-based signals, they improve risk estimation.

Conclusion: The reliability measure is a practical tool for diagnosing SLT hallucinations, paving the way for robust multimodal generation.

Abstract: Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual
evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly
critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise
grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because
they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without
intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that
hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual
input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that
quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines
feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is
masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences
between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a
sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure
of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks
(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our
results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across
datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond
these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded
tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when
combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it
further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights
why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,
our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for
diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust
hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

Motivation: To address safety concerns about LLM outputs by examining the relationship between humor generation and harmful content like stereotypes and toxicity.

Method: Jointly measures humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity in LLM outputs across six models, supplemented by information-theoretic incongruity analysis and external validation with satire-generation tasks.

Result: Harmful outputs receive higher humor scores, especially under role-based prompting, and harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty. Stereotypical/toxic jokes gain 10-21% in humor scores and appear more frequently in funny outputs.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit bias amplification loops between generators and evaluators, with harmful punchlines structurally embedded in humor distributions, raising concerns for safe deployment.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for creative writing and
engagement content, raising safety concerns about the outputs. Therefore,
casting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness
optimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly
measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented
by analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across
six models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which
further increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification
loop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show
harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make
harmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural
embedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional
satire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM
satire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed
models. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\%$ in mean humor
score, stereotypical jokes appear $11\%$ to $28\%$ more often among the jokes
marked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\%$ more often in generations
perceived as funny by humans.

*Liyang He,Yuren Zhang,Ziwei Zhu,Zhenghui Li,Shiwei Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChronoPlay is a novel framework for automated benchmarking of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in gaming, addressing dual dynamics of game updates and player focus shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized benchmarks for RAG systems in dynamic domains like online gaming, hindered by dual dynamics of game updates and player focus shifts.

Method: ChronoPlay uses a dual-dynamic update mechanism and dual-source synthesis engine to generate benchmarks from official and player community sources.

Result: Implemented on three games, ChronoPlay creates the first dynamic RAG benchmark for gaming, revealing insights into model performance.

Conclusion: ChronoPlay successfully addresses the challenge of benchmarking RAG systems in gaming by ensuring authenticity and adaptability.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in
dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has
impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual
Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting
focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a
benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to
ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge,
we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous
generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update
mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine
that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual
correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three
distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain,
offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic
conditions. Code is avaliable at: https://github.com/hly1998/ChronoPlay.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DePass is a unified framework for fine-grained feature attribution in Transformer models using decomposed forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpreting Transformer models' internal computations and provide faithful attribution without auxiliary training.

Method: DePass decomposes hidden states into additive components and propagates them with fixed attention scores and MLP activations.

Result: Validated across token-level, component-level, and subspace-level tasks, demonstrating effectiveness and fidelity.

Conclusion: DePass offers foundational potential for broader interpretability applications in Transformer models.

Abstract: Attributing the behavior of Transformer models to internal computations is a
central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. We introduce DePass, a
unified framework for feature attribution based on a single decomposed forward
pass. DePass decomposes hidden states into customized additive components, then
propagates them with attention scores and MLP's activations fixed. It achieves
faithful, fine-grained attribution without requiring auxiliary training. We
validate DePass across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level
attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity. Our
experiments highlight its potential to attribute information flow between
arbitrary components of a Transformer model. We hope DePass serves as a
foundational tool for broader applications in interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a WordNet annotated with CEFR levels, using semantic similarity measurement via a language model. It validates the method with a large-scale corpus, showing comparable performance to gold-standard annotations and achieving practical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make WordNet's fine-grained sense distinctions more accessible for second-language learners by integrating CEFR language-proficiency levels.

Method: Automated annotation of WordNet senses with CEFR levels using a language model for semantic similarity, validated with a corpus and contextual lexical classifiers.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the corpus perform comparably to gold-standard models; a combined classifier achieves a Macro-F1 score of 0.81.

Conclusion: The annotated WordNet and tools bridge NLP and language education, aiding more effective learning.

Abstract: Although WordNet is a valuable resource owing to its structured semantic
networks and extensive vocabulary, its fine-grained sense distinctions can be
challenging for second-language learners. To address this, we developed a
WordNet annotated with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
(CEFR), integrating its semantic networks with language-proficiency levels. We
automated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic
similarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English
Vocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale
corpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated
WordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers. Our experiments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our corpus perform comparably to those
trained on gold-standard annotations. Furthermore, by combining our corpus with
the gold-standard data, we developed a practical classifier that achieves a
Macro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating the high accuracy of our annotations. Our
annotated WordNet, corpus, and classifiers are publicly available to help
bridge the gap between natural language processing and language education,
thereby facilitating more effective and efficient language learning.

*Antonio Romano,Giuseppe Riccio,Mariano Barone,Marco Postiglione,Vincenzo Moscato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two Italian medical benchmarks (IMB-QA and IMB-MCQA) for multilingual medical question answering, showing that specialized LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation outperform general-purpose models in clarity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online medical forums contain valuable knowledge but pose challenges for automated systems due to informal language and linguistic complexity, especially in non-English contexts.

Method: The authors develop two datasets (IMB-QA and IMB-MCQA) and evaluate LLMs using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Specialized adaptation strategies like RAG and fine-tuning outperform general-purpose LLMs in medical QA tasks.

Conclusion: Effective medical AI systems benefit more from domain expertise and efficient information retrieval than larger model scale; the datasets are released for further research.

Abstract: Online medical forums have long served as vital platforms where patients seek
professional healthcare advice, generating vast amounts of valuable knowledge.
However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions
pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems,
especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two
comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644
patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \textbf{IMB-MCQA},
comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty
examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged
to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining
their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM
architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our
experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific
fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform
larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These
findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain
expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale.
We release both datasets and evaluation frameworks in our GitHub repository to
support further research on multilingual medical question answering:

*Mariano Barone,Antonio Laudante,Giuseppe Riccio,Antonio Romano,Marco Postiglione,Vincenzo Moscato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DART, a structured corpus of Italian drug regulatory texts, addressing gaps in non-English resources. It uses a reproducible pipeline for document retrieval and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pharmacological NLP research relies heavily on English corpora, creating a lack of resources for other healthcare systems, like Italy's.

Method: Developed a reproducible pipeline involving document retrieval, semantic segmentation, and few-shot-tuned LLM summarization to create DART.

Result: DART effectively structures pharmacological data, validated by an LLM-based drug interaction checker showing accurate clinical inference.

Conclusion: DART fills a critical gap in non-English pharmacological resources, demonstrating LLMs' effectiveness in clinical applications.

Abstract: The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has
become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications
ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support.
However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language
corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to
other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug
Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian
Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of
the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a
reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic
segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a
few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART
provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as
indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate
its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that
leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental
results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential
interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured
textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (DLMs) underperform autoregressive (AR) models in speed despite their parallel decoding potential, highlighting inefficiencies and limited acceleration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underperformance of DLMs in speed compared to AR models and identify gaps in evaluation methods and acceleration strategies.

Method: Empirical benchmarking and roofline-based theoretical analysis to compare DLMs and AR models, along with investigation of acceleration techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding.

Result: AR models generally achieve higher throughput than DLMs; acceleration strategies offer limited benefits, especially at scale.

Conclusion: Robust evaluation methods and better acceleration strategies are needed to improve DLM efficiency and practical utility.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable
decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current
open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting
their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM
efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through
empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs
consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that
techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small
batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration
strategies to advance research on DLMs.

### [141] [Identity-Aware Large Language Models require Cultural Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18510)
*Alistair Plum,Anne-Marie Lutgen,Christoph Purschke,Achim Rettinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of cultural reasoning in large language models, advocating for its recognition as a foundational capability alongside accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models default to Western norms, overlooking global diversity, which can sustain stereotypes and erode trust.

Method: Defines cultural reasoning and suggests broader datasets and improved evaluation methods to assess adaptive reasoning.

Result: Fine-tuning on survey data partially helps, but broader cultural competence requires foundational changes.

Conclusion: Cultural reasoning must be prioritized to ensure AI responds sensitively to diverse cultural contexts.

Abstract: Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language
processing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However,
their replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the
diversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as
cultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to
recognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its
output so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because
culture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,
cultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is
limited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority
perspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies
strongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging
moral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning
on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation
methods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive
reasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone
ensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning
must be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and
linguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial
directions for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be
able to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human
culture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure responsible and equitable development of healthcare AI by understanding how training data influences model behavior and bias.

Method: Analyzes biases in clinical models using HC4 dataset (89B tokens) and evaluates with general benchmarks and a novel healthcare-specific methodology.

Result: Provides insights into potential biases in opioid prescription tendencies across diverse demographic groups.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for transparent evaluation frameworks to improve fairness and safety in clinical AI applications.

Abstract: Large language models offer transformative potential for healthcare, yet
their responsible and equitable development depends critically on a deeper
understanding of how training data characteristics influence model behavior,
including the potential for bias. Current practices in dataset curation and
bias assessment often lack the necessary transparency, creating an urgent need
for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to foster trust and guide improvements.
In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of potential downstream biases
in clinical language models, with a focus on differential opioid prescription
tendencies across diverse demographic groups, such as ethnicity, gender, and
age. As part of this investigation, we introduce HC4: Healthcare Comprehensive
Commons Corpus, a novel and extensively curated pretraining dataset exceeding
89 billion tokens. Our evaluation leverages both established general benchmarks
and a novel, healthcare-specific methodology, offering crucial insights to
support fairness and safety in clinical AI applications.

*Dennis Assenmacher,Paloma Piot,Katarina Laken,David Jurgens,Claudia Wagner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the overlooked issue of digital dehumanization in computational linguistics, proposing a bilingual dataset to capture subtle forms of dehumanization and achieving superior model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in research focusing only on overtly negative statements, neglecting subtler forms of dehumanization that harm marginalized groups online.

Method: Collected a bilingual dataset from Twitter and Reddit, annotated by crowdworkers and experts, and fine-tuned ML models on this dataset.

Result: The dataset covers diverse dehumanization dimensions, and the models outperformed state-of-the-art ones in zero and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and benchmarking, advancing detection of subtle dehumanization.

Abstract: Digital dehumanization, although a critical issue, remains largely overlooked
within the field of computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
The prevailing approach in current research concentrating primarily on a single
aspect of dehumanization that identifies overtly negative statements as its
core marker. This focus, while crucial for understanding harmful online
communications, inadequately addresses the broader spectrum of dehumanization.
Specifically, it overlooks the subtler forms of dehumanization that, despite
not being overtly offensive, still perpetuate harmful biases against
marginalized groups in online interactions. These subtler forms can insidiously
reinforce negative stereotypes and biases without explicit offensiveness,
making them harder to detect yet equally damaging. Recognizing this gap, we use
different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from
Twitter and Reddit. Using crowdworkers and experts to annotate 16,000 instances
on a document- and span-level, we show that our dataset covers the different
dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset serves as both a training resource
for machine learning models and a benchmark for evaluating future
dehumanization detection techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
fine-tune ML models on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses
state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

*Sam Kirkham,Patrycja Strycharczuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ultrasound tongue kinematics reliably estimate dynamical parameters comparable to EMA data, supporting its use in articulatory models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether ultrasound imaging can reliably estimate dynamical parameters for speech control models, traditionally evaluated using EMA.

Method: Compare dynamical parameters (from a linear harmonic oscillator) estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics with those from simultaneously-recorded EMA data.

Result: Ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters; jaw motion is also adequately captured.

Conclusion: Ultrasound kinematics are a viable alternative to EMA for evaluating dynamical articulatory models.

Abstract: The control of speech can be modelled as a dynamical system in which
articulators are driven toward target positions. These models are typically
evaluated using fleshpoint data, such as electromagnetic articulography (EMA),
but recent methodological advances make ultrasound imaging a promising
alternative. We evaluate whether the parameters of a linear harmonic oscillator
can be reliably estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics and compare these
with parameters estimated from simultaneously-recorded EMA data. We find that
ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters, while mandibular
short tendon tracking also adequately captures jaw motion. This supports using
ultrasound kinematics to evaluate dynamical articulatory models.

Motivation: Balancing performance in multilingual ASR across languages remains challenging, prompting exploration of efficient alternatives to Transformers.

Method: MLMA uses Mamba, a state-space model for long-context processing, incorporating language-aware conditioning and shared representations.

Result: MLMA achieves competitive performance on multilingual benchmarks compared to Transformer-based models.

Conclusion: Mamba shows promise as a scalable, efficient, and accurate backbone for multilingual ASR.

Abstract: Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains a challenging task,

Recent advances in sequence modeling suggest that architectures beyond
Transformers may offer better scalability and efficiency. In this work, we
introduce MLMA (Multilingual Language Modeling with Mamba for ASR), a new
approach that leverages the Mamba architecture -- an efficient state-space
model optimized for long-context sequence processing -- for multilingual ASR.
Using Mamba, MLMA implicitly incorporates language-aware conditioning and
shared representations to support robust recognition across diverse languages.
Experiments on standard multilingual benchmarks show that MLMA achieves
competitive performance compared to Transformer-based architectures. These
results highlight Mamba's potential as a strong backbone for scalable,

*Enes Yavuz Ugan,Ngoc-Quan Pham,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Bayesian factorized adapters for adapting large speech foundation models to local needs like code-switching, minimizing adaptation loss and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large speech models need adaptation for local tasks (e.g., code-switching), but direct fine-tuning risks overfitting and losing general capabilities.

Method: Bayesian factorized adapters with priors near zero create sparser adaptation matrices, applied to Whisper for multilingual code-switching.

Result: Minimal adaptation loss and reduced catastrophic forgetting (54% backward gain, 4% drop on new domain) compared to LoRA.

Conclusion: Bayesian adaptation effectively fine-tunes speech models without sacrificing generalization.

Abstract: Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many
domains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as
code-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct
fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and
overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this
challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation
models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and
thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply
our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual
code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while
significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to
LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new
domain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for
fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization.

*Enes Yavuz Ugan,Ngoc-Quan Pham,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge foundational models face with code-switching by introducing labeled training and localized error analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models perform poorly on code-switching due to subtle language shifts, not data scarcity.

Method: Using labels to highlight code-switching points and leveraging language differences to improve learning.

Result: Models showed better prediction of switching points and reduced substitution errors in Arabic and Chinese-English.

Conclusion: Targeted training on code-switching points enhances model robustness against context bias.

Abstract: Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large
foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data
scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the
reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the
embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the
models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to
provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on
code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points
where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis
emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,
we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to
highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those
locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context
bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby
improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and
Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places
more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA, semi-supervised inference-efficient methods for fine-tuning large multilingual models, particularly benefiting low-resource languages like Irish translation. These methods outperform traditional fine-tuning and PEFT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of fine-tuning large multilingual models for low-resource domains like Irish translation, making high-quality domain adaptation more accessible.

Method: Introduces SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA, semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA outperform full-domain fine-tuning and traditional PEFT methods, especially on larger and noisier corpora.

Conclusion: The methods enhance domain adaptation and fine-tuning accessibility for low-resource languages, with open-source Irish translation models provided.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is widely used to tailor large language models for specific tasks
such as neural machine translation (NMT). However, leveraging transfer learning
is computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with
billions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers
working on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original
model parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing
small, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as
semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain
adaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that
SemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA
can propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We
further evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our
embedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier
corpora. All Irish translation models developed in this work are released as
open resources. These methods aim to make high-quality domain adaptation and
fine-tuning more accessible to researchers working with low-resource languages.

TL;DR: Summary: The paper introduces RLAAR, a framework using curriculum reinforcement learning to improve LLMs' performance in multi-turn conversations by balancing correct answers and informed abstention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation: Addresses Lost-in-Conversation (LiC) degradation in LLMs by leveraging reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to enhance reliability in multi-turn settings.

Method: Method: Employs a competence-gated curriculum, on-policy rollouts, and a mixed-reward system to train models for solvability judgment and abstention.

Result: Result: RLAAR reduces LiC decay (62.6% to 75.1%) and boosts abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%).

Conclusion: Conclusion: Provides a practical approach for developing reliable multi-turn LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn
instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation
in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings.
Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not
only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of
questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a
competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty
(in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting
reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system,
RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention,
reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC
benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to
75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together,
these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and
trustworthy LLMs.

*Taha Binhuraib,Greta Tuckute,Nicholas Blauch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Topoformers," Transformers with topographic organization, using spatial querying and reweighting to create interpretable representations aligned with brain-like spatial organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between disorganized machine learning representations and the spatially organized representations in biological brains, enabling better interpretability and alignment with human brain activity.

Method: Proposes spatial querying (2D grid arrangement of keys/queries with local pools) and spatial reweighting (converting fully connected self-attention to locally connected layers). Tested on sentiment classification and BERT for NLP tasks.

Result: Topoformers perform comparably to non-topographic models on NLP benchmarks and exhibit interpretable topographic organization, aligning with human brain responses in fMRI data.

Conclusion: Topoformers enhance interpretability in NLP and model linguistic organization similarly to the human brain, promising future advancements.

Abstract: Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons
are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at
multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning
models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces
that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of
self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic
organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are
arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given
key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected
layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate
the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment
classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic
organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately
encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.
We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with
a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant
performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet
produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight
linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain
responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment
between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and
human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for
greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the
organization of linguistic information in the human brain.

*Jenna Russell,Marzena Karpinska,Destiny Akinode,Katherine Thai,Bradley Emi,Max Spero,Mohit Iyyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study auditing 186K American newspaper articles from 2025 found that 9% were partially or fully AI-generated, with uneven distribution and rare disclosures, emphasizing the need for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the extent and disclosure of AI use in published newspaper articles, addressing gaps in understanding its impact on journalism.

Method: Analyzed a large-scale dataset of 186K articles using Pangram, an AI detector, and conducted manual audits of AI-flagged content.

Result: 9% of articles were AI-generated, with higher prevalence in local outlets, specific topics, and opinion pieces (6.4 times more likely). Only 5 out of 100 AI-flagged articles disclosed AI use.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the urgent need for transparency and updated editorial standards in AI use within journalism to preserve public trust.

Abstract: AI is rapidly transforming journalism, but the extent of its use in published
newspaper articles remains unclear. We address this gap by auditing a
large-scale dataset of 186K articles from online editions of 1.5K American
newspapers published in the summer of 2025. Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art
AI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are
either partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed,
appearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as
weather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze
45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street
Journal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated
content than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged
op-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find
that AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles
found only five disclosures of AI use. Overall, our audit highlights the
immediate need for greater transparency and updated editorial standards
regarding the use of AI in journalism to maintain public trust.

TL;DR: KAT-Coder is a multi-stage trained agentic code model addressing the gap between static training and dynamic execution, achieving robust coding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution in coding.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum involving Mid-Term Training, SFT, RFT, and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation.

Result: Achieves robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning.

Conclusion: KAT-Coder forms a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents, with the 32B model KAT-Dev open-sourced.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in
agentic coding, where models autonomously reason, plan, and act within
interactive software development workflows. However, bridging the gap between
static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a
core challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale
agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing
Mid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances
reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real
software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions. The SFT stage
constructs a million-sample dataset balancing twenty programming languages, ten
development contexts, and ten task archetypes. The RFT stage introduces a novel
multi-ground-truth reward formulation for stable and sample-efficient policy
optimization. Finally, the Reinforcement-to-Deployment phase adapts the model
to production-grade IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured
Trajectory Training. In summary, these stages enable KAT-Coder to achieve
robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning,
forming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents. Our
KAT series 32B model, KAT-Dev, has been open-sourced on

TL;DR: WebSeer is a reinforcement learning-based search agent enhanced with self-reflection, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmarks like HotpotQA and SimpleQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods for search agents suffer from shallow tool-use depth and error accumulation, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic retrieval tasks.

Method: WebSeer introduces a self-reflection mechanism, leveraging a large annotated dataset and a two-stage training framework combining cold start and reinforcement learning.

Result: The model achieves 72.3% accuracy on HotpotQA and 90.0% on SimpleQA, with improved generalization to out-of-distribution datasets.

Conclusion: WebSeer advances search agent capabilities by extending tool-use chains and enhancing accuracy through self-reflection.

Abstract: Search agents have achieved significant advancements in enabling intelligent
information retrieval and decision-making within interactive environments.
Although reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models
capable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by
shallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative
interactions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search
agent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection
mechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection
patterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and
reinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world
web-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more
reflective tool-use trajectories. Our approach substantially extends tool-use
chains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and
90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-distribution datasets. The code is available at

*Shuxin Lin,Dhaval Patel,Christodoulos Constantinides*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation to transfer reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Small Language Models (SLMs) for industrial asset health applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are efficient and cost-effective but struggle with complex reasoning in specialized fields like Industry 4.0.

Method: The framework uses CoT distillation with multi-choice question answering prompts and in-context learning to verify knowledge quality.

Result: Fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform base models and narrow the performance gap with LLMs.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reasoning in SLMs for specialized tasks, making them viable alternatives to LLMs.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized
fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower
computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific
tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing
complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains
challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for
industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to
smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the
process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts
to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context
learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the
performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used
LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform
the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM
counterparts. Our code is open-sourced at:

*Wenxuan Li,Chengruidong Zhang,Huiqiang Jiang,Yucheng Li,Yuqing Yang,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTraining is a distributed methodology for efficiently training LLMs with ultra-long contexts using dynamic sparse attention, addressing computational imbalance and communication overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of worker- and step-level imbalance in distributed training of LLMs with dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts.

Method: MTraining integrates dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention, and hierarchical sparse ring attention to optimize training efficiency.

Result: Successful expansion of Qwen2.5-3B's context window from 32K to 512K tokens on 32 A100 GPUs, achieving up to 6x higher training throughput without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: MTraining effectively enhances the scalability and efficiency of LLM training with ultra-long contexts.

Abstract: The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large
Language Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their
capacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse
scenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the
computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with
dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed
settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and
step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed
methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training
for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key
components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,
and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to
synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads
inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models
with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by
training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K
tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite
of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A
Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput
while preserving model accuracy. Our code is available at

*Chenghao Zhu,Meiling Tao,Tiannan Wang,Dongyi Ding,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Critique-Post-Edit enhances LLM personalization by combining multi-dimensional reward models and post-editing, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SFT and RLHF struggle with nuanced personalization and reward hacking.

Method: Critique-Post-Edit integrates a Personalized GRM and a post-edit mechanism for targeted learning.

Result: Significant improvements (11% win-rate) and outperforming GPT-4.1 with larger models.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical, faithful, and controllable personalization for LLMs.

Abstract: Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the
nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward
hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To
address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust
reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable
personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a
Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional
scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a
Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs
based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a
rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms
standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an
average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses
the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to
faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

*Akshat Gupta,Jay Yeung,Gopala Anumanchipalli,Anna Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) use their depth unevenly during inference, proposing a 'Guess-then-Refine' framework to explain their layer-wise prediction dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nuanced and structured way LLMs utilize their depth during predictions, addressing gaps in fine-grained insights into their intermediate representations.

Method: Traces intermediate representations of open-weight LLMs during inference, analyzing token frequency, part-of-speech, fact recall, and multiple-choice tasks to reveal layer-wise computational dynamics.

Result: Early layers predict high-frequency tokens as guesses, refined deeper into the model. Function words are predicted earliest, and task-specific dynamics (e.g., fact recall, multiple-choice) show varied depth usage.

Conclusion: The study offers detailed insights into LLMs' depth usage, highlighting layer-by-layer computations and suggesting avenues for improving computational efficiency in transformer models.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth
uniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise
prediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations
of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and
nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" framework
that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make
predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers
are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical
guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate
contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the
model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.
Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the
time, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We then
go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer
depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that
function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)
Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token
requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task
analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the
first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.
Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding
light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions
and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in
transformer-based models.

*Zongze Wu,Yani Guo,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRETEL improves tool retrieval for agent-based systems by validating tools through sandboxed execution cycles, overcoming the semantic-functional gap and boosting performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool retrieval methods rely on semantic similarity, often resulting in functionally inoperative tools due to mismatches.

Method: GRETEL uses an agentic workflow with sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles to validate tool functionality.

Result: GRETEL significantly improves Pass Rate, Recall, and NDCG metrics on the ToolBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Execution-based validation outperforms semantic similarity for reliable tool selection, enhancing agent performance.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: CARLE is a hybrid AI framework combining deep and shallow learning for robust Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction in Prognostic Health Management (PHM). It outperforms state-of-the-art methods under dynamic conditions and emphasizes interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RUL methods lack generalizability and robustness under changing operating conditions, prompting the development of CARLE.

Method: CARLE integrates Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention, residual connections, and a Random Forest Regressor (RFR). Preprocessing includes Gaussian filtering and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT).

Result: CARLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA datasets, particularly under dynamic conditions. Ablation studies confirm component contributions, and robustness tests validate its performance.

Conclusion: CARLE demonstrates superior RUL prediction accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, making it a promising solution for PHM systems.

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address parameter conflicts in model merging that degrade performance on domain-specific tasks.

Method: Proposes MIN-Merging, a router-based framework for selectively merging important neurons.

Result: Achieves consistent gains on in-domain tasks and retains generalization on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: MIN-Merging is an effective solution for parameter conflict problems in model merging.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models

their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a

TL;DR: A federated unlearning approach for LLMs addresses challenges of continuous, heterogeneous unlearning needs and decentralized data by decoupling unlearning and retention, ensuring privacy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy and security concerns in LLMs due to undesirable knowledge, focusing on the challenges of continuous unlearning needs and decentralized data.

Method: Uses task-specific adapter learning to decouple unlearning and retention, combined with hierarchical merging to mitigate conflicting objectives.

Result: Effective handling of heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility, outperforming baseline methods on WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU benchmarks.

Conclusion: The federated unlearning approach provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for LLMs, balancing unlearning and retention effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified benchmark for evaluating attention mechanisms in Transformer-based LLMs to address gaps in systematic analysis, focusing on scalability and efficiency for long-context training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attention mechanisms face quadratic computational and memory costs with sequence length, hindering long-context training. Prior solutions lack comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Develops a modular and extensible benchmark integrating attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms, evaluating mask patterns and sequence length scalability.

Result: Benchmark tests on up to 96 GPUs reveal method-specific trade-offs, offering reproducible comparisons and practical deployment insights.

Conclusion: The benchmark fills evaluation gaps, aids in optimizing attention mechanisms, and guides long-context LLM training.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

TL;DR: L-MoE integrates Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into a lightweight, end-to-end trainable framework for efficient and scalable language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the scalability of MoE with the parameter efficiency of LoRA, creating a modular and dynamic model for specialized tasks.

Method: Replace dense MoE experts with task-specialized LoRA adapters and train a lightweight gating network to dynamically compose them.

Result: A highly parameter-efficient, modular MoE model capable of dynamic skill composition and end-to-end training.

Conclusion: L-MoE offers a scalable and efficient framework for building specialized language models.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

### [167] [Automated Algorithm Design for Auto-Tuning Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17899)
*Floris-Jan Willemsen,Niki van Stein,Ben van Werkhoven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to generate tailored optimization algorithms for auto-tuning tasks, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-tuning traditionally relies on generic optimization algorithms, but no single method excels across all tasks. This work explores LLMs as a solution to generate specialized optimizers.

Method: A framework prompts LLMs with problem descriptions and search-space characteristics to produce and iteratively refine optimization strategies.

Result: LLM-generated optimizers outperformed state-of-the-art methods by up to 72.4% across real-world applications and hardware platforms.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively generate high-performance optimizers for auto-tuning, offering a promising alternative to human-designed algorithms.

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning (SBVFL) reduces communication by 99% compared to standard VFL while maintaining accuracy and robustness, enabling practical, privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) faces challenges like high communication costs compromising privacy, security, and energy efficiency. SBVFL aims to address these limitations.

Method: SBVFL introduces a distributed training mechanism that decouples most node updates from the server, reducing node-server communication.

Result: Experiments show SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while maintaining accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: SBVFL enables practical, privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

Conclusion: NeuCo-Bench offers a standardized, reproducible approach for evaluating neural embeddings in EO and other domains.

Abstract: We introduce NeuCo-Bench, a novel benchmark framework for evaluating (lossy)
neural compression and representation learning in the context of Earth
Observation (EO). Our approach builds on fixed-size embeddings that act as
compact, task-agnostic representations applicable to a broad range of
downstream tasks. NeuCo-Bench comprises three core components: (i) an
evaluation pipeline built around reusable embeddings, (ii) a new challenge mode
with a hidden-task leaderboard designed to mitigate pretraining bias, and (iii)
a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support
reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral,
multitemporal EO dataset. We present initial results from a public challenge at
the 2025 CVPR EARTHVISION workshop and conduct ablations with state-of-the-art
foundation models. NeuCo-Bench provides a first step towards community-driven,
standardized evaluation of neural embeddings for EO and beyond.

*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-hoc calibration framework improves calibration and uncertainty-aware decision-making by assessing prediction reliability and applying dual calibration strategies based on prediction correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration methods treat predictions uniformly, ignoring heterogeneous reliability, and the link between calibration and decision-making is understudied.

Method: Uses proximity-based conformal prediction to group predictions by correctness, applying isotonic regression for correct predictions and underconfidence-regularized isotonic for incorrect ones.

Result: Achieves fewer confidently incorrect predictions and competitive calibration error on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones.

Conclusion: The framework bridges calibration and uncertainty quantification, improving probability alignment and decision-making without model retraining.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

### [171] [Data Unlearning Beyond Uniform Forgetting via Diffusion Time and Frequency Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17917)
*Jinseong Park,Mijung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores data unlearning in diffusion models, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and proposing a time-frequency selective approach to improve unlearning quality and aesthetic generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data unlearning methods in diffusion models often degrade quality or fail to fully forget samples. The authors aim to address these issues by focusing on selective time-frequency ranges.

Method: The authors introduce a time-frequency selective approach during training, applied to gradient-based and preference optimization objectives, as well as image-level and text-to-image tasks. They also propose a normalized SSCD metric for evaluation.

Result: The method improves aesthetic quality and reduces noise in generated samples compared to existing approaches, validated across diverse settings.

Conclusion: The study clarifies challenges in data unlearning for diffusion models and offers practical strategies to enhance both evaluation and unlearning performance.

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

*Chenwei Tang,Jingyu Xing,Xinyu Liu,Wei Ju,Jiancheng Lv,Deng Xiong,Ziyue Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COMPASS introduces a novel test-time reward mechanism for RL on unlabeled data, combining confidence-calibrated pseudo-labels and reasoning path optimization to enhance LLMs' analytical capabilities without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs rely heavily on human-curated preference data, limiting scalability. COMPASS aims to enable autonomous learning from unlabeled experience streams by addressing unreliable reward estimation.

Method: COMPASS integrates two components: Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR) for stable pseudo-labels and Decisive Path Reward (DPR) for optimizing reasoning quality. It avoids reliance on external supervision.

Result: Experiments demonstrate COMPASS achieves consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, validating its scalability.

Conclusion: COMPASS advances RL for LLMs by enabling reliable autonomous learning from unlabeled data, overcoming scalability bottlenecks in existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evolutionary, task-agnostic framework for synthesizing verifiable data, improving generalization and performance in language models across tasks like math, coding, and agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for synthetic verifiable data struggle with hallucination and weak verification, lacking domain-agnostic principles.

Method: Proposes a synthesis framework combining evolutionary strategies, executable checks, and iterative refinement via consistency-based evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements on LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks under RLVR and distillation paradigms.

Conclusion: The framework reliably synthesizes verifiable data, generalizing without domain-specific rules and enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Param--CPD detects regime shifts in chaotic systems by analyzing parameter trajectories, outperforming observation-space methods in accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is challenging due to intrinsic variability masking signals in observation space.

Method: Param--CPD uses simulation-based inference with a neural posterior estimator to infer parameters, then applies changepoint detection to the parameter trajectory.

Result: Param--CPD improves F1 score, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation-space methods, demonstrating robustness across various conditions.

Conclusion: Parameter-space analysis provides clearer signals for changepoint detection in nonlinear systems, enhancing accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

*Jaihoon Kim,Rajarshi Saha,Minhyuk Sung,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transition Matching (TM) outperforms Flow Matching (FM) in generative models when target distributions are unimodal Gaussian or well-separated Gaussian mixtures, due to better covariance preservation and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work explores when and why TM surpasses FM in generative models, addressing gaps in understanding their comparative performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis proves TM's lower KL divergence and faster convergence for unimodal Gaussians. Extended to Gaussian mixtures, focusing on local-unimodality regimes.

Result: TM excels with well-separated modes and non-negligible variances, validated by experiments on Gaussians and real-world image/video generation.

Conclusion: TM is superior to FM under specific conditions, notably for well-separated multimodal distributions, but loses advantage as variance diminishes.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep subspace clustering models address complex spatiotemporal data but have limitations like ignoring local structure and long-range dependencies. A-DATSC improves this with attention-guided adversarial learning and achieves superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep subspace clustering models struggle with local structure, long-range dependencies, and 4D spatiotemporal data, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: A-DATSC combines a deep subspace clustering generator (inspired by U-Net) with a discriminator, using ConvLSTM2D layers and a graph attention transformer for spatial and temporal integrity.

Result: A-DATSC outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets.

Conclusion: A-DATSC addresses key limitations of existing models, offering enhanced clustering performance for complex spatiotemporal data.

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between deep learning advancements and neural activity forecasting, enabling better understanding and control of neural systems.

Method: Systematic evaluation of eight probabilistic deep learning models, including foundation models, compared to four classical statistical models and two baselines on mouse cortex data.

Result: Deep learning models consistently outperformed classical methods, with the best model forecasting up to 1.5 seconds ahead.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows promise for neural activity forecasting, opening avenues for control applications and temporal structure exploration.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

TL;DR: STONe introduces a non-autoregressive neural operator for cross-domain forecasting, proving stability and accuracy without domain alignment or autoregressive steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor data, which existing methods fail due to dense input assumptions.

Method: Develops STONe, a neural operator learning stable functional mappings between heterogeneous domains, tested on high-altitude radiation from ground neutron data.

Result: Achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with millisecond latency, demonstrating generalization beyond shared-domain settings.

Conclusion: STONe establishes a general framework for real-time cross-domain inference in complex spatiotemporal systems.

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

TL;DR: ACIA introduces a measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning, addressing challenges like high-dimensional data and imperfect interventions, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the unique challenges of anti-causal representation learning, where labels cause features, by developing a framework that ensures robustness and generalization across environments.

Method: ACIA uses a two-level design: low-level representations capture label-generated observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal patterns. It incorporates interventional kernels and avoids dependency on explicit causal structures.

Result: ACIA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthetic and real-world medical datasets, achieving better accuracy and invariance. Theoretical guarantees confirm robust generalization.

Conclusion: ACIA provides a effective solution for anti-causal learning, with proven theoretical bounds and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADRPO adaptively adjusts divergence regularization in reinforcement learning fine-tuning for generative models, balancing exploration and exploitation based on data quality, outperforming fixed regularization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning fine-tuning of generative models, as fixed regularization either limits reward optimization or risks instability.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which dynamically adjusts regularization strength using advantage estimates, applying weaker regularization to high-value samples and stronger to poor ones.

Result: ADRPO achieves superior performance in text-to-image generation, surpassing larger models in attribute binding, semantic consistency, and diversity. It also excels in LLM fine-tuning and multi-modal reasoning, outperforming commercial models.

Conclusion: ADRPO provides an effective plug-and-play solution for the exploration-exploitation challenge across various generative architectures and modalities, enhancing existing RL methods.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

TL;DR: SPACeR combines RL self-play with a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model to create human-like, scalable AV policies, achieving competitive performance with faster inference and smaller size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop AV policies that are realistic, socially aware, and computationally efficient, addressing limitations of current imitation learning and RL methods.

Method: SPACeR integrates a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a reference policy to guide decentralized RL self-play, using likelihood rewards and KL divergence.

Result: SPACeR achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies, while being 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a scalable paradigm for testing AV policies, balancing human-like behavior and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

*Jiajun Fan,Chaoran Cheng,Shuaike Shen,Xiangxin Zhou,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-Flow introduces a robust actor-critic framework to fine-tune flow-based generative models with intermediate feedback, addressing challenges like credit assignment and training instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with credit assignment and instability in fine-tuning flow models with intermediate feedback.

Method: AC-Flow employs reward shaping, dual-stability mechanisms (advantage clipping and critic warm-up), and scalable critic weighting with Wasserstein regularization.

Result: AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image alignment and generalization, maintaining generative quality and diversity.

Conclusion: AC-Flow enables stable and effective fine-tuning of flow models without compromising performance or stability.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

*Nadir Farhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at maximizing the probability of exceeding a performance threshold, addressing reliability needs in stochastic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world RL applications require guaranteed performance probabilities, not just high average returns, motivating the development of reliable RL strategies.

Method: The authors reformulate the reliable RL problem into a standard RL problem using state augmentation, enabling the use of existing algorithms like Q-learning and Dueling Double DQN.

Result: Theoretical equivalence between formulations is proven, and practical experiments (e.g., reliable routing) show policies balancing efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: The reliable RL approach effectively addresses stochastic and safety-critical applications, demonstrating its practical relevance and adaptability.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new experimental database for training ML-based anomaly detection in chemical processes, addressing the lack of open data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML-based anomaly detection methods in chemical processes are limited by scarce open experimental data.

Method: A lab-scale batch distillation plant was operated to generate data, including fault-free and anomaly-induced experiments, with diverse sensors and unconventional data sources like NMR and audio/video.

Result: A structured, freely available database of 119 experiments was created, including metadata, expert annotations, and anomaly ontology.

Conclusion: The database supports advanced ML-based anomaly detection and interpretable methods, enabling future research.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

Motivation: Study aims to model large-scale brain dynamics more effectively than traditional methods, leveraging deep learning advances for neuroscience applications.

Method: Introduces MEG-GPT, a transformer-based foundation model with time-attention and next time-point prediction, plus a novel data-driven tokenizer for continuous MEG data. Trained on a large MEG dataset (N=612).

Result: Model generates realistic spatio-spectral data and improves downstream decoding tasks, showing better zero-shot generalization across sessions and subjects compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MEG-GPT establishes a powerful foundation model for electrophysiological data, with potential applications in computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

*Jiawei Zhang,Andrew Estornell,David D. Baek,Bo Li,Xiaojun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADA is an inference-time defense method that reinforces LLM safety by reintroducing alignment tokens mid-generation, achieving robust refusal rates against adversarial attacks without modifying model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit shallow alignment, failing to maintain safety beyond initial refusals. ADA addresses this by leveraging innate alignment priors in assistant header tokens.

Method: ADA reintroduces alignment-concentrated assistant header tokens mid-stream to reassess harmfulness, enabling refusals at any generation depth.

Result: ADA achieves near-100% refusal rates against adversarial attacks and reduces success rates of prompt attacks to below 3%, with minimal impact on benign tasks.

Conclusion: ADA effectively unlocks LLMs' shallow alignment for deeper safety, proving resilient even post-instruction tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

### [188] [Provably Optimal Reinforcement Learning under Safety Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18082)
*Donggeon David Oh,Duy P. Nguyen,Haimin Hu,Jaime F. Fisac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safety filters in reinforcement learning can ensure safety without degrading asymptotic performance, challenging the perceived safety-performance tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of formal safety guarantees in RL, particularly in safety-critical settings, and explores whether safety filters inherently hinder performance.

Method: The authors formalize RL safety using a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP) and define a filtered MDP where actions are enforced safe by a filter. They prove theoretical guarantees.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show that using a sufficiently permissive safety filter ensures categorical safety without compromising asymptotic performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that safety enforcement and performance optimization can be separated, advocating for training and deploying RL policies with the most permissive safety filter available.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models combining structured and unstructured data significantly improve ICU mortality prediction, achieving an AUC of 0.918.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate early prediction of ICU mortality aids timely clinical intervention and resource allocation.

Method: Used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by logistic regression with TF-IDF and BERT embeddings for textual data.

Result: Final model achieved an AUC of 0.918 (22% improvement over structured data alone) with strong clinical utility.

Conclusion: Unstructured clinical notes add prognostic value and should be integrated into ICU risk prediction models.

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

TL;DR: LDDMs combine discrete and continuous diffusion for improved joint structure and generation quality in few-step scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of masked denoisers, which weaken joint structure due to factorized reverse transitions.

Method: Introduces Latent Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) coupling masked discrete diffusion with continuous latent diffusion.

Result: LDDMs show improvements in unconditional generation metrics and effectiveness at low sampling budgets.

Conclusion: LDDMs enhance joint structure and performance in few-step diffusion-based generation.

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rectified Flows aim for straight paths between distributions but can fail by memorizing training pairs, especially deterministically. Gradient variance analysis reveals optimization favors memorization, validated on CelebA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Rectified Flows sometimes fail by memorizing training data instead of generalizing, even when interpolant paths intersect.

Method: Study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport, analyze gradient variance, and test on CelebA with deterministic vs. noisy training.

Result: Deterministic training leads to memorization; injecting noise restores generalization.

Conclusion: Rectified Flows' straight-path objective can induce memorization; noise during training helps generalization.

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAD improves long-context LLM training by separating core attention computation and executing it on dedicated devices, addressing load imbalance and stragglers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems suffer from load imbalance due to core attention's quadratic compute growth at long context lengths.

Method: CAD partitions core attention into token-level tasks dispatched to attention servers, dynamically rebatching for efficiency.

Result: Implemented in DistCA, CAD boosts throughput by up to 1.35x and achieves near-perfect compute/memory balance.

Conclusion: CAD effectively addresses load imbalance in long-context training, enhancing efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

TL;DR: HyDiF models 3D molecular conformers as continuous fields using Molecular Directional Fields (MDFs), represented by neural implicit fields. A hypernetwork generates these fields, trained as a diffusion model for generative tasks and scalable to large biomolecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a continuous and localized representation of 3D molecular structures for improved generation and property prediction, overcoming limitations of discrete atomic coordinates or graphs.

Method: HyDiF uses Molecular Neural Fields (MNFs) to represent MDFs, generated by a hypernetwork conditioned on molecules. It employs diffusion models for generative tasks and supports masked diffusion for structure-conditioned generation.

Result: The framework enables fine-grained molecular feature extraction, supports scalable modeling of biomolecules, and facilitates tasks like molecular inpainting.

Conclusion: HyDiF presents a promising direction for field-based molecular modeling, offering advantages in generation, property prediction, and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Result: Demonstrates kernelizability, out-of-sample applicability, and introduces new algorithms with empirical comparisons. Uncovers optimization insights linking simultaneous iteration to DCA.

Conclusion: The work advances PCA understanding by integrating optimization perspectives, proposing new methods, and validating them empirically.

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and
(kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of
PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), a method for finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games, which avoids unstable learning by fixing regularization strength and iteratively refining policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regularization-based methods for Nash equilibria require shrinking regularization strength, leading to instability. The aim is to achieve robust convergence without this drawback.

Method: The approach fixes regularization strength for robustness and iteratively refines the reference policy. NashPG, a practical algorithm, leverages policy gradient methods without uniqueness assumptions.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show monotonic improvement and exact Nash equilibrium convergence in two-player zero-sum games. Empirically, NashPG outperforms prior methods in exploitability and scalability.

Conclusion: NashPG provides a stable and scalable solution for Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games, validated by both theory and empirical results.

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActivationReasoning (AR) embeds logical reasoning into LLMs' latent space, improving interpretability and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparent internal reasoning and controllable latent features.

Method: AR identifies latent concepts, maps them to propositions, and applies logical rules.

Result: AR enhances reasoning, control, and alignment across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: AR makes LLMs more reliable and auditable by grounding logical structure.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

*Jostein Barry-Straume,Adwait D. Verulkar,Arash Sarshar,Andrey A. Popov,Adrian Sandu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multistage ensemble framework is introduced to learn optimal control signals via the HJB equation, avoiding stabilizer terms used in prior PINN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solutions to the HJB equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are often unavailable, prompting the use of knowledge-guided machine learning like PINNs.

Method: The proposed framework learns the optimal cost-to-go and control signal through the HJB equation without stabilizer terms, offering singular or ensemble control policies.

Result: The method successfully controls a nonlinear system under noisy conditions and varying initial states, using both ensemble and singular control approaches.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective alternative to traditional HJB solutions, demonstrating robustness in controlling nonlinear systems.

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

*Xueyao Zhang,Bo Yang,Zhiwen Yu,Xuelin Cao,Wei Xiang,Bin Guo,Liang Wang,Billy Pik Lik Lau,George C. Alexandropoulos,Jun Luo,Mérouane Debbah,Zhu Han,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores efficient and covert underwater target detection using AUVs by optimizing trajectory and power control through a hierarchical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the trade-off between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness in underwater target detection using AUVs.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical action management framework combining a macro-level Markov decision process for task allocation and a micro-level partially observable MDP for decentralized decision-making.

Result: The framework enables adaptive covert cooperation under energy and mobility constraints, offering theoretical and practical insights.

Conclusion: The approach provides efficient and secure solutions for underwater covert communication tasks using multiple AUVs.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

### [199] [Towards Fast LLM Fine-tuning through Zeroth-Order Optimization with Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18228)
*Zhendong Mi,Qitao Tan,Grace Li Zhang,Zhaozhuo Xu,Geng Yuan,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P-GAP, a zeroth-order optimization method for fine-tuning LLMs, reduces gradient estimation variance by projecting gradient-aligned perturbations, leading to faster convergence and better performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zeroth-order methods for LLM fine-tuning suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, causing slow convergence and suboptimal performance. P-GAP addresses this issue.

Method: P-GAP estimates a low-dimensional gradient space and aligns perturbations along projected gradients' direction, reducing perturbed parameters and variance.

Result: P-GAP outperforms baselines, achieving up to 6% higher accuracy in classification and 12% in generation tasks, with 81% fewer iterations and 70% less GPU time.

Conclusion: P-GAP enables efficient, scalable, and resource-effective zeroth-order fine-tuning for large language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

*Yuzheng Hu,Ryan McKenna,Da Yu,Shanshan Wu,Han Zhao,Zheng Xu,Peter Kairouz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACTG-ARL improves DP synthetic text quality and control via hierarchical framework and anchored RL, achieving +20% MAUVE over prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generate high-quality DP synthetic text while preserving privacy and statistical attributes, addressing prior failures in utility and control.

Method: Hierarchical framework (ACTG) with feature learning and conditional generation, plus Anchored RL (ARL) for post-training improvement.

Result: +20% MAUVE score over prior work, better control under strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL effectively addresses challenges in DP synthetic text generation, offering improved quality and fine-grained control.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

*Bryan Wilder,Angela Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current AI/ML research criteria favor projects combining deployment and methodological novelty, potentially harming sustainability. Authors advocate for broader impact definitions and rigorous evaluation of deployed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight how current review criteria may undermine sustainable social impact research by favoring dual contributions over single-front advancements tailored to partner needs.

Method: The authors present a position paper arguing for changes in how social impact is conceptualized and evaluated in AI/ML research.

Result: The paper identifies a gap in current review practices and proposes alternative approaches to better support diverse contributions.

Conclusion: Researchers and reviewers should adopt broader definitions of social impact and more rigorous evaluations of deployed systems to sustain a diverse research ecosystem.

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

### [202] [Learning with Dual-level Noisy Correspondence for Multi-modal Entity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18240)
*Haobin Li,Yijie Lin,Peng Hu,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RULE, a framework addressing Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC) in multi-modal entity alignment by estimating correspondence reliability and mitigating noise impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume flawless correspondences, but real-world MMKGs often have noisy intra-entity and inter-graph alignments due to expert annotations.

Method: RULE estimates correspondence reliability via a two-fold principle, mitigates intra-entity noise during attribute fusion, prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences, and includes a correspondence reasoning module.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show RULE outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in handling DNC.

Conclusion: RULE effectively addresses DNC by combining reliability estimation, noise mitigation, and correspondence reasoning, proving robust in noisy MMKG environments.

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

*Song Bian,Tao Yu,Shivaram Venkataraman,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how architectural factors like hidden size, mlp-to-attention ratio, and grouped-query attention influence inference cost and accuracy in LLMs. It introduces a conditional scaling law and search framework to optimize these trade-offs, validating results with over 200 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs grow more powerful, inference costs become a concern, but the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency is underexplored.

Method: The study examines architectural factors, proposes a conditional scaling law, and uses a search framework to identify efficient and accurate models. Over 200 models are trained for validation.

Result: The conditional scaling law reliably predicts optimal architectures, yielding models with up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater throughput than LLaMA-3.2.

Conclusion: Optimizing architectural choices using the proposed framework enhances both inference efficiency and model accuracy.

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NTKMTL leverages Neural Tangent Kernel theory to balance task convergence speeds in Multi-Task Learning, addressing task imbalance effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task imbalance in Multi-Task Learning hinders performance, requiring innovative methods to balance task convergence speeds.

Method: Uses an extended NTK matrix and spectral analysis to balance task convergence, proposing NTKMTL-SR for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-task supervised and reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: NTKMTL and NTKMTL-SR effectively mitigate task imbalance, enhancing MTL performance.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Customized-GRPO improves subject-driven image generation by addressing conflicts in reward signals and aligning optimization with temporal dynamics, outperforming naive GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between identity preservation and prompt adherence in image generation models, avoiding competitive degradation caused by naive GRPO.

Method: Introduces Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS) for non-linear reward handling and Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW) for alignment with diffusion dynamics.

Result: Customized-GRPO outperforms baselines, achieving better balance between identity preservation and prompt adherence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates competitive degradation and enhances image generation quality.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

TL;DR: TOT framework improves online time-series forecasting by integrating latent variables, offering theoretical guarantees and real-world effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unknown distribution shifts in time-series forecasting by leveraging latent variables for better prediction accuracy.

Method: Proposes TOT framework with latent variables, uses temporal decoders and noise estimators for causal inference and mixing procedures.

Result: Theoretical benefits confirmed; plug-in implementations enhance baseline performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: TOT framework provides a robust, model-agnostic solution for improved online time-series forecasting.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

*Hao Qin,Thang Duong,Ming Li,Chicheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two physics-informed bandit algorithms, 'pretc' and 'prgreedy,' for efficient beam alignment in mmWave communications, outperforming existing methods by leveraging the sparse multipath property of mmWave channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bandit algorithms for beam alignment rely on unrealistic assumptions about reward functions, leading to suboptimal performance. The authors aim to address this by exploiting the sparse multipath property of mmWave channels, a more realistic assumption.

Method: The authors introduce 'pretc,' which involves random exploration followed by committing to the optimal beam, and 'prgreedy,' which updates beam choices online based on current estimates. Both algorithms treat path parameters as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates.

Result: Experiments on synthetic (DeepMIMO) and real-world (DeepSense6G) datasets show that both algorithms outperform existing methods in diverse channel environments, demonstrating generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms provide efficient and robust solutions for beam alignment and tracking in mmWave communications by leveraging realistic assumptions about channel properties.

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

TL;DR: CHiLD framework uniquely identifies hierarchical latent dynamics using three conditionally independent observations, leveraging temporal context and sparsity for accurate modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture hierarchical latent dynamics due to inability to recover joint distributions from single-timestep observations.

Method: Uses temporal context observations to identify multi-layer latent distributions, employs sparsity for layer-wise identification, and integrates variational inference with contextual encoders and flow-based priors.

Result: Empirical tests on synthetic and real-world data confirm CHiLD's effectiveness in modeling hierarchical latent dynamics.

Conclusion: CHiLD successfully addresses limitations of existing methods, providing a robust framework for hierarchical latent dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

*Brady Bhalla,Honglu Fan,Nancy Chen,Tony Yue YU*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how embedding dimensions impact internal world models in transformers trained with RL for bubble-sort tasks, showing larger dimensions improve representation quality and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between embedding dimensions and the formation of structured internal representations in transformers performing algorithmic tasks.

Method: Training transformers with reinforcement learning on bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps, varying embedding dimensions, and analyzing attention mechanisms.

Result: Higher embedding dimensions yield more faithful and robust internal representations, with structured mechanisms emerging consistently.

Conclusion: Larger embedding dimensions enhance representation quality and interpretability, supporting the idea that transformers build structured internal world models.

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flexible Evidential Deep Learning (F-EDL) to improve uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning by generalizing the Dirichlet distribution assumption, enhancing adaptability and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is critical for high-stakes ML applications to avoid overconfident predictions. Existing EDL methods are limited by their restrictive Dirichlet assumption, prompting the need for a more flexible approach.

Method: The paper proposes F-EDL, which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities, offering a more expressive uncertainty representation.

Result: F-EDL achieves state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse scenarios, including classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution settings.

Conclusion: F-EDL provides a more robust and adaptable framework for uncertainty quantification, addressing limitations of traditional EDL methods.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TCCM is a new semi-supervised anomaly detection method for tabular data, inspired by flow matching but simplified for efficiency and scalability. It avoids solving ODEs, offers fast scoring, and provides explainability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods like diffusion models are computationally expensive. TCCM aims to simplify flow matching for better efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: TCCM learns time-conditioned contraction vectors toward the origin, removing the need for ODE solving. It uses a one time-step deviation scoring strategy for fast inference.

Result: TCCM achieves superior accuracy and efficiency on high-dimensional datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like DTE.

Conclusion: TCCM balances accuracy and cost effectively, offering a practical solution for anomaly detection in tabular data.

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theory assumes γ<1, but recent RL for large language models uses γ=1, requiring new analysis.

Method: Classifies MDP states into recurrent/transient and introduces transient visitation measure.

Conclusion: The analysis bridges the gap between theory and practice for γ=1 scenarios.

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

*Dariusz Kalociński,Tomasz Steifer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines computable universal online learning in binary classification, showing it's not always possible even with simple hypothesis classes, and provides exact characterizations for agnostic and proper learning variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between abstract learning theory and practical implementation by addressing when universal online learning can be realized as a computer program.

Method: The researchers analyze universal online learning under computability constraints, differentiating between agnostic and proper learning variants, and provide exact characterizations for each.

Result: They demonstrate that universal online learning doesn't guarantee computable implementation, even for simple hypothesis classes, and characterize agnostic and proper learning scenarios precisely.

Conclusion: The findings offer a more realistic view of online binary classification and inductive inference, highlighting limitations and exact conditions for computable learning.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

*Firas Gabetni,Giuseppe Curci,Andrea Pilzer,Subhankar Roy,Elisa Ricci,Gianni Franchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra Ensembles introduces an efficient transformer-based method for uncertainty quantification, reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving performance compared to Deep Ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational and memory costs of Deep Ensembles while maintaining strong uncertainty quantification performance.

Method: Hydra Ensembles prunes attention heads to create diverse members and merges them using grouped fully-connected layers, resulting in a compact model.

Result: The approach matches or surpasses Deep Ensembles in UQ performance, achieves faster inference, and performs well in zero-shot classification without retraining.

Conclusion: Hydra Ensembles offers a scalable and efficient solution for uncertainty quantification, outperforming existing methods in various tasks.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

*Sunwoo Kim,Hyunjin Hwang,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGP is a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that improves performance without specialized structures, achieving up to 106% boost in Precision-1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of deep learning models depends on their neural architecture, but current flow-based encoders are slow due to complex structures.

Method: FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, representing information flow, without needing specialized model structures.

Result: FGP improves encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1% compared to supervised learning alone.

Conclusion: FGP offers a faster, simpler alternative to complex flow-based encoders while enhancing performance.

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

### [216] [Towards Unsupervised Open-Set Graph Domain Adaptation via Dual Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18363)
*Zhen Zhang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphRTA, a framework for unsupervised open-set graph domain adaptation, addressing the challenge of recognizing unknown classes in target graphs by reprogramming graph structure, node features, and model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph domain adaptation models assume shared label spaces between source and target domains, which is impractical. The paper aims to tackle open-set scenarios where target domains may include unseen classes.

Method: Proposes GraphRTA, which involves graph reprogramming (modifying structure and features) and model reprogramming (pruning domain-specific parameters). It also extends the classifier for unknown class recognition without manual thresholds.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show GraphRTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on public datasets.

Conclusion: GraphRTA effectively addresses open-set graph domain adaptation by integrating graph and model reprogramming, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies expert-level diversification techniques for Graph Neural Network (GNN) ensembles, evaluating 20 strategies across 14 benchmarks to improve performance through diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The heterogeneity in real-world graphs limits single GNN performance, prompting exploration of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks to enhance results via diverse GNN ensembles.

Method: The study evaluates 20 diversification strategies (e.g., random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation) across 14 node classification benchmarks, analyzing over 200 ensemble variants.

Result: Findings reveal insights into training diverse experts, emphasizing diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance improvements.

Conclusion: The research offers practical guidance for expert training and MoE framework design on graph data, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

focuses on the dependence of the approximation rate on the dimension and the
smoothness of the function being approximated within the Barron function space.
We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving
that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,ChangChun HUa,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) for weakly supervised learning with NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision, achieving robust performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses weakly supervised learning scenarios where only aggregate signals (tuple counts) are available, aiming to effectively exploit count-only supervision through a theoretically grounded approach.

Method: The authors derive a closed-form URE from fixed tuple sizes and counts, extend it to variable cases, and introduce ReLU corrections for finite-sample stability. They link tuple-generation to latent instance marginals.

Result: The proposed URE outperforms weak-supervision baselines, provides favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs, and remains robust under class-prior imbalance and diverse tuple configurations.

Conclusion: NTMP supervision can be effectively utilized through a theoretically sound and stable objective, demonstrating practical viability in weakly supervised learning.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often overfit due to their high capacity; MAGDrop addresses this by introducing adaptive dropout.

Method: MAGDrop dynamically adjusts dropout rates using current gradients and accumulated momentum, supported by a tightened PAC-Bayes generalization bound.

Result: MAGDrop outperforms baseline methods by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with sharper generalization bounds.

Conclusion: MAGDrop bridges theory and practice, offering a robust regularization framework for improving DNN generalization.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.
Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a

*Christopher von Klitzing,Denis Blessing,Henrik Schopmans,Pascal Friederich,Gerhard Neumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Constrained Mass Transport (CMT), a variational framework to improve sampling from Boltzmann distributions, outperforming existing methods by preventing mode collapse and mass teleportation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from high-dimensional, multimodal Boltzmann distributions is challenging due to issues like mode collapse in classical methods and mass teleportation in annealing-based approaches.

Method: CMT generates intermediate distributions with constraints on KL divergence and entropy decay between steps to enhance overlap and mitigate convergence issues.

Result: CMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 2.5x higher effective sample size on benchmarks and the ELIL tetrapeptide system.

Conclusion: CMT provides a robust solution for sampling Boltzmann distributions, addressing key limitations of existing techniques.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

TL;DR: SE-HTGNN proposes a unified spatio-temporal learning paradigm for heterogeneous temporal graphs, using dynamic attention and LLM prompts for better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods decouple temporal and spatial learning, weakening interactions and increasing complexity. SE-HTGNN aims to address this gap.

Method: Integrates temporal modeling into spatial learning via dynamic attention and leverages LLMs for implicit node-type properties.

Result: Achieves 10x speed-up over baselines while maintaining top forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: SE-HTGNN effectively combines spatio-temporal learning and leverages LLMs for improved heterogeneous temporal graph representation.

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

TL;DR: A benchmarking study evaluates fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, revealing trade-offs between accuracy and fairness, and showing performance variations based on methods and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior fairness-aware GNN studies overlooked knowledge graphs, despite their importance in applications like recommender systems.

Method: New graphs were generated from YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, benchmarking preprocessing and inprocessing methods across GNN backbones and early stopping conditions.

Result: Knowledge graphs show distinct fairness-accuracy trade-offs, performance varies with methods and conditions, and preprocessing improves fairness while inprocessing boosts accuracy.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware GNN performance on knowledge graphs depends on method choices, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in this domain.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: USC introduces uncertainty-aware modulation in RL critic training to balance safety and performance, reducing violations by ~40% while maintaining rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the imbalance in existing RL methods where strict safety enforcement hampers task performance or lax safety leads to frequent violations.

Method: Introduces the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), integrating uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into critic training to focus conservatism.

Result: USC reduces safety violations by ~40%, maintains competitive rewards, and improves cost gradient prediction by ~83%.

Conclusion: USC successfully breaks the trade-off between safety and performance, enabling scalable safe RL.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

TL;DR: COPPOL integrates conformal prediction into semantic segmentation for reliable hazard detection and navigation, offering finite-sample safety guarantees and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires accurate hazard perception and uncertainty handling with finite-sample guarantees, which existing methods lack.

Method: COPPOL combines conformal prediction with semantic segmentation to create calibrated hazard maps and integrates them into downstream reinforcement learning planning.

Result: COPPOL improves hazard coverage (up to 6x) and reduces hazardous violations (up to 50%), maintaining robustness to distributional shifts.

Conclusion: COPPOL provides a robust, uncertainty-aware approach for safety-critical navigation, outperforming baselines while ensuring safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

*Christopher Ratigan,Kyle Heuton,Carissa Wang,Lenore Cowen,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to address limitations of ROC analysis for hospital alert systems by incorporating precision and capacity constraints, defining a new metric called partial VOROS for cost-aware classifier ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ROC analysis fails to consider key deployment factors like precision constraints and capacity bounds in hospital alert systems, and lacks cost asymmetry reflection.

Method: The paper represents feasible classifiers meeting constraints in ROC space, defines the 'partial area of lesser classifiers,' and introduces the partial VOROS metric.

Result: Experiments on MIMIC-IV dataset show partial VOROS outperforms alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses ROC analysis shortcomings for hospital alerts, providing a cost-aware solution.

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

*Giovanni De Muri,Mark Vero,Robin Staab,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores security risks in knowledge distillation from backdoored LLMs, introducing T-MTB for transferable backdoors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downstream users compress LLMs via knowledge distillation, but untrusted teacher models pose security risks, especially from backdoors.

Method: Introduces T-MTB, a technique crafting composite triggers from common tokens to ensure stealthy poisoning and transferable backdoors.

Result: Demonstrates transferable backdoors' risks in jailbreaking and content modulation across four LLM families.

Conclusion: Existing methods underestimate distillation risks; T-MTB highlights the need for secure distillation practices.

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable

TL;DR: RAISE framework evaluates AI models holistically across explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability, revealing trade-offs among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend AI evaluation beyond predictive accuracy to include ethical and practical dimensions for high-stakes applications.

Method: Introduce RAISE framework to quantify and aggregate performance across four responsibility dimensions. Evaluate MLP, Tabular ResNet, and Transformer on structured datasets.

Result: MLP excels in sustainability and robustness, Transformer in explainability and fairness (with high environmental cost), Tabular ResNet offers balance.

Conclusion: No single model dominates all responsibility criteria, emphasizing the need for multi-dimensional evaluation.

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

*Yusi Fan,Tian Wang,Zhiying Yan,Chang Liu,Qiong Zhou,Qi Lu,Zhehao Guo,Ziqi Deng,Wenyu Zhu,Ruochi Zhang,Fengfeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeFS improves feature selection by identifying overlooked complementary features using genetic algorithms and multi-objective optimization, outperforming existing methods across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature selection methods suffer from premature convergence and miss subtle features, especially in high-dimensional data.

Method: HeFS uses biased initialization, ratio-guided mutation in a genetic algorithm, and Pareto-based optimization to find complementary feature subsets.

Result: HeFS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 18 datasets, including challenging domains like cancer classification and drug toxicity prediction.

Conclusion: HeFS effectively enhances feature selection by capturing overlooked features, offering improved performance in diverse applications.

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

*Chia-Hsuan Lu,Tony Tan,Michael Benedikt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RobLight improves adversarial robustness detection in GNNs by using efficient partial solvers instead of powerful constraint solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing adversarial attacks in GNNs, where perturbations can alter outputs, requires robust methods beyond traditional constraint-solving approaches.

Method: The proposed approach replaces powerful solvers (e.g., mixed integer programming) with efficient partial solvers that run in polynomial time but may be incomplete.

Result: RobLight outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on diverse GNN variants and datasets.

Conclusion: Using partial solvers enhances adversarial robustness detection in GNNs efficiently.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

*Fayad Ali Banna,Antoine Caradot,Eduardo Brandao,Jean-Philippe Colombier,Rémi Emonet,Marc Sebban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unrolled-SINDy improves PDE discovery stability by decoupling numerical time steps from data sampling rates, enabling recovery of equation parameters otherwise missed by traditional SINDy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SINDy methods struggle with sparsely sampled temporal data, limiting their effectiveness in PDE discovery for real-world problems.

Method: Unrolled-SINDy uses an unrolling scheme to stabilize explicit methods, allowing flexible time steps independent of data sampling rates. It offers iterative closed-form or gradient descent solutions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate Unrolled-SINDy's versatility, successfully addressing problems beyond non-unrolled methods' reach, even with noisy data and various numerical schemes.

Conclusion: Unrolled-SINDy enhances PDE discovery by overcoming limitations of sparse temporal sampling, proving effective across traditional and advanced SINDy variants.

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

*Gilles Audemard,Sylvie Coste-Marquis,Pierre Marquis,Mehdi Sabiri,Nicolas Szczepanski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method distills boosted trees into decision trees for balanced predictive performance and interpretability, using rectification, showing promising empirical results compared to retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to create an ML model that balances predictive performance and interpretability by distilling complex boosted trees into simpler decision trees.

Method: The approach uses rectification to distill boosted trees into decision trees, avoiding the need for retraining.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that rectification provides competitive outcomes compared to retraining-based distillation.

Conclusion: The rectification-based distillation method effectively balances performance and interpretability, offering a viable alternative to retraining.

Abstract: We present a new approach for distilling boosted trees into decision trees,
in the objective of generating an ML model offering an acceptable compromise in
terms of predictive performance and interpretability. We explain how the
correction approach called rectification can be used to implement such a
distillation process. We show empirically that this approach provides
interesting results, in comparison with an approach to distillation achieved by
retraining the model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP) setting, showing that learning DFAs and Boolean formulas remains computationally hard despite richer labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the NSP setting for PAC-learning analysis and explore its applicability in learning language models.

Method: Use reductions from conventional learning problems to NSP learning, demonstrating computational hardness.

Result: Learning DFAs and Boolean formulas in the NSP setting is computationally hard under cryptographic assumptions.

Conclusion: The NSP setting, while richer in labels, does not simplify learning complex concept classes like DFAs.

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how transformers perform in-context learning (ICL) for Markovian functions, revealing limitations of linear self-attention (LSA) models and interpreting multilayer LSA as optimizing multiple objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand transformers' ability to learn dynamics-driven functions via ICL, beyond linear regression tasks.

Method: Investigates Markovian function learning through structured ICL, characterizes loss landscape, and provides theoretical proofs.

Result: Closed-form global minimizer for one-layer LSA, NP-hardness of parameter recovery, and multilayer LSA as gradient descent optimizer.

Conclusion: Theoretical limitations of one-layer LSA are highlighted, and numerical validation supports findings.

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

*Miro Miranda,Marcela Charfuelan,Matias Valdenegro Toro,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study combines crop simulation models and machine learning to predict crop yield based on water scarcity, offering high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing water shortages for agricultural productivity and food security requires accurate and explainable crop yield prediction models.

Method: Couples crop simulation models with machine learning, using temporal water scarcity data, satellite imagery, meteorological data, and a physics-informed loss function.

Result: Achieves an R²-score of up to 0.82, outperforming LSTM and Transformers, while providing explainability.

Conclusion: The method supports decision-making for resilient agriculture amid climate change.

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

*Madeline Navarro,Lisa O'Bryan,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flexible probabilistic model predicts turn-taking in group conversations using individual traits and past behavior, addressing limitations of previous universal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models often lack generalizability beyond single groups and may not suit all contexts, prompting a more adaptable approach.

Method: The model generalizes prior work by incorporating personality traits and speaking history to predict turn-taking, including variations in speaking inclination based on last spoken time.

Result: Applied to synthetic and real-world data, the model shows improved realism over previous behavioral models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines data-driven insights with theoretical grounding for better prediction of group conversation dynamics.

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

*Howard Chen,Noam Razin,Karthik Narasimhan,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL post-training causes less catastrophic forgetting than SFT while maintaining similar or better task performance, due to its mode-seeking nature using on-policy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different post-training methods (SFT and RL) affect catastrophic forgetting in LMs and identify mitigation strategies.

Method: Systematic comparison of forgetting patterns in LMs (Llama, Qwen) across tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, arithmetic reasoning), using RL and SFT. Simplified LM modeling as a mixture of distributions was also explored.

Result: RL leads to less forgetting than SFT, attributed to its mode-seeking behavior via on-policy data. KL regularization or advantage estimation were not primary factors.

Conclusion: RL's on-policy data usage reduces forgetting, and approximately on-policy data can be a practical mitigation strategy.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

*Mustafa Fuad Rifet Ibrahim,Tunc Alkanat,Maurice Meijer,Felix Manthey,Alexander Schlaefer,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using deep learning for classifying ECG and PCG data on edge devices, achieving efficient, low-resource consumption while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cardiovascular diseases via wearable sensors requires robust, efficient data analysis. Deep learning can automate this, reducing clinician workload.

Method: A convolutional neural network with early fusion of ECG and PCG data is proposed and tested on Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.

Result: The model reduces memory and compute costs significantly (three orders of magnitude) vs. state-of-the-art while keeping competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach is feasible for medical edge devices, with energy-efficient on-device inference outperforming continuous data streaming.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

TL;DR: The paper examines the serving performance of Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs), highlighting unique challenges like memory usage and straggler requests, and evaluates existing optimization techniques' effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration into RLLM serving performance, which hinders real-world deployment.

Method: Conducts a pilot study comparing RLLM and traditional LLM serving performance, tests existing inference optimization techniques (e.g., quantization, speculative decoding), and evaluates under real-world workloads.

Result: Quantization and speculative decoding improve efficiency with minor accuracy trade-offs, while prefix caching and KV cache quantization may degrade performance for small RLLMs.

Conclusion: Provides insights for improving RLLM serving efficiency, benefiting both research and industry.

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task-agnostic framework using a 'majority vote' objective function for multi-teacher distillation, leveraging teacher diversity without task-specific labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tailoring multi-teacher distillation to specific tasks and enhance representation learning across diverse input modalities.

Method: Proposes a 'majority vote' objective function bounded by mutual information, creating a task-agnostic distillation loss.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across text, vision, and molecular modeling, improving performance in downstream tasks like classification and regression.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages teacher diversity, yielding state-of-the-art embedding models for versatile applications.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

TL;DR: The paper addresses RL challenges with multi-step predictions, proposing Bayesian value functions, Bellman-Jensen Gap analysis, and BOLA algorithm for efficient learning under imperfect predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL struggles with high-dimensional multi-step predictions. Real-world applications like energy management benefit from such predictions, but existing methods fail to handle their complexity and errors.

Method: Proposes Bayesian value functions for tractable policies, Bellman-Jensen Gap analysis for imperfect predictions, and BOLA algorithm combining offline Bayesian learning with online adaptation.

Result: BOLA maintains sample efficiency even with imperfect predictions, validated on synthetic MDPs and wind energy storage control.

Conclusion: The innovations bridge RL theory and practice for multi-step predictions, offering scalable solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniCast is a scalable probabilistic weather forecasting model combining a VAE for encoding weather data and a diffusion-based transformer for forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art performance across timescales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve weather forecasting accuracy across all timescales, addressing limitations of autoregressive deep learning methods in subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions.

Method: Combines a VAE for dimensionality reduction and a diffusion-based transformer for iterative token generation, mitigating autoregressive error accumulation.

Result: Competes with leading probabilistic methods in medium-range forecasts (10x-20x faster) and achieves SOTA in subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasts; stable rollouts up to 100 years.

Conclusion: OmniCast unifies forecasting across timescales effectively, offering speed, accuracy, and stability, with potential for long-term climate modeling.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces M-AUPO, an algorithm for online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) using ranking feedback under the Plackett-Luce model, demonstrating improved sample efficiency with larger action subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in PbRL where existing methods fail to leverage richer ranking feedback effectively, leading to suboptimal performance despite increased feedback length.

Method: The authors propose M-AUPO, which selects multiple actions by maximizing average uncertainty within subsets, using the Plackett-Luce model for ranking feedback.

Result: M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $	ilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, showing direct performance improvement with larger subsets.

Conclusion: This work provides the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly links subset size to improved sample efficiency, avoiding exponential dependence on unknown parameters.

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

*Harry Amad,Zhaozhi Qian,Dennis Frauen,Julianna Piskorz,Stefan Feuerriegel,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STEAM is a novel method generating synthetic medical data for treatment effect analysis, emphasizing preservation of covariate distribution, treatment assignment, and outcome mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets are hard to access; synthetic data can enable causal inference and method development.

Method: STEAM mimics data-generating processes for treatments and optimizes desiderata: covariate, treatment assignment, and outcome preservation.

Result: STEAM outperforms existing generative models, especially with complex data-generating processes.

Conclusion: STEAM provides high-quality synthetic data for medical treatment effect analysis, enhancing causal inference tasks.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

### [246] [Enhancing Fractional Gradient Descent with Learned Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18783)
*Jan Sobotka,Petr Šimánek,Pavel Kordík*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) shows potential but struggles with convergence and hyperparameter tuning. The proposed L2O-CFGD dynamically tunes hyperparameters, outperforming static CFGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FGD accelerates optimization but lacks understanding of hyperparameter impact, especially in non-convex settings.

Method: Introduces L2O-CFGD, a meta-learning approach to dynamically tune Caputo FGD hyperparameters.

Result: L2O-CFGD outperforms static CFGD and matches some black-box meta-learned optimizers.

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD aids researchers in optimizing hyperparameters and understanding fractional calculus benefits.

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

*Soroush Tabesh,Mher Safaryan,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces CAGE, a curvature-aware QAT method improving accuracy in low-bit quantization by balancing loss minimization and quantization constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the accuracy gap between low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) and native training by addressing gradient estimation issues.

Method: CAGE augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a curvature-aware correction, derived from a multi-objective QAT view.

Result: Recovers over 10% of quantization-induced loss increase in W4A4 regime for Llama-style models up to 800M parameters.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware gradient corrections like CAGE can outperform current outlier-handling methods in QAT.

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

*Federica Granese,Serena Villata,Charles Bouveyron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SB-SETM extends ETM for online topic modeling, handling data streams by merging topic models from document batches and inferring active topics dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of evolving data streams in topic modeling, which are less explored compared to offline methods.

Method: SB-SETM uses truncated stick-breaking for topic-per-document distribution and optimal transport for merging topic embeddings.

Result: Outperforms baselines in simulations and tests on real-world news articles about the Russian-Ukrainian war.

Conclusion: SB-SETM effectively addresses challenges in online topic modeling with promising results.

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

### [249] [On Biologically Plausible Learning in Continuous Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18808)
*Marc Gong Bacvanski,Liu Ziyin,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A continuous-time neural model unifies biological learning algorithms, eliminating phase separation and showing stable learning under biological timescales. Temporal overlap between inputs and error signals is critical for correct synaptic updates, with plasticity timescales needing to exceed stimulus duration by orders of magnitude for robust learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between discrete algorithmic models and continuous biological learning, unifying multiple biologically plausible learning rules under a single framework.

Method: A continuous-time neural model is developed, incorporating temporal dynamics to unify learning algorithms like SGD, FA, DFA, and KP. Simulations test stability and robustness under biological conditions.

Result: Continuous-time networks learn stably at biological timescales, with temporal overlap between inputs and error signals determining learning success. Robust learning requires plasticity timescales to significantly exceed stimulus duration.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates that seconds-scale eligibility traces are essential for error-driven learning in biological circuits, providing a testable prediction for biological studies.

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

*Weiqiu You,Siqi Zeng,Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai,Makoto Yamada,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the limitations of Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) in Transformers, showing violations of the implementation invariance axiom and proposing improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiency of Leave-One-Out (LOO) and evaluate the axiomatic soundness of LRP in Transformers.

Method: Analyzed bilinear propagation rules in AttnLRP and revisited CP-LRP as a baseline, testing relevance propagation bypassing softmax layers.

Result: Bilinear rules violate axioms, and bypassing softmax improves alignment with LOO.

Conclusion: Bilinear sensitivity and softmax errors undermine LRP's approximation of LOO in Transformers.

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

TL;DR: This review unifies iterative optimization methods in AI, comparing gradient-based (backpropagation) with derivative-free (zeroth-order) approaches. It highlights ZO methods' relevance in biology, linking them to brain learning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge classic optimization theory with neural network training and biological learning, emphasizing computational and biological scalability.

Method: Categorizes optimization by derivative order, explores adaptation to neural networks, and links ZO methods to biological learning.

Result: Demonstrates ZO methods can rival BP in neural networks and parallels biological learning, suggesting noise exploitation.

Conclusion: A ZO framework offers insights into natural intelligence and neuromorphic AI design, leveraging noise efficiently.

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

*Mengqi Li,Lei Zhao,Anthony Man-Cho So,Ruoyu Sun,Xiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online Supervised Finetuning (OSFT) is introduced as a simple, reward-free method for improving LLM reasoning by finetuning on self-generated data, showing comparable performance to reward-based methods like GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To propose an efficient, reward-free training strategy for enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging self-generated data.

Method: OSFT involves the model generating its own responses and immediately finetuning on this data, requiring just one rollout by default.

Result: OSFT achieves performance similar to reward-based reinforcement learning methods (e.g., GRPO) on mathematical reasoning tasks, with demonstrated efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: OSFT provides a simpler and effective alternative to complex reward-based training paradigms, leveraging latent knowledge from pretraining to improve reasoning.

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR relies on human-crafted tasks, limiting scalability. SSP introduces self-play training for deep search agents, using competition and cooperation between proposer and solver to improve performance without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce human effort in RLVR by automating task generation and solving through self-play, enhancing scalability and performance in agentic scenarios.

Method: Develop SSP, where LLMs act as both task proposers and solvers, generating queries with increasing difficulty and using RAG to ensure accuracy.

Result: SSP improves search agents' performance across benchmarks unsupervised, in both from-scratch and continuous RL setups.

Conclusion: SSP offers a scalable, unsupervised approach to enhance RLVR, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

TL;DR: BO4Mob is a benchmark framework for high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) tailored for origin-destination travel demand estimation in large urban networks, featuring real-world scenarios and evaluations of optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of estimating OD travel demand from limited traffic sensor data in large-scale networks drives the need for scalable optimization solutions.

Method: BO4Mob includes five real-world San Jose road network scenarios with dimensions up to 10,100, using high-resolution traffic simulations with nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. Five optimization methods (three BO algorithms, two non-BO baselines) are evaluated.

Result: The benchmark supports testing scalable optimization algorithms and their applications in urban mobility models, including digital twins.

Conclusion: BO4Mob provides a practical tool for developing and evaluating high-dimensional BO algorithms in complex transportation networks.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,
including high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks. Code and

*Yigit Korkmaz,Urvi Bhuwania,Ayush Jain,Erdem Bıyık*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a value-based framework for continuous control that avoids actor-critic methods, focusing on structural maximization of Q-functions for stable and efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional value-based algorithms are limited to discrete action spaces, while actor-critic methods, though common for continuous spaces, suffer from training instability.

Method: Proposes an actor-free Q-learning approach using structural maximization of Q-functions, with specific architectural and algorithmic adjustments.

Result: Demonstrates comparable performance and sample efficiency to state-of-the-art baselines, excelling in constrained action spaces where value functions are non-smooth.

Conclusion: The method eliminates the need for a separate actor, offering a simpler and more stable alternative to actor-critic approaches in continuous control.

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge causal reasoning and predictive modeling, enabling individualized risk assessment and intervention analysis in clinical settings.

Method: Integration of regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search, leveraging algorithms like NICE and MOC to explore high-dimensional intervention spaces.

Result: Strong discriminative performance (AUROC: 0.88) and generation of interpretable, patient-specific counterfactuals highlighting modifiable factors.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization problem, offering a rigorous and efficient approach for personalized biomedical inference.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAST introduces a novel framework for transferring LoRA-encoded behaviors between LLMs by mapping activation manifolds, achieving near-native performance without task-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural lock-in traps task-specific behaviors learned via LoRA within source models, limiting interoperability. Existing transfer methods are brittle and indirect.

Method: CAST learns bidirectional projection heads to map activation manifolds between models, decoupling skills from source architecture without task-specific data.

Result: CAST achieves 85-95% of native LoRA performance in zero-shot transfers, outperforming current weight-space techniques.

Conclusion: CAST establishes a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability by directly translating LoRA adapters between architectures.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a
fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through
fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped
within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural
lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the
static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on
tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a
fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation
Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors
by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the
geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two
distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen
"behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection
heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source
model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.
This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,
effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We
demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA
adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model
families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve
85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,
quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and
establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

TL;DR: The paper investigates if retrieval diversity improves LLM intent understanding under token budgets, proposing a diversity-aware framework that enhances accuracy without increasing prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of tight token budgets and noisy contexts in multi-turn intent understanding for task-oriented chatbots, the study explores whether diversity in retrieval outperforms longer prompts.

Method: Introduces a diversity-aware retrieval framework that balances intent coverage and linguistic variety, integrating it with standard LLM decoders. Evaluates under fixed budgets with randomized positions and sensitivity analyses.

Result: Achieves significant gains in Joint Goal Accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD datasets, outperforming baselines with consistent improvements across exemplar counts and moderate latency.

Conclusion: Validates the impact of retrieval diversity on intent understanding and offers a deployable solution for budget-constrained systems.

Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet
real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most
retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity
and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval
diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent
understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval
framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and
linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders;
the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and
includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and
backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in
Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST
baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate
latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content
diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for
building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent verbal reinforcement learning algorithm, $	extbackslash ours$, to dynamically improve collaboration structures in LLM systems, enhancing reasoning tasks like math and creative writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems for LLMs use predefined structures or majority voting, which may overlook minority contributions. Effective communication and debating quality are hypothesized as key factors for better reasoning.

Method: The proposed $	extbackslash ours$ algorithm dynamically constructs and refines collaboration structures using verbal reinforcement learning, with action spaces and feedback mechanisms to evaluate communication robustness and coherence. Decisions are made via majority vote.

Result: $	extbackslash ours$ outperforms single-agent methods and other multi-agent frameworks across reasoning tasks like math, creative writing, science, and numerical sorting.

Conclusion: Dynamic collaboration structures and improved communication quality significantly enhance multi-agent reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in
mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent
systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM
agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or
rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but
less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems
as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the
quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is
crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant
role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement
learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent
collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback
mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the
debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the
agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical
reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.
Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent
prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

### [260] [Subject-Event Ontology Without Global Time: Foundations and Execution Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18040)
*Alexander Boldachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formalization of a subject-event ontology for dynamic systems avoids global time, using event fixation, causal order, executable ontologies, and model-based validation. Practical application shown in Boldsea workflow engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex dynamic systems without relying on global time, addressing distributed systems, microservice architectures, and multiperspectivity scenarios.

Method: Proposes nine axioms ensuring correct executable ontologies, emphasizing event fixation, causal order, declarative dataflow, and model-based validation.

Result: Demonstrates practicality with Boldsea, a workflow engine implementing the ontology in Boldsea Semantic Language (BSL).

Conclusion: The formalization is versatile, applicable to diverse scenarios like distributed systems and DLT platforms, ensuring determinism and correctness.

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

*Joong Ho Choi,Jiayang Zhao,Jeel Shah,Ritvika Sonawane,Vedant Singh,Avani Appalla,Will Flanagan,Filipe Condessa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompactPrompt is a pipeline combining prompt and data compression to reduce LLM token usage and costs while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high run-time costs of LLMs in agentic workflows by minimizing token usage without significant accuracy loss.

Method: Uses self-information scoring, dependency-based phrase grouping, n-gram abbreviation, and uniform quantization for compression.

Result: Achieves up to 60% reduction in token usage and cost with less than 5% accuracy drop.

Conclusion: CompactPrompt enables leaner generative AI pipelines by balancing cost and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation
capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic
workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We
introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt
compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first
prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and
dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation
to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to
numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations.
Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage
and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA,
while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time
compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the
groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Planned diffusion combines autoregressive and diffusion models to improve text generation speed and quality by breaking output into spans and generating them simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between generation speed and output quality in large language model inference.

Method: Hybrid two-stage approach: autoregressive planning to create spans, followed by parallel diffusion generation of spans.

Result: Achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off on AlpacaEval, with 1.27x-1.81x speedup and minimal win rate drop (0.87%-5.4%).

Conclusion: Planned diffusion offers a practical solution for faster, high-quality text generation with flexible quality-latency control.

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off
between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce
high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can
generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same
quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the
model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,
independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using
diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides
a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a
suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x
speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win
rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism
of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to
provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaDA-Agent improves Small Language Models (SLMs) performance by using pattern-guided data augmentation, reducing reliance on manual fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs lag behind larger models in accuracy, especially for complex tasks, and current fine-tuning methods are labor-intensive.

Method: PaDA-Agent uses coordinated operations to discover failure patterns from validation data and drafts targeted augmentation strategies.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based data augmentation methods for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model.

Conclusion: PaDA-Agent efficiently enhances SLM performance with less manual effort, bridging the gap with larger models.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost
and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly
for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge
this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation
and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data
Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data
augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike
state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and
generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from
the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation
strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based
data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sentence-level labeled dataset for monitoring safety behaviors in LLM reasoning, enabling activation-based detection and steering to improve AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current textual reasoning analysis methods may miss subtle harmful patterns or be circumvented by models hiding unsafe reasoning, highlighting the need for finer-grained safety monitoring.

Method: The authors create a dataset with sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors (e.g., safety concerns, user intent speculation) and use it to extract steering vectors for detecting and influencing these behaviors in model activations.

Result: The dataset aids in identifying specific safety behaviors within reasoning chains, demonstrating its utility through representations that detect and steer safety behaviors in model activations.

Conclusion: Activation-level techniques show promise for enhancing safety oversight in reasoning, addressing gaps in existing holistic labeling approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought
reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual
reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by
models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset
that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM
reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level
annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or
speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for
detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset
fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning
holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring
could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within
reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting
representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model
activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for
improving safety oversight on reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel LLM-powered multi-agent framework simulates consumer decision-making and social dynamics, offering marketers scalable pre-implementation testing with actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like post-event analyses and rule-based ABMs fail to capture human behavior complexity, necessitating a more dynamic and realistic simulation tool.

Method: The framework uses large language models in a sandbox environment to create generative agents that interact, reason, form habits, and make decisions without predefined rules.

Result: In a price-discount scenario, the system provided actionable strategy-testing outcomes and revealed emergent social patterns unattainable with conventional methods.

Conclusion: This approach is a scalable, low-risk tool for marketers, reducing reliance on post-event evaluations and minimizing campaign risks.

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating
marketing strategies before costly real-world deployment. However, post-event
analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the
complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an
LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and
social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation
in a sandbox environment, our framework enables generative agents to interact,
express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without
predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the system delivers
actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns
beyond the reach of conventional methods. This approach offers marketers a
scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on
time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the risk of underperforming
campaigns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Saber, a training-free sampling algorithm for Diffusion Language Models (DLMs), improves inference speed and output quality in code generation by adaptive acceleration and backtracking, outperforming mainstream DLM methods with a 1.9% accuracy boost and 251.4% speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs show promise for parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling but struggle with the trade-off between speed and quality in code generation tasks.

Method: Saber introduces adaptive acceleration and backtracking mechanisms during sampling to enhance DLM performance without additional training.

Result: Saber achieves a 1.9% average improvement in Pass@1 accuracy and a 251.4% inference speedup across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Saber bridges the performance gap between DLMs and autoregressive models in code generation, leveraging DLM strengths effectively.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentChangeBench is introduced to evaluate tool-augmented language model agents' adaptation to mid-dialogue goal shifts, using four metrics across enterprise domains. Results reveal significant differences in model performance under dynamic goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack evaluation of agents' adaptability to mid-dialogue goal shifts, crucial for real-world interactions.

Method: AgentChangeBench formalizes evaluation using four metrics (TSR, TUE, TCRR, GSRT) across 2,835 task sequences and five personas.

Result: GPT-4o outperforms Gemini in recovery rates (92.2% vs. 48.6%), while retail tasks show high redundancy (80%) despite parameter validity.

Conclusion: AgentChangeBench highlights the need for explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy, providing a testbed for improving agent resilience.

Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions,
yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot
tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to
measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal
shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation
through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,
Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for
wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.
AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each
designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this
setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured
by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$
recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and
retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above
$80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high
raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit
measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench
establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent
resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantifiable framework to define AGI based on human cognition, revealing significant gaps in current AI systems despite rapid progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a clear AGI definition creates ambiguity about the gap between specialized AI and human cognition. Aiming to clarify this, the paper seeks to operationalize AGI benchmarking.

Method: The framework uses Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory to break AGI into 10 cognitive domains (e.g., reasoning, memory). Human psychometric tools are adapted to evaluate AI systems like GPT-4 and GPT-5.

Result: Current AI shows uneven performance ('jagged profile'), excelling in knowledge tasks but struggling with foundational skills like memory. AGI scores: GPT-4 (27%), GPT-5 (58%).

Conclusion: The framework highlights both progress and the significant gap toward AGI, emphasizing the need for broader cognitive capabilities in AI.

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This
paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as
matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To
operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,
the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects
general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,
memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to
evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged"
cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in
knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in
foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The
resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify
both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ssToken is a token-level selection method enhancing SFT for LLMs by avoiding extra reference models and incorporating semantic-aware metrics alongside loss-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token-level selection methods require additional reference models and rely solely on loss metrics, failing to preserve semantically important tokens.

Method: ssToken uses history models for self-modulated loss difference signals and introduces an attention-based semantic metric for token selection.

Result: ssToken outperforms full-data fine-tuning and prior methods, achieving synergistic gains with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: ssToken advances token-level selection by combining self-modulated and semantic-aware approaches, enhancing LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as
a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong
empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key
limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,
and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot
well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based
metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and
Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible
history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,
which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively
select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess
loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further
introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,
orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic
information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across
different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated
selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,
while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further
surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance
improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

### [271] [Illusions of reflection: open-ended task reveals systematic failures in Large Language Models' reflective reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18254)
*Sion Weatherhead,Flora Salim,Aaron Belbasis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit functional equivalence to human reflective reasoning. It tests eight frontier models on an open-ended, rule-constrained task (producing and revising scientific test items) and finds limited self-correction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs' 'reflective' text aligns with human-like reflective reasoning, especially in open-ended tasks where external correctness signals are absent.

Method: Eight frontier LLMs were tested on producing valid scientific test items and revising them based on their own critique. Performance was measured before and after reflection.

Result: First-pass performance was poor (mean ≈1 valid item out of 4). Reflection yielded modest gains (also ≈1). Models often repeated violations, indicating corrective gains were largely due to chance.

Conclusion: Current LLM 'reflection' lacks goal-driven monitoring akin to humans. Reliable performance requires external enforcement of constraints until models develop such mechanisms.

Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them
mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.
Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,
but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work
on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make
'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We
therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is
open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce
valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.
First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean
$\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1).
Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of
constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production
of a valid item rather than error detection and principled,
constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection
deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'
show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks
functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans
respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are
instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external
structure that enforces constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Genesis is a framework designed to improve web agent attacks by dynamically evolving strategies through modules like Attacker, Scorer, and Strategist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for web agent attacks are limited to static or manual approaches, failing to generalize across diverse environments.

Method: Genesis combines a genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation for adversarial injections, evaluates responses with a Scorer, and dynamically updates strategies.

Result: The framework discovers novel strategies and outperforms existing baselines across various web tasks.

Conclusion: Genesis enhances the effectiveness of web agent attacks by continuously evolving and deploying new strategies.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks,
they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks.
However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing
red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or
static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying
behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across
diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous
discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,
a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and
Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the
genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates
the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist
dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles
them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to
enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web
tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently
outperforms existing attack baselines.

Abstract: Geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet.

capabilities of our foundation models and validate that when used together,
they provide complementary value for geospatial inference and their synergies
unlock superior predictive capabilities. To handle complex, multi-step queries,
we developed a Gemini-powered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple

deliver critical and timely insights, effectively bridging the gap between raw

TL;DR: ShortcutBreaker is a unified feature-reconstruction framework for multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD), addressing identity shortcuts via a low-rank noisy bottleneck and global perturbation attention. It achieves superior performance on industrial and medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to eliminate the need for separate models for different classes in MUAD by preventing identity shortcuts, which degrade performance by making normal and abnormal cases harder to distinguish.

Method: The method includes a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project features into a low-rank space and a global perturbation attention mechanism to avoid shortcuts in decoders, leveraging Vision Transformers (ViTs).

Result: ShortcutBreaker achieves image-level AUROC scores of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on MVTec-AD, ViSA, Real-IAD, and Universal Medical datasets, outperforming previous MUAD methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights ShortcutBreaker's effectiveness in preventing identity shortcuts and its superior performance across diverse anomaly detection benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing
research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection
across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models
for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.
Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have
brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they
directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors
between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to
distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified
feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations
to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we
design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features
into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to
prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling
capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a
global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.
Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection
benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)
and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a
remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four
datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across
different scenarios.

### [275] [Heterogeneous Adversarial Play in Interactive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18407)
*Manjie Xu,Xinyi Yang,Jiayu Zhan,Wei Liang,Chi Zhang,Yixin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Heterogeneous Adversarial Play (HAP) introduces an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework for asymmetric skill acquisition, outperforming traditional self-play methods by dynamically adjusting task complexity based on learner performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of conventional self-play frameworks in asymmetric learning scenarios, inspired by human pedagogical systems where educators tailor challenges to learners' needs.

Method: HAP formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization, enabling bidirectional feedback where instructors adjust task complexity dynamically based on learner performance.

Result: HAP achieves performance parity with state-of-the-art baselines and enhances learning efficacy for both artificial agents and human subjects.

Conclusion: HAP successfully operationalizes asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms, proving effective in multi-task learning domains.

Abstract: Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill
acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through
self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks
exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach
proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent
asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional
frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to
individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge
resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms
within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate
curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous
Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework
that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein
task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through
adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ
static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a
bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task
complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental
validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework
achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that
enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Med-VRAgent, a framework combining Visual Guidance, Self-Reward paradigms, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance medical visual reasoning in VLMs, addressing issues like hallucinations and poor localization. Fine-tuning with PPO further improves performance, as validated on medical VQA benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs show promise in medical reasoning but suffer from hallucinations, vague descriptions, inconsistent logic, and poor localization. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: Developed Med-VRAgent, integrating Visual Guidance, Self-Reward paradigms, and MCTS. Feedback from trajectories is used to fine-tune VLMs using PPO.

Result: Experiments show Med-VRAgent outperforms existing methods on medical VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances medical visual reasoning in VLMs, demonstrating superior performance through innovative paradigms and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results in medical reasoning
but struggle with hallucinations, vague descriptions, inconsistent logic and
poor localization. To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical
Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual
Guidance and Self-Reward paradigms and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By
combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the
medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories
collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by
fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective.
Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches.

*Chenxu Zhang,Fuxiang Huang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called UWAssess uses foundation models to automate urban waterlogging detection and assessment, addressing data scarcity with semi-supervised fine-tuning and CoT prompting. It improves perception and generates reliable reports, aiding urban management and disaster response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban waterlogging threatens public safety, but current monitoring methods lack timeliness and comprehensiveness. Automated solutions are needed.

Method: UWAssess employs a foundation model-driven framework with semi-supervised fine-tuning and CoT prompting to handle scarce labeled data.

Result: It shows improved perception performance and generates reliable textual reports on waterlogging details.

Conclusion: UWAssess enables smarter, scalable monitoring systems for urban management and climate resilience.

Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly
severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing
monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide
timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban
Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that
automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates
structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we
design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for
data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks
demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based
evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual
reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.
This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception
to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models
lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban
management, disaster response and climate resilience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaOPT is a self-improving experience library for LLMs, enabling learning from limited demonstrations and solver feedback without annotated traces or parameter updates. It operates in a continual two-phase cycle, improving efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating optimization modeling is challenging due to the need to map informal language to precise formulations. Prior LLM approaches lack robustness or require costly retraining.

Method: AlphaOPT uses a two-phase cycle: Library Learning (extracting solver-verified insights) and Library Evolution (refining applicability conditions). It avoids retraining by updating a library.

Result: AlphaOPT improves steadily with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 items) and outperforms baselines by 7.7% on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: AlphaOPT offers efficient learning, continual improvement without retraining, and interpretable knowledge, making it a scalable solution for automation.

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but
remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise
mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches
either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited
generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that
enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone,
without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated
reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual
two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts,
extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition,
explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses
retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored
insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently
from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually
without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights,
and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and
intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data
(65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest
baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only
on answers. Code and data are available at:

### [280] [PlanU: Large Language Model Decision Making through Planning under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18442)
*Ziwei Deng,Mian Deng,Chenjing Liang,Zeming Gao,Chennan Ma,Chenxing Lin,Haipeng Zhang,Songzhu Mei,Cheng Wang,Siqi Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanU is an LLM-based planning method using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with quantile distributions to handle uncertainty in multi-step decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with decision-making under uncertainty, especially in stochastic environments, due to overlooked environmental uncertainty in existing approaches.

Method: PlanU integrates quantile distributions into MCTS nodes and uses an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: PlanU effectively improves LLM-based decision-making performance in uncertain environments, as shown in experiments.

Conclusion: PlanU addresses both LLM and environmental uncertainty, offering a robust solution for LLM-based planning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range
of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making
tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning
actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is
impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental
uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process
inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM
uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these
approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance
in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches
deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables.
However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that
require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM
decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures
uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of
each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles
to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation
during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity
(UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based
decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuitSeer improves LLM training efficiency by selecting data based on internal reasoning circuits, achieving better performance with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods rely on costly external models or opaque heuristics, prompting a focus on internal model mechanisms for efficiency.

Method: CircuitSeer identifies and measures influence on sparse, specialized attention heads (core reasoning circuits) to quantify reasoning complexity in data.

Result: Fine-tuning on 10% of CircuitSeer-selected data outperforms full dataset training, yielding a 1.4-point gain in Pass@1 scores.

Conclusion: CircuitSeer offers an efficient, effective alternative to traditional data selection methods by leveraging internal model mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of
data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over
training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A probabilistic intent modeling framework for LLM agents improves adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty, showing significant improvements in multi-turn social dialogue benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the social intelligence of LLM agents by modeling partner intentions probabilistically in multi-turn dialogues.

Method: The framework maintains a belief distribution over latent intentions, updated dynamically through likelihood estimation after each utterance, providing contextual grounding for adaptive strategies.

Result: Preliminary experiments show improvements: 9.0% on SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard, even slightly outperforming an oracle agent with direct intent observation.

Conclusion: Probabilistic intent modeling shows promise for developing socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model
(LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief
distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual
priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each
utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding
for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.
Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent
improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on
SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and
slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.
These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute
to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

*Haichao Ji,Zibo Wang,Yifei Zhu,Meng han,Dan Wang,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAFA integrates LLM-agent-based analytics with federated analytics (FA) for privacy-preserving, natural language-driven data analysis, outperforming baselines in efficiency and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based analytics lack privacy protection, while FA lacks natural language support. LAFA bridges this gap by combining both approaches.

Method: LAFA uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture to transform natural language queries into optimized FA workflows via coarse-grained planning, fine-grained mapping, and DAG optimization.

Result: LAFA achieves higher execution plan success rates and reduces FA operations significantly compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: LAFA provides a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics with natural language support in FA settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

TL;DR: StarBench is a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to mimic human-like gameplay, focusing on multimodal decision-making and information seeking in Honkai: Star Rail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if VLMs can replicate human-like gameplay behaviors, such as mapping screenshots to actions and knowing when to seek guidance.

Method: Introduces StarBench with two regimes: direct control (raw screenshots to actions) and tool-assisted control (higher-level intents with optional textual cues). Includes an ask-or-act diagnostic.

Result: VLMs show gaps in perception-to-control fidelity but benefit from judicious information seeking, correlating with improved performance.

Conclusion: StarBench serves as a reproducible standard for evaluating agentic information seeking and multimodal decision-making in real-client gameplay.

Abstract: Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen
into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information
before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can
do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool
scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to
temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance -
remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark
derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:
multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information
seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two
regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive
only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with
no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents
can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional
textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,
StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when
agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice
affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary
VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in
perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that
judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing
StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and
multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current benchmarks for GUI agents, introduces an improved benchmark (AndroidControl-Curated), and presents Magma-R1-3B, a smaller yet competitive model trained on curated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents are underestimated due to flawed benchmarks, hindering their real-world adoption despite their potential.

Method: Identified issues in AndroidControl benchmark, developed AndroidControl-Curated through rigorous refinement, and trained Magma-R1-3B on 2.4k curated samples.

Result: Improved benchmark shows state-of-the-art models achieve 75% success rates (15% higher), and Magma-R1-3B matches larger models like Qwen3-VL-235B despite being 200x smaller.

Conclusion: Enhanced benchmarks and smaller, efficient models like Magma-R1-3B demonstrate GUI agents' readiness for practical deployment.

Abstract: On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly
pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid,
developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent
alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor
performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at
around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world
use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the
benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl,
including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent
capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl
into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved
through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark,
state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15%
improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to
practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model,
Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an
H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters,
this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both
AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community,
encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model
capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual
assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research overlooks Tuning Potential in control algorithms, focusing instead on ideal/default performance. Crucible aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Crucible employs multi-level expert simulation driven by LLMs and defines a formalized metric to quantify Tuning Potential.

Result: Crucible successfully quantifies tunable space across algorithms and aids in performance improvements through systematic analysis.

Conclusion: Crucible introduces a novel approach to evaluating and improving algorithm performance by focusing on Tuning Potential.

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain
experts to tune their parameters and logic for specific scenarios. However,
existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal
or default configurations, overlooking the critical aspect of Tuning Potential.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven,
multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized
metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate
Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic
control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a
real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible
systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms.
Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and
design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is

### [287] [Counterfactual Reasoning for Steerable Pluralistic Value Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18526)
*Hanze Guo,Jing Yao,Xiao Zhou,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COUPLE is a framework using counterfactual reasoning and causal modeling to align LLMs with diverse human values, addressing value complexity and steerability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods oversimplify pluralistic human values by treating them as independent and equally important, missing their interdependence and priorities.

Method: COUPLE employs a structural causal model (SCM) to capture value interdependencies and priorities, then uses counterfactual reasoning to generate value-aligned outputs.

Result: COUPLE outperforms baselines on two datasets with diverse value systems, offering better interpretability and alignment with nuanced value objectives.

Conclusion: COUPLE effectively addresses challenges in aligning LLMs with pluralistic human values, providing a scalable and interpretable solution.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and
demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond
average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such
as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple
value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods
encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:
1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,
ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)
they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those
underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we
propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE
alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex
interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal
relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it
applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired
value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also
provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with
different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines
across diverse types of value objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a hydrologic emulator combining long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance constraint for reliable flood forecasting under data inconsistencies. It tests robustness across diverse scenarios and regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hydrologic models lack operational resilience when faced with delayed, missing, or inconsistent input data, necessitating robust forecasting systems.

Method: Couples long- and short-term memory networks with a water-balance constraint; evaluates five architectures under varying data availability scenarios.

Result: The emulator replicates GloFAS's hydrological core effectively and degrades smoothly with declining data quality, demonstrating robust performance in diverse basins.

Conclusion: The framework measures operational robustness in hydrological machine learning, advancing reliable real-time forecasting systems.

Abstract: Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable
when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances
in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions,
emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an
operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that
couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance
constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum
of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to
scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of
robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States
and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in
India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades
smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting
hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent
performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and
human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a
measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of
reliable real-time forecasting systems.

Motivation: To address the brittleness of prompt pipelines and scale simulator construction across domains and granularities with minimal expert effort.

Method: Specialized LLM-driven agents perform code synthesis, execution, evaluation, and repair within a textual computation graph, optimized via Textual-Gradient Descent (TGD).

Result: SOCIA-Nabla achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in CPS tasks (User Modeling, Mask Adoption, Personal Mobility).

Conclusion: SOCIA-Nabla demonstrates scalable, reproducible simulator code generation, unifying multi-agent orchestration with loss-aligned optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that
treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a
textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph
nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->
execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient
Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec
confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the
trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,
and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.
By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,
SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,
constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and
simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the
code soon.

### [290] [Extracting alignment data in open models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18554)
*Federico Barbero,Xiangming Gu,Christopher A. Choquette-Choo,Chawin Sitawarin,Matthew Jagielski,Itay Yona,Petar Veličković,Ilia Shumailov,Jamie Hayes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that alignment training data can be extracted from post-trained models using embedding models, revealing risks and implications for distillation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the potential for extracting alignment data from models post-training and its implications for model performance and safety.

Method: Uses embedding models to measure semantic similarities in extracted data, contrasting with traditional string-matching methods.

Result: Found that embedding models capture more data (10× more) than string matching, and extracted data can retrain base models effectively.

Conclusion: Exposes risks in alignment data extraction and raises questions about distillation's indirect training effects.

Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of
alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model
to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,
instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on
memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction
through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for
our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model
can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such
as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,
approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative
estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial
artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily
regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or
RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a
meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a
possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work
opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation
practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,
distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's
original dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of developing personalized trading strategies in dynamic markets while exploring vast strategy spaces and maintaining diversity for robust performance.

Method: Combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy generation, using a feature map aligned with investor preferences and a multi-agent system for systematic exploration.

Result: Produces diverse, adaptive strategies that outperform conventional baselines and adapt to market shifts and individual needs.

Conclusion: QuantEvolve validates its effectiveness through empirical results and releases a dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is
challenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment
solutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while
preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing
market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that
combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy
generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor
preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return
characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also
integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the
strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach
produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime
shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve
outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a
dataset of evolved strategies to support future research.

*Wei Cai,Jian Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Tianle Zhang,Ming Zhu,Haichuan Tang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAR is a novel framework addressing MLLMs' hallucination and linear reasoning issues by decomposing reasoning into traceable grounding and search-based CoT generation, validated by theoretical analysis and superior benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models suffer from high hallucination tendencies and reliance on brittle linear reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in complex tasks.

Method: VAR introduces Visual Attention Reasoning, decomposing reasoning into traceable evidence grounding and search-based CoT generation with backtracking. A multi-faceted reward function guides the search.

Result: VAR-7B outperforms existing open-source models and competes with proprietary systems on hallucination and safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: VAR effectively mitigates hallucinations and enhances reasoning robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are
hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle,
linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address
these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel
framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a
reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key
stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)
generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.
The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and
geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not
faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for
our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution
with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,
sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and
safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and
demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new classification approach combines data mining-derived association rules with tree-based models to enhance predictive performance and generate better explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive performance and explanation quality in classification tasks by integrating data-derived association rules with tree-based models.

Method: Use data mining to derive association rules (including negations) from data, then leverage these rules to enhance tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) for classification and abductive explanation generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved predictive performance and more concise explanations for decision trees and random forests.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates data-derived rules with tree-based models, yielding benefits in both predictive accuracy and explanatory power.

Abstract: We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge.
In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly
with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive
performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a
classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding
explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more
general than those derivable without taking such rules into account.
Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration,
benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and
in terms of explanation sizes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how to model uncertainty in formal argumentation, comparing abstract and structured approaches, and introduces expressivity criteria with both negative and positive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in practical instantiations of abstract models for arguing with uncertainty, grounding uncertainty in structured argument components like rules and premises.

Method: Introduces a notion of expressivity for abstract and structured formalisms, comparing their capabilities through theoretical analysis.

Result: Provides negative and positive expressivity results, impacting incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks and structured models like ASPIC+.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of qualitative uncertainty in argumentation by bridging abstract and structured models, offering practical insights.

Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both
for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the
existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty.
Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of
studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground
the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and
premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion
of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the
presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the
expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with
uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks,
and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the
structured side.

*Roxana Petcu,Kenton Murray,Daniel Khashabi,Evangelos Kanoulas,Maarten de Rijke,Dawn Lawrie,Kevin Duh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG systems improve complex query handling by decomposing queries, retrieving documents, and balancing broad retrieval with noise reduction using bandit learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance efficiency in document retrieval for RAG systems by balancing relevance and computational cost.

Method: Formulate query decomposition and retrieval as an exploitation-exploration problem, employing bandit learning methods for dynamic sub-query selection.

Result: Bandit learning methods increase document-level precision by 35%, improve {α}-nDCG by 15%, and enhance long-form generation performance.

Conclusion: Bandit learning methods effectively optimize document retrieval in RAG systems, improving both relevance and downstream task results.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by
decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for
each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting
informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving
broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting
retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query
decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting,
where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a
given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an
alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and
demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative
sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank
information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision,
15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of
long-form generation.

*Dong Yun,Marco Schouten,Dim Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SherlockLLM is a dialogue-driven retrieval framework using RL to learn optimal questioning strategies, improving efficiency and performance in ambiguous query scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of current dialogue-based retrieval systems lacking explicit questioning strategies for clarifying user intent.

Method: SherlockLLM trains an RL agent to generate binary questions, narrowing search spaces without requiring large annotated datasets.

Result: Matches baselines on structured tasks and outperforms them on unstructured tasks, demonstrating robust dialogue policy learning.

Conclusion: SherlockLLM is an effective solution for ambiguous queries, combining efficiency and performance through learned questioning strategies.

Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it
challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While
recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,
they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most
informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a
dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy
via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated
dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of
binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.
Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.
On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and
approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging
unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines,
showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue
policy.

*Patterson Hsieh,Jerry Yeh,Mao-Chi He,Wen-Han Hsieh,Elvis Hsieh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALGOS introduces a scalable AI-driven system combining segmentation and reasoning for monitoring harmful algal blooms, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is increasing harmful algal blooms (HABs), requiring efficient monitoring solutions beyond labor-intensive traditional methods.

Method: Integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for segmentation and fine-tunes vision-language models using NASA's CAML dataset for severity estimation.

Result: ALGOS achieves robust performance in segmentation and severity estimation, enabling automated cyanobacterial monitoring.

Conclusion: ALGOS advances practical, automated solutions for HAB monitoring, addressing scalability and accuracy challenges.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 18 years of NSERC-funded research proposals to understand evolving trends and demographic influences, comparing LDA, STM, and BERTopic topic models. It introduces COFFEE, a novel algorithm for BERTopic covariate analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize national scientific investment by understanding research trends and equity-driven factors, addressing gaps in covariate analysis for BERTopic.

Method: Comparative evaluation of LDA, STM, and BERTopic, plus introduction of COFFEE for BERTopic covariate effects.

Result: BERTopic outperformed others in identifying granular themes (e.g., AI growth), and COFFEE revealed provincial specializations and gender-based patterns.

Conclusion: Provides empirical insights for equitable funding strategies, enhancing scientific ecosystem effectiveness.

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of
evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping
them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research
proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three
topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic
Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named
COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.
This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native
function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings
highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,
BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and
emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct
provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based
thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a
robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more
equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness
of the scientific ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving psychological depth and consistent persona behavior in LLM-based social simulations.

Method: Integrates Transactional Analysis by modeling agents with Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, managed by an Orchestrator Agent.

Result: Demonstrates realistic ego state shifts and effective conflict modeling in educational scenarios, with high conversational credibility.

Conclusion: TACLA advances AI tools for education by enabling dynamic, psychologically-grounded social simulations.

Abstract: Simulating nuanced human social dynamics with Large Language Models (LLMs)
remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving psychological depth
and consistent persona behavior crucial for high-fidelity training tools. This
paper introduces TACLA (Transactional Analysis Contextual LLM-based Agents), a
novel Multi-Agent architecture designed to overcome these limitations. TACLA
integrates core principles of Transactional Analysis (TA) by modeling agents as
an orchestrated system of distinct Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, each
with its own pattern memory. An Orchestrator Agent prioritizes ego state
activation based on contextual triggers and an agent's life script, ensuring
psychologically authentic responses. Validated in an educational scenario,
TACLA demonstrates realistic ego state shifts in Student Agents, effectively
modeling conflict de-escalation and escalation based on different teacher
intervention strategies. Evaluation shows high conversational credibility and
confirms TACLA's capacity to create dynamic, psychologically-grounded social
simulations, advancing the development of effective AI tools for education and
beyond.

*Rui Jerry Huang,Wendy Liu,Anastasia Miin*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AdCo introduces an adaptive UCB-based 'coopetition' framework for LLMs, improving reasoning performance without relying on high-performance verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of self-correction and MAC by enhancing coordination and reducing biases in LLM reasoning.

Method: UCB-based adaptive strategy where agents decide to collaborate or compete using coarse verifier signals and refine reasoning iteratively.

Result: Achieves 20% relative improvement on challenging datasets, maintaining robustness across sample sizes.

Conclusion: AdCo enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging diversity and uncertainty-driven exploration, advancing multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for
enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While
existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer
from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial
biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of
efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although
high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable
requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a
novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM
agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based "coopetition" mechanism. At each round,
agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or
compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without
relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves
significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a
20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our
approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different
sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided "coopetition"
framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge
diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven
exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From
this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation
and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is

TL;DR: The paper studies how physical scale and population size influence the emergence of complex behaviors in unsupervised ecological environments, focusing on reproduction, mutation, and natural selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how behaviors evolve naturally in large populations due to competition and environmental pressures, without explicit rewards or objectives.

Method: Conducted experiments in large-scale worlds with over 60,000 agents, each evolving neural network policies, observing behaviors like resource extraction and predation.

Result: Identified emergent behaviors dependent on environmental scale and population size, with larger scales increasing behavioral stability.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into using ecology for machine learning, leveraging computational resources to explore emergent behaviors.

Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of
complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents
are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but
instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural
selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population
around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single
high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve
across large populations due to natural competition and environmental
pressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we
conduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than
60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We
identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction,
vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival
pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the
emergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently
large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral
stability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in
evolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to
explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant
computational resources. Experimental code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multimodal Socialized Learning Framework (M-S2L) to enhance AI agents' social intelligence by combining multimodal perception and social learning. Evaluated in a Collaborative Assembly Environment, M-S2L outperforms baselines, showing improved communication and role specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop AI agents with human-like collaborative intelligence by integrating multimodal perception (vision and text) and social learning mechanisms.

Method: M-S2L integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) with social learning pathways: multimodal observational learning and communication-driven feedback learning. It uses episodic memory for long-term social context and is tested in a Collaborative Assembly Environment.

Result: M-S2L agents outperform Text-Only and No-Social-Learning baselines in task completion and efficiency, demonstrating advanced communication and problem-solving skills. Ablation studies highlight the importance of multimodality and social learning.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal perception with explicit social learning is crucial for developing collaborative intelligence in multi-agent systems, as shown by M-S2L's success.

Abstract: This search introduces the Multimodal Socialized Learning Framework (M-S2L),
designed to foster emergent social intelligence in AI agents by integrating
Multimodal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) with social learning mechanisms. The
framework equips agents with multimodal perception (vision and text) and
structured action capabilities, enabling physical manipulation and grounded
multimodal communication (e.g., text with visual pointers). M-S2L combines
direct reinforcement learning with two novel social learning pathways:
multimodal observational learning and communication-driven learning from
feedback, augmented by an episodic memory system for long-term social context.
  We evaluate M-S2L in a Collaborative Assembly Environment (CAE), where agent
teams must construct complex devices from ambiguous blueprints under
informational asymmetry. Across tasks of increasing complexity, M-S2L agents
consistently outperform Text-Only and No-Social-Learning baselines in Task
Completion Rate and Time to Completion, particularly in dynamic problem-solving
scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both multimodality and
socialized learning. Our analysis reveals the emergence of efficient
communication protocols integrating visual pointers with concise text,
alongside rapid role specialization leading to stable labor division.
Qualitative case studies demonstrate agents' abilities for shared awareness,
dynamic re-planning, and adaptive problem-solving, suggesting a nascent form of
machine social cognition. These findings indicate that integrating multimodal
perception with explicit social learning is critical for developing human-like
collaborative intelligence in multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven systems lack integration with foundational multi-agent research, leading to centralization and poor trust protocols.

Method: Introduces Fetch.ai, a decentralized platform combining blockchain for identity/discovery, secure agent development, cloud deployment, and AI-driven workflow orchestration.

Result: Demonstrated in a logistics use case where agents dynamically negotiate and transact securely.

Conclusion: Fetch.ai enables open, collaborative, and sustainable multi-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: Recent surges in LLM-driven intelligent systems largely overlook decades of
foundational multi-agent systems (MAS) research, resulting in frameworks with
critical limitations such as centralization and inadequate trust and
communication protocols. This paper introduces the Fetch.ai architecture, an
industrial-strength platform designed to bridge this gap by facilitating the
integration of classical MAS principles with modern AI capabilities. We present
a novel, multi-layered solution built on a decentralized foundation of on-chain
blockchain services for verifiable identity, discovery, and transactions. This
is complemented by a comprehensive development framework for creating secure,
interoperable agents, a cloud-based platform for deployment, and an intelligent
orchestration layer where an agent-native LLM translates high-level human goals
into complex, multi-agent workflows. We demonstrate the deployed nature of this
system through a decentralized logistics use case where autonomous agents
dynamically discover, negotiate, and transact with one another securely.
Ultimately, the Fetch.ai stack provides a principled architecture for moving
beyond current agent implementations towards open, collaborative, and
economically sustainable multi-agent ecosystems.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper bridges qualitative modeling and quantitative game theory to analyze strategic coopetition, formalizing interdependence and complementarity, validated through experiments and a joint venture case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between qualitative conceptual models (like i*) and quantitative game theory in analyzing strategic coopetition in socio-technical systems.

Method: Develops computational foundations for interdependence and complementarity, integrates structural dependencies with bargaining power, and uses game-theoretic Nash Equilibrium. Validated experimentally and applied to a joint venture.

Result: Logarithmic specifications achieve superior empirical fit (45/60 validation score) in the Samsung-Sony case, while power functions offer theoretical tractability.

Conclusion: Provides foundational groundwork for analyzing coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with broader research implications.

Abstract: Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition
where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture
it. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative
representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for
quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory
offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical
report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize
two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We
ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating
depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence
coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize
complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept,
modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We
integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation
and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates
structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental
testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications,
demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the
Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications
achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions
provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the
foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic
coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion
work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.
