Result: The abstract summarizes DR's benefits in enhancing downstream tasks like prediction and visualization in RS data. It also identifies under-explored DR algorithms for future research.

Conclusion: The review serves as a practical guide for applying DR techniques across the RS data value chain and highlights opportunities for advancing DR methods in future studies.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes are stealthy, neurally-generated fiducial markers that blend into environments for 6-DoF tracking, usable in AR, robotics, and more.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fiducial markers are visually intrusive; Ninja Codes aim to provide covert tracking without aesthetic disruption.

Method: An encoder network modifies images subtly to create Ninja Codes, trained alongside detection modules via deep steganography techniques.

Result: Experiments show reliable tracking under indoor lighting while blending into diverse textures.

Conclusion: Ninja Codes are promising for applications where conventional markers are too conspicuous.

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving improves accuracy by using multimodal LLMs, self-consistency ensembles, and contextual metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance high-level driving question-answering by leveraging carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding.

Method: Phase-1 uses a multimodal LLM with few-shot prompting and self-consistency ensembles. Phase-2 augments prompts with scene metadata and task-specific instructions.

Result: Achieves 67.37% overall accuracy, outperforming baselines, and maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption.

Conclusion: Engineered prompts and contextual grounding significantly boost QA performance in autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D is a novel state-space architecture for longitudinal medical imaging, efficiently modeling irregular time steps and spatio-temporal context, outperforming existing methods in breast cancer risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal analysis of radiological images faces challenges in modeling irregular time intervals and fully exploiting spatial-temporal cues, which current methods fail to address effectively.

Method: The proposed Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D integrates irregular time differences into state transitions and uses a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module for robust spatio-temporal relationships.

Result: The model improves validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieves higher AUC scores for 1-5 year predictions compared to recurrent, transformer, and state-space variants.

Conclusion: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D offers a computationally efficient and effective framework for longitudinal image analysis, particularly in breast cancer risk prediction.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a motion-centric alignment framework to improve text-to-video diffusion models by disentangling motion dynamics from video encoders, enhancing temporal coherence and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video diffusion models struggle with generating coherent and plausible motion due to insufficient understanding of complex dynamics.

Method: The authors propose aligning diffusion model features with a disentangled motion subspace learned from a pretrained video encoder, optimized for ground-truth optical flow prediction.

Result: The method enhances motion plausibility in generated videos while maintaining textual prompt adherence, validated by benchmarks and user studies.

Conclusion: The motion-centric alignment framework effectively improves video diffusion models, addressing limitations in motion coherence and physical realism.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh is a new metric for evaluating detailed image descriptions using scene graphs and LLMs-as-a-Judge, outperforming existing metrics and correlating better with human judgments. The DOCENT dataset validates PoSh and sets a challenging benchmark for VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fall short in evaluating detailed image descriptions, lacking sensitivity to attributes, relations, and localized errors. PoSh addresses this gap.

Method: PoSh uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing interpretable, fine-grained error scores. The DOCENT dataset provides expert references and human judgments for validation.

Result: PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman ρ) with human judgments than alternatives, is robust across image types, and serves as an effective reward function. Foundation models struggle with DOCENT's rich scene dynamics.

Conclusion: PoSh and DOCENT advance evaluation and benchmarking for detailed image description, highlighting challenges for VLMs and enabling progress in assistive text generation.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR is a unified Human Pose Representation pipeline aligning embeddings from images, 2D, and 3D poses using a novel singular value-based contrastive loss, achieving strong performance in Human Pose Estimation and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The correlation among various Human Pose representations lacks clear research, especially using contrastive learning. UniHPR addresses this gap by unifying embeddings from multiple modalities.

Method: Proposes UniHPR with a singular value-based contrastive learning loss to align embeddings from images, 2D, and 3D poses. Evaluated using 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation tasks.

Result: Achieves MPJPE 49.9mm on Human3.6M and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on 3DPW. Enables 2D/3D pose retrieval with MPJPE error of 9.24mm on Human3.6M.

Conclusion: UniHPR effectively aligns diverse Human Pose representations, demonstrating superior performance and versatility in downstream tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

*Eyad Gad,Seif Soliman,M. Saeed Darweesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study enhances brain tumor segmentation by integrating an attention mechanism into 3D U-Net and using a tumor detection algorithm to address class imbalance, achieving superior performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard U-Net models struggle with irregular tumor shapes and class imbalance in high-resolution MRI data, prompting the need for improved segmentation methods.

Method: The study proposes integrating an attention mechanism into 3D U-Net and employing a tumor detection algorithm to balance training data.

Result: The model achieved dice (0.975), specificity (0.988), and sensitivity (0.995) on the BraTS 2020 dataset, outperforming related studies.

Conclusion: The proposed model significantly improves brain tumor segmentation, aiding reliable clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

### [9] [A Novel Approach to Breast Cancer Segmentation using U-Net Model with Attention Mechanisms and FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19118)
*Eyad Gad,Mustafa Abou Khatwa,Mustafa A. Elattar,Sahar Selim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of training accurate and private AI models for breast cancer segmentation using Federated Learning (FL), specifically FedProx, on non-IID ultrasonic datasets. It achieves 96% accuracy with a modified U-Net model incorporating attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer are critical, but privacy concerns complicate AI model development. FL offers a privacy-preserving solution, but non-IID data affects model accuracy.

Method: The study applies FedProx to non-IID ultrasonic breast cancer datasets and enhances segmentation using a modified U-Net model with attention mechanisms.

Result: The global model achieved 96% accuracy, showing improved tumour segmentation while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: FedProx is effective for training precise models on non-IID medical data, balancing accuracy and privacy.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

### [10] [X-Ego: Acquiring Team-Level Tactical Situational Awareness via Cross-Egocentric Contrastive Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19150)
*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset for multi-agent decision-making in esports, and proposes Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) to enhance tactical awareness from individual perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in modeling synchronous, egocentric team interactions in sports and esports for multi-agent learning.

Method: Develops X-Ego-CS dataset with synchronized first-person perspectives and state-action trajectories, and proposes CECL to align teammates' visual streams for tactical awareness.

Result: CECL improves teammate and opponent location prediction from a single first-person view, demonstrating effectiveness with state-of-the-art video encoders.

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS and CECL provide foundational tools for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports, advancing spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Result: FootFormer achieves statistically significantly better or equivalent performance on multiple datasets and sets state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for stability-predictive components.

Conclusion: FootFormer demonstrates superior performance in estimating human motion dynamics and stability metrics, offering a promising tool for kinesiology applications.

Abstract: We propose FootFormer, a cross-modality approach for jointly predicting human
motion dynamics directly from visual input. On multiple datasets, FootFormer
achieves statistically significantly better or equivalent estimates of foot
pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as
compared with existing methods that generate one or two of those measures.
Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating
stability-predictive components (CoP, CoM, BoS) used in classic kinesiology
metrics. Code and data are available at

### [12] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models are applied to detect malaria in blood cell images, achieving high accuracy with Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet, reducing manual diagnosis errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual diagnosis of malaria is error-prone due to lack of expertise and human involvement, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Six deep convolutional networks (AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121, Custom-CNN) are tested on a public malaria cell image dataset.

Result: Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet perform best, achieving 97.28% and 97.55% accuracy, respectively.

Conclusion: Deep learning offers reliable, automated malaria detection, minimizing manual errors.

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

### [13] [PruneHal: Reducing Hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Adaptive KV Cache Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19183)
*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PruneHal, a training-free method leveraging adaptive KV cache pruning to mitigate hallucinations in multi-modal large language models by enhancing focus on critical visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) persist as a challenge due to insufficient attention to visual tokens and redundant visual tokens dispersing focus. Existing solutions add computational costs.

Method: PruneHal uses adaptive KV cache pruning to improve attention on informative visual tokens without extra training or inference costs. It is model-agnostic and integrates with various decoding strategies.

Result: Evaluated on hallucination benchmarks with four MLLMs, PruneHal achieved robust and outstanding results, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: PruneHal is a simple, effective, and low-cost solution for mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs, requiring no additional training and integrating seamlessly with existing methods.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

### [14] [Video Consistency Distance: Enhancing Temporal Consistency for Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Based Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19193)
*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric to improve temporal consistency in reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models for image-to-video generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward functions focus on overall video quality (aesthetic appeal, consistency) but often fail to address temporal consistency in image-to-video tasks.

Method: Proposes VCD, a frequency-space metric to capture frame features, and integrates it into a reward-based fine-tuning framework.

Result: Fine-tuning with VCD enhances temporal consistency significantly without compromising other performance metrics across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: VCD effectively addresses the temporal consistency limitation in video diffusion models, offering a robust solution for image-to-video generation.

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive enhances autonomous driving perception tasks by generating synthetic data via 3D-aware guidance maps and rendering, outperforming real-data-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on video generation quality but overlook downstream perception tasks, crucial for autonomous driving performance.

Method: Dream4Drive decomposes input videos into 3D-aware guidance maps, renders 3D assets onto them, and fine-tunes a driving world model for multi-view photorealistic video generation.

Result: Dream4Drive significantly improves corner case perception in autonomous driving and outperforms real-data-only baselines.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the value of synthetic data for enhancing perception tasks and introduces DriveObj3D, a large-scale 3D asset dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

### [16] [MoE-GS: Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19210)
*In-Hwan Jin,Hyeongju Mun,Joonsoo Kim,Kugjin Yun,Kyeongbo Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-GS integrates Mixture of Experts with Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scene reconstruction, improving rendering quality but at higher computational cost. Efficiency enhancements and distillation strategies are explored to mitigate trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic scene reconstruction struggle with consistency across diverse scenes, lacking a unified solution.

Method: MoE-GS uses a Volume-aware Pixel Router to blend outputs from specialized experts via differentiable weight splatting. Efficiency improvements include multi-expert rendering and gate-aware pruning, alongside distillation for lightweight deployment.

Result: MoE-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N3V and Technicolor datasets, demonstrating superior rendering quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: MoE-GS successfully addresses dynamic scene reconstruction challenges by leveraging Mixture of Experts and offers scalable solutions for efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

### [17] [SFGFusion: Surface Fitting Guided 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar and Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19215)
*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFGFusion is a novel camera-4D radar fusion network for 3D object detection, using surface fitting to enhance spatial representation and multi-modal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations of sparse radar point clouds and low resolution in 4D imaging radar for geometric representation and multi-modal fusion.

Method: SFGFusion estimates quadratic surface parameters from image and radar data to guide depth prediction, transforms image features to BEV, and generates dense pseudo-point clouds.

Result: SFGFusion achieves superior performance on TJ4DRadSet and VoD benchmarks by effectively fusing camera and 4D radar features.

Conclusion: SFGFusion enhances 3D object detection by improving spatial representation and multi-modal fusion, proving the effectiveness of surface fitting-guided methods.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method combining wavelet transform and Hungarian algorithm for detecting GEO satellites in optical images, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting GEO satellites is challenging due to weak signals and background noise.

Method: Wavelet transform enhances target features, and Hungarian algorithm optimizes multi-frame matching, followed by noise filtering and trajectory refinement.

Result: Achieved an F_1 score of 90.14% on SpotGEO dataset.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses GEO satellite detection challenges.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

*Yuheng Wu,Xiangbo Gao,Quang Tau,Zhengzhong Tu,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FadeLead improves collaborative perception by embedding background context into foreground features without transmitting the background, outperforming previous methods under bandwidth constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth limitations in vehicular networks make transmitting full feature maps impractical, and existing foreground-centric methods discard essential background context.

Method: FadeLearn uses curricular learning to progressively integrate background context into foreground features during training, avoiding direct transmission of background data.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks show FadeLead outperforms prior methods across various bandwidth settings.

Conclusion: FadeLead effectively enhances collaborative perception by encapsulating background context into compact foreground features, proving its superiority in bandwidth-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, focusing on representation selection for evolving 3D geometry with motion/interaction, highlighting key pillars (geometry, motion, interaction) and discussing current tools and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a distinctive perspective on 4D representations for evolving 3D geometry, focusing on selecting and customizing representations for tasks in computer graphics.

Method: Selective coverage of representative works, organizing 4D representations into geometry, motion, and interaction pillars, and discussing tools like NeRFs and 3DGS.

Result: Highlights desirable properties and challenges of 4D representations, identifies gaps in datasets, and explores the role of LLMs/VFMs.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of tailored 4D representations for tasks and calls attention to under-explored areas and dataset improvements.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

*Yun Kai Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Real-ISR framework using a ControlNet-mechanism-enhanced one-step diffusion model for better structural accuracy and perceptual quality, balancing efficiency and output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between perceptual quality and computational cost in Real-ISR, especially structural inaccuracies in one-step diffusion models.

Method: Enhances a one-step diffusion model with ControlNet for semantic edge guidance and uses a hybrid loss (L2, LPIPS, AME) for optimization.

Result: Improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining one-step inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework achieves a superior balance between output quality and speed, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

### [22] [MobiAct: Efficient MAV Action Recognition Using MobileNetV4 with Contrastive Learning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19273)
*Zhang Nengbo,Ho Hann Woei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobiAct is a lightweight MAV action recognition framework using MobileNetV4 and SOKD for efficient motion feature transfer, achieving high accuracy with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between recognition accuracy and speed in MAV motion recognition for resource-limited platforms.

Method: Uses MobileNetV4 as backbone, Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD), parameter-free attention, and hybrid loss training.

Result: Achieves 92.12% accuracy, 136.16 pJ energy, and 8.84 actions/second, decoding 2x faster than leading methods.

Conclusion: MobiAct offers superior efficiency and accuracy for MAV action recognition, suitable for resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

*Nobline Yoo,Olga Russakovsky,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a framework to enhance numeracy in text-to-image diffusion models by transforming non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on differentiable regression-based models for counting objects in generated images, limiting the use of superior but non-differentiable detector-based models.

Method: D2D converts detector logits into soft binary indicators via custom activation functions, enabling optimization of noise prior during inference.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show significant improvements in object counting accuracy (up to 13.7%) with minimal impact on image quality and computation.

Conclusion: D2D effectively bridges the gap between non-differentiable detectors and diffusion models, enhancing numeracy without compromising performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the

ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the impracticality of large-scale VLMs in resource-constrained environments by developing efficient training methods.

Method: Combines reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning, using an LLM-based discriminator and guidance from multiple teacher VLMs.

Result: RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art VLMs and surpasses them in some cases.

Conclusion: RIL enables lightweight VLMs to achieve competitive performance with large models, offering a practical solution for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

TL;DR: TS-GATR is a novel method combining Graph Attention Networks and GRUs for dynamic signature verification, outperforming state-of-the-art by modeling spatial-temporal dependencies effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High accuracy in signature verification is challenging due to intra-user variability and forgery risks, necessitating advanced methods like TS-GATR.

Method: TS-GATR uses GAT and GRU to model spatial-temporal dependencies, representing signatures as graphs with dynamic features and attention mechanisms. A DGATR module captures local and global spatial features, while GRU handles long-term temporal dependencies.

Result: TS-GATR achieves lower Equal Error Rates (EER) on benchmark datasets MSDS and DeepSignDB, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TS-GATR demonstrates superior performance in dynamic signature verification by integrating spatial-temporal modeling, making it a promising solution for identity authentication.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net is a unified multi-task framework for predicting bathymetry and seabed classification from remote sensing imagery, outperforming traditional methods and baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat bathymetry and seabed classification separately, missing synergistic benefits. Accurate, integrated shallow-water mapping is essential for under-mapped environments facing climatological and anthropogenic pressures.

Method: Seabed-Net uses dual-branch encoders for bathymetry and seabed classification, integrates cross-task features with Attention Feature Fusion and Swin-Transformer fusion blocks, and balances objectives dynamically.

Result: Seabed-Net reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30% and improves seabed classification accuracy by up to 8% compared to baselines, with enhanced spatial consistency and habitat boundaries.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling depth and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, providing a robust solution for shallow-water mapping.

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Method: Conduct systematic examinations, create ScaleBench, reproduce 20 DG algorithms, perform theoretical analysis, and propose Catto for mitigation.

Result: Limitations of existing DG algorithms are revealed, and Catto effectively addresses scale shift challenges, providing insights for future research.

Conclusion: Scale shift significantly impacts crowd localization in DG settings, and Catto offers a promising solution, highlighting the need for further exploration in Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

### [30] [BrainMCLIP: Brain Image Decoding with Multi-Layer feature Fusion of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19332)
*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP introduces a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach for decoding fMRI images, leveraging CLIP's intermediate layers and aligning with the brain's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for a VAE pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook rich object information in CLIP's intermediate layers and contradict the brain's hierarchical structure, requiring resource-intensive VAE pathways.

Method: BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from distinct visual areas to corresponding CLIP layers, uses Cross-Reconstruction and multi-granularity loss.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with 71.7% fewer parameters than VAE-based methods, excelling in high-level semantic metrics.

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP balances semantic accuracy and detail fidelity efficiently without a VAE pipeline.

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

### [31] [A Training-Free Framework for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation and Recognition with EfficientNet and CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19333)
*Ying Dai,Wei Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition using EfficientNetB0 and CLIP, achieving top results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition without requiring labeled training data, leveraging unsupervised learning and vision-language alignment.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: unsupervised segmentation via hierarchical clustering of EfficientNetB0 features, followed by recognition using CLIP's vision-language alignment with adaptive clustering.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC benchmarks in mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, flexible, and generalizable for open-vocabulary tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DaMo, a data mixture optimizer, enhances MLLM performance for multitask mobile phone scenarios by predicting optimal data mixtures, achieving significant improvements on benchmarks like PhoneAgentBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with multitask handling in mobile phone scenarios, and current multitask SFT methods lack optimal data composition strategies.

Method: Proposes DaMo, a trainable network predicting optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for given dataset ratios, evaluated on PhoneAgentBench and other benchmarks.

Result: DaMo improves performance by 3.38% on PhoneAgentBench, generalizes well (2.57% average improvement), and scales effectively (12.47% improvement on BFCL-v3).

Conclusion: DaMo effectively addresses multitask learning challenges in MLLMs, demonstrating robust performance and scalability across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARE is a deformable medical image registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic regularization to balance stability and flexibility, integrating a folding-prevention mechanism for anatomically plausible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based methods often neglect regularization's role in robustness and anatomical plausibility.

Method: DARE dynamically adjusts elastic regularization based on deformation field gradients, integrates strain and shear energy terms, and includes a folding-prevention mechanism.

Result: DARE improves registration accuracy, avoids over-smoothing, and ensures anatomically plausible transformations.

Conclusion: DARE effectively addresses the limitations of current methods by combining adaptive regularization and folding prevention.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

*Woo Jae Kim,Kyu Beom Han,Yoonki Cho,Youngju Na,Junsik Jung,Sooel Son,Sung-eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AegisRF introduces adversarial perturbations to protect Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from unauthorized use, balancing disruption of downstream tasks with rendering quality preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting NeRFs' intellectual property from unauthorized applications is crucial, but existing methods avoid geometric perturbations due to quality degradation risks.

Method: AegisRF uses a Perturbation Field to inject adversarial perturbations and a Sensitivity Field to adaptively constrain these perturbations, preserving rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use.

Result: The framework shows generalized applicability across tasks like multi-view image classification and 3D localization while maintaining visual fidelity.

Conclusion: AegisRF effectively protects NeRFs' IP without compromising rendering quality, demonstrating broad utility.

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

TL;DR: MV-RoboBench is introduced to evaluate multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation, revealing gaps compared to human performance and challenges in leveraging multi-view inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored, despite multi-camera setups being standard in robotics.

Method: A benchmark called MV-RoboBench is created with 1.7k curated QA items across eight subtasks, testing spatial understanding and robotic execution. Diverse VLMs, including enhanced versions with CoT-inspired techniques, are evaluated.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below humans in multi-view robotic perception. Spatial intelligence and robotic execution are positively correlated, and single-view benchmarks do not reliably predict robotic task success.

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench highlights challenges in multi-view robotic reasoning and aims to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs with standardized evaluation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores a method to track warehouse workers using multiple wide-angle cameras to improve efficiency, achieving over 20% better tracking accuracy by aligning foot positions to reduce distortion effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of e-commerce necessitates efficient warehouse operations, prompting the exploration of digital twins for accurate worker tracking.

Method: Used 19 wide-angle ceiling cameras to track workers, aligning detected positions based on foot positions to mitigate distortions from wide-angle lenses.

Result: Achieved a more than 20% improvement in tracking accuracy and validated the effectiveness of the proposed alignment approach.

Conclusion: The study successfully enhanced worker tracking in warehouses by addressing wide-angle camera distortions, supporting the feasibility of digital twins for logistics optimization.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PICK, a multi-step framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for psychoanalytical image comprehension, specifically targeting the House-Tree-Person Test, and demonstrates its effectiveness in psychological analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs excel in objective multimodal tasks but lack exploration in subjective, emotionally nuanced domains like psychological analysis. PICK aims to bridge this gap.

Method: PICK decomposes drawings into hierarchical sub-drawings, analyzes them at single-object, multi-object, and whole levels, and uses a knowledge base and feature extraction module for psychological profiling.

Result: PICK significantly enhances MLLMs' capability in psychological analysis, validated through experiments and extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: PICK provides a structured, interpretable framework for psychoanalytical image comprehension, successfully integrating MLLMs into specialized expert domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in IC defect classification due to highly imbalanced data and domain complexities, introducing the IC-Defect-14 dataset and ReCAME-Net, a novel classifier framework that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world IC defect classification faces unique challenges like extreme data skew and mixed feature complexities, which existing models fail to address effectively.

Method: Proposes ReCAME-Net, combining regional channel attention, metric learning, hard category mining, and knowledge distillation within a multi-expert framework.

Result: ReCAME-Net achieves superior performance on the IC-Defect-14 dataset and remains competitive on general public datasets.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset and ReCAME-Net offer a robust solution for real-world IC defect classification, addressing key challenges unmet by current approaches.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

*Ali Sadeghkhani,Brandon Bennett,Masoud Babaei,Arash Rabbani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-conditional GAN framework generates representative pore-scale images with controlled properties, addressing challenges in subsurface characterization and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of obtaining representative pore-scale images due to natural heterogeneity and data scarcity motivates the development of a solution.

Method: A multi-conditional GAN framework was trained on thin section samples, conditioning on porosity and depth parameters to generate representative images.

Result: The model achieved high porosity control (R^2=0.95) and preserved critical pore network characteristics, outperforming randomly extracted real sub-images.

Conclusion: The framework provides transformative tools for subsurface characterization, especially useful for carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management.

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

TL;DR: A novel framework leverages AI-generated predictive imaging to accelerate MRI by using predicted contrast images as data-driven priors for reconstructing under-sampled data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput, prompting the development of a predictive imaging framework to enhance speed and efficiency.

Method: The framework predicts target contrast images using generative models conditioned on diverse data sources, then uses these predictions as priors for reconstructing under-sampled MRI data.

Result: Evaluated on over 14,921 scans, the method significantly outperforms traditional approaches at high acceleration factors (x4, x8, x12).

Conclusion: The study introduces a paradigm shift from image reconstruction to predictive imaging, demonstrating superior performance and clinical potential.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

TL;DR: PRGCN introduces a novel framework for monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging cross-sequence pattern reuse through a graph memory bank and hybrid architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the inherent depth ambiguity in monocular 3D pose estimation by exploiting structural regularities and repetitive motion patterns across sequences, a limitation overlooked by current methods.

Method: PRGCN uses a graph memory bank to store pose prototypes retrieved via attention, fused with anatomical constraints via memory-driven graph convolution. It combines Mamba-based state-space models for local temporal modeling and self-attention for global relations.

Result: PRGCN achieves MPJPE of 37.1mm on Human3.6M and 13.4mm on MPI-INF-3DHP, setting new benchmarks and showing strong cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal for advancing 3D pose estimation, shifting the focus from per-sequence optimization to cumulative knowledge learning.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

Motivation: Missing pixels in satellite images (MNAR) can bias models, leading to under-detection of methane plumes in low-coverage images.

Method: Evaluates imputation approaches and proposes a weighted resampling scheme to balance class labels across coverage bins.

Result: Both methods reduce bias without compromising accuracy, precision, or recall. Debiased models perform better in operational scenarios.

Conclusion: Debiasing techniques enhance plume detection in low-coverage images, improving model reliability.

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

### [43] [Towards Single-Source Domain Generalized Object Detection via Causal Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19487)
*Chen Li,Huiying Xu,Changxin Gao,Zeyu Wang,Yun Liu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary: SDGOD focuses on improving model generalization in unseen domains using single-source training. Existing methods struggle with spurious correlations, but Cauvis, leveraging cross-attention prompts and dual-branch adapters, outperforms current approaches by 15.9-31.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current domain generalization methods, which suffer from spurious correlations due to domain shifts and limited domain knowledge.

Method: Cauvis introduces a Cross-Attention Prompts module to reduce bias from spurious features and a dual-branch adapter to disentangle causal-spurious features and adapt domains via high-frequency feature extraction.

Result: Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating 15.9-31.4% improvements over existing methods and robustness in complex environments.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights Cauvis's effectiveness in enhancing generalization and robustness, outperforming current domain generalization techniques.

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

*Moshe Kimhi,Nimrod Shabtay,Raja Giryes,Chaim Baskin,Eli Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARES is a lightweight module that predicts the minimal sufficient image resolution for VLMs, reducing compute and latency while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution images inflate visual tokens to 97-99% of total tokens in VLMs, causing unnecessary compute and latency even when lower resolutions suffice.

Method: CARES uses a compact VLM to extract features and predict the minimal sufficient resolution for a target VLM's response convergence.

Result: CARES reduces compute by up to 80% across five multimodal benchmarks while preserving task performance.

Conclusion: CARES effectively balances resolution and compute overhead, enhancing efficiency in VLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

*Qing Mao,Tianxin Huang,Yu Zhu,Jinqiu Sun,Yanning Zhang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseCrafter improves camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping images by combining synthetic intermediate frames and a feature-based selection method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with small or no overlap in image pairs, leading to blurry frames and inefficiency in pose estimation.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) for clearer intermediate frames and a Feature Matching Selector (FMS) for optimal frame selection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets like Cambridge Landmarks and ScanNet, especially for low-overlap cases.

Conclusion: PoseCrafter effectively addresses challenges in pose estimation for sparsely overlapping images.

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

*Simone Alghisi,Gabriel Roccabruna,Massimo Rizzoli,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with visual reasoning tasks like counting, spatial relations, and temporal sequences. This paper investigates failure causes and improves reasoning by fine-tuning the output layer, boosting accuracy by 21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs show limitations in visual reasoning despite strong performance on downstream tasks. Understanding and addressing these weaknesses can enhance their capabilities.

Method: The study analyzes seven VLMs' counting abilities under controlled conditions, identifies failure causes, and proposes fine-tuning the output layer for improvement.

Result: VLMs are sensitive to object number, type, spatial arrangement, and distractors. Fine-tuning the output layer increases accuracy by up to 21%.

Conclusion: Targeted training of the output layer effectively improves VLMs' visual reasoning, validated by consistent gains on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

### [47] [The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19557)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Aaron Courville,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic impact of prompt complexity on synthetic data's utility (quality, diversity, consistency) is explored, revealing trade-offs and the effectiveness of prompt expansion for improving diversity and aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how prompt complexity affects synthetic data utility (quality, diversity, consistency) is crucial for leveraging T2I models effectively.

Method: Synthetic experiments, theoretical derivations, and large-scale empirical analysis across datasets (CC12M, ImageNet-1k, DCI) with various inference-time interventions.

Result: Higher prompt complexity reduces conditional diversity and prompt consistency but narrows the synthetic-to-real distribution gap. Prompt expansion outperforms other interventions in diversity and aesthetics.

Conclusion: Prompt expansion enhances synthetic data utility, emphasizing the need for careful prompt design to optimize T2I model outputs.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the temporal awareness of vision-language models (VLMs) using a new dataset (TIME10k) and methodology, revealing structured temporal information in VLM embeddings and proposing efficient timeline representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance the temporal reasoning capabilities of large-scale VLMs like CLIP, which currently lack explicit temporal awareness.

Method: Introduces TIME10k benchmark, evaluates 37 VLMs, and proposes methods to derive explicit timeline representations from embeddings.

Result: Temporal information in VLMs follows a low-dimensional manifold, enabling competitive or superior performance in temporal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The study advances VLM capabilities for temporal tasks, offering efficient timeline representations and open-sourcing tools for further research.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

*Yao Deng,Xian Zhong,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu,Jingling Yuan,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation (HAD) to combine RGB and event cameras' strengths for improved object tracking, addressing their spatio-temporal asymmetries through hierarchical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB and event cameras have complementary strengths (high spatial vs. temporal resolution), but their inherent asymmetries hinder multi-modal integration.

Method: HAD introduces hierarchical alignment to mitigate asymmetries while maintaining efficiency and compactness.

Result: HAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: HAD effectively combines RGB and event camera data, enhancing object tracking in challenging conditions.

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

*Ariana Yi,Ce Zhou,Liyang Xiao,Qiben Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: α-Cloak is the first no-box adversarial attack targeting object detectors via RGBA videos' alpha channel, achieving 100% success rate without perceptible artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring security of object detection models in cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, surveillance) against adversarial threats, especially unexplored video-domain attacks in no-box settings.

Method: Exploits the alpha channel to fuse malicious and benign videos, creating stealthy attacks that fool detectors without human-noticeable changes.

Result: Achieved 100% success rate across five object detectors, a vision-language model, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, showing compatibility with common video formats.

Conclusion: Reveals a critical vulnerability in video-based perception systems, emphasizing the need for defenses addressing alpha channel threats.

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

*Junhong Lin,Kangli Wang,Shunzhou Wang,Songlin Fan,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGD is a feed-forward framework improving surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction by leveraging geometric learning and semantic refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in ensuring generalization and novel view quality in surround-view scenes with minimal overlap regions.

Method: VGD uses a lightweight VGGT variant for geometric priors, a Gaussian Head for novel view rendering, and integrates multi-scale features for semantic refinement.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show VGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics and subjective quality.

Conclusion: VGD validates scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction through feature-consistent learning.

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal co-learning framework for Earth Observation tasks, improving single-modality predictions by leveraging diverse sensor data during training without requiring the same modalities at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world constraints limit access to the same sensor modalities during training and inference in Earth Observation, creating a need for adaptable multi-modal learning.

Method: The framework uses contrastive and modality discriminative learning to separate modality-shared and modality-specific information.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four EO benchmarks, showing consistent predictive improvements.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generalizes across tasks and modalities, validating its use in single-modality inference scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing seamless, artifact-free fused images and bridging synthetic-real-world gaps.

Conclusion: VAEEDOF advances MFIF by addressing key challenges, offering robust fusion across diverse focus points.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from

utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on

*Zhou Lei,Pan Gang,Wang Jiahao,Sun Di*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDiff introduces a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model for Image Forgery Localization, generating diverse localization maps to improve reliability and address uncertainty in tampered regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precision and reliability for high-stakes applications, necessitating a more credible and comprehensive approach.

Method: CBDiff uses Bernoulli noise in diffusion and Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention) to enhance forgery mask representation and detection.

Result: CBDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods across eight benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: CBDiff offers improved reliability and potential for real-world deployment in image forensics.

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

*Haozhe Luo,Shelley Zixin Shu,Ziyu Zhou,Sebastian Otalora,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the grounding ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medical image understanding, focusing on chest X-rays. It benchmarks seven VLM variants, revealing limitations in localization for small lesions and improved performance with domain-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the grounding ability of VLMs in medical imaging is crucial for clinical interpretability and adoption, yet it remains underexplored.

Method: The study uses cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps to generate visual explanations, comparing them with radiologist annotations across pathologies.

Result: VLMs perform well for large pathologies but poorly for small/diffuse lesions. Domain-specific pretraining improves alignment, and grounding ability correlates with recognition performance.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack clinically reliable grounding, emphasizing the need for interpretability benchmarks before medical deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition

### [58] [Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612)
*Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Stéphane Mallat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a denoising estimator using scattering coefficients, extending sparse signal representation methods to adapt to complex signal regularities like cartoon images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse estimators in frames are insufficient for adapting to complex signal regularities, prompting exploration of deep convolutional neural networks and simplified models like wavelet scattering coefficients.

Method: Introduces a denoising estimator by jointly minimizing and maximizing ℓ¹ norms of subsets of scattering coefficients, capturing geometric image regularity.

Result: Numerical experiments show the estimator achieves minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images across Lipschitz exponents α ≤ 2.

Conclusion: The approach bridges harmonic analysis with deep convolutional networks, offering a new method for noise suppression and geometric regularity specification.

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

*Junfei Zhou,Penglin Dai,Quanmin Wei,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenComm introduces a Generative Communication mechanism for seamless perception in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, avoiding retraining and enabling lightweight integration of new agents with reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome domain gaps in multi-agent collaboration caused by heterogeneous sensors/models without intrusive retraining or high computational costs.

Method: Uses a Deformable Message Extractor for spatial messages, a Spatial-Aware Feature Generator (conditional diffusion model), and a Channel Enhancer for feature refinement.

Result: Achieves 81% reduction in computational cost and parameter count while outperforming state-of-the-art methods on OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X, and V2X-Real datasets.

Conclusion: GenComm provides a scalable, efficient solution for heterogeneous multi-agent collaboration with minimal disruption.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

### [60] [Augmenting Moment Retrieval: Zero-Dependency Two-Stage Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19622)
*Zhengxuan Wei,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR is a zero-external-dependency Augmented Moment Retrieval framework addressing data scarcity, boundary ambiguity, and semantic discrimination bottlenecks in existing methods. It leverages augmented data and a two-stage training process for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from data scarcity, boundary ambiguity, and insufficient semantic discrimination, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: AMR uses augmented data and a two-stage training framework (cold-start and distillation stages) with dual query sets and cross-stage distillation loss.

Result: AMR outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMR effectively addresses key bottlenecks in Moment Retrieval, enhancing performance without additional manual labeling.

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

*Yifan Li,Fenghe Tang,Yingtai Li,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning for disease diagnosis, addressing limitations of general-purpose VLMs in the medical domain by leveraging a new dataset (CT-RATE-VQA) and a novel zoom-in strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs underperform in medical tasks due to lack of specialized datasets and neglect of diagnostic processes. The paper aims to improve medical VLMs by addressing these gaps.

Method: Constructed CT-RATE-VQA dataset (84K QA pairs). Proposed MedReason-R1 with zoom-in disease ROI strategy and GRPO reinforcement learning framework for reasoning.

Result: MedReason-R1 outperforms recent general-purpose and medical VLMs in CT disease diagnosis while maintaining generalization.

Conclusion: MedReason-R1 sets a new benchmark for medical VLMs by integrating explicit reasoning and leveraging specialized datasets.

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

### [62] [Re-Activating Frozen Primitives for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19653)
*Yuxin Cheng,Binxiao Huang,Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Graziano Chesi,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS addresses over-reconstruction artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) by introducing an importance-aware densification criterion and a re-activation mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies gradient magnitude dilution and the primitive frozen phenomenon as key limitations causing artifacts in 3D-GS.

Method: ReAct-GS uses an importance-aware densification criterion and adaptive parameter perturbations to re-activate stalled Gaussian growth.

Result: ReAct-GS eliminates artifacts, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and preserves geometric details while being adaptable to other variants.

Conclusion: The introduced re-activation mechanism improves 3D-GS performance and demonstrates broad applicability.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

### [63] [From Forecasting to Planning: Policy World Model for Collaborative State-Action Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19654)
*Zhida Zhao,Talas Fu,Yifan Wang,Lijun Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Policy World Model (PWM), a unified framework integrating world modeling and trajectory planning for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance with front-camera-only input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between world modeling and trajectory planning in autonomous systems by leveraging synergies between the two.

Method: PWM combines world modeling and planning, uses action-free future state forecasting, and features a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism.

Result: PWM matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods despite using only front-camera input.

Conclusion: PWM demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating world modeling and planning, offering a human-like anticipatory perception for reliable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

*John Burden,Jonathan Prunty,Ben Slater,Matthieu Tehenan,Greg Davis,Lucy Cheke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using visual search paradigms inspired by cognitive psychology to assess human-like perceptual capabilities like the 'pop-out' effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box evaluations of MLLMs focus on task accuracy but fail to reveal underlying visual processing mechanisms. The study aims to bridge this gap by adapting cognitive psychology methods.

Method: Classic visual search paradigms are adapted to test MLLMs for the 'pop-out' effect and capacity limits in disjunctive (single feature) and conjunctive (multiple feature) searches. Controlled experiments target color, size, and lighting features.

Result: Advanced MLLMs exhibit human-like pop-out effects in color or size-based searches and show capacity limits in conjunctive searches. They also incorporate natural scene priors like lighting direction into object representations.

Conclusion: Visual search serves as a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs, revealing human-like behaviors and limitations.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

*Zihao Chen,Yi Zhou,Xudong Jiang,Li Chen,Leopold Schmetterer,Bingyao Tan,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CST preserves curvilinear structures in unpaired medical image translation, enhancing fidelity and diagnostic reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods distort fine structures like microvasculature, which is critical in medical imaging.

Method: CST integrates structure consistency via a curvilinear extraction module, compatible with models like CycleGAN and UNSB.

Result: CST improves translation fidelity across three imaging modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CST provides a principled approach for structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Ensemble-CAM, a novel technique for providing visual explanations in DL-based face PAD systems to enhance transparency and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Presentation attacks threaten security, and while DL models detect them effectively, their opaque decisions hinder user trust and understanding.

Method: The paper introduces Ensemble-CAM, a visual explanation technique for DL-based face PAD systems.

Result: Ensemble-CAM improves understanding of DL model behavior by highlighting key regions in biometric images that influence decisions.

Conclusion: Visual explanations like Ensemble-CAM enhance transparency and trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

TL;DR: LyTimeT is a two-phase framework for extracting interpretable dynamical variables from high-dimensional videos, using spatio-temporal attention and stability constraints to achieve robust and accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of extracting true dynamical variables from high-dimensional videos despite visual distractions like background motion and occlusions.

Method: Phase 1: Uses a TimeSformer-based autoencoder with global attention to learn latent states robust to distractions. Phase 2: Selects meaningful dimensions via linear correlation and refines dynamics with Lyapunov-based stability regularization.

Result: Achieves superior mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates, remains invariant under perturbations, and outperforms CNN-based and transformer-only baselines in analytical mean squared error.

Conclusion: Combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints produces accurate and interpretable predictive models.

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: ADQ is a mixed-precision quantization framework addressing non-uniform activation distributions and static weight codebooks in QAT, achieving superior accuracy with low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT methods struggle with non-uniform activation distributions and mismatched weight codebooks, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: ADQ introduces adaptive weight quantization with quantile-based initialization, EMA-based codebook adaptation, and sensitivity-informed mixed-precision allocation, plus a non-uniform-to-uniform mapping for activations.

Result: ADQ achieves 71.512% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-18 at 2.81 bits, outperforming benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Conclusion: ADQ effectively addresses QAT challenges through adaptive strategies, demonstrating practical superiority in low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve zero-shot generalization in VLMs under distribution shifts by tackling prototype degradation and class confusion.

Method: Uses Class-Aware Prototype Cache Module and Negative Contrastive Learning Mechanism for dynamic class adjustment and better separability.

Result: Outperforms previous TTA methods on 15 benchmarks across ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: CPL-NC effectively enhances generalization in VLMs by addressing key challenges in TTA.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Motivation: To address the lack of standardization and understanding of evaluation metrics in monocular depth estimation.

Method: Quantitative analysis of existing metrics' sensitivity to perturbations, comparison to human judgment, and introduction of a new metric.

Result: Existing metrics are insensitive to curvature perturbations, prompting the creation of a new metric and visualization tools.

Conclusion: The proposed metric and tools improve human alignment and provide a better evaluation framework.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks that reflect real-world challenges like motion complexity and occlusion patterns in point tracking.

Method: ITTO uses videos from existing datasets and egocentric recordings, with high-quality human annotations, to analyze state-of-the-art trackers.

Result: Existing trackers struggle, especially with re-identifying points after occlusion, exposing critical failure modes.

Conclusion: ITTO highlights the need for new modeling approaches and serves as a foundation for developing more robust tracking algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking
algorithms.

*Daniel Vollmers,Hamada M. Zahera,Diego Moussallem,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified fine-tuned model integrates entity recognition and disambiguation, leveraging large language models for enriched context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-step methods for entity linking are computationally intensive and less effective.

Method: Proposes a fine-tuned model integrating entity recognition and disambiguation in one framework and uses large language models for context enrichment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, especially for out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: The unified framework with enriched context outperforms traditional methods.

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural
language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process
with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified
framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich
the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity
disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared
with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using MiniLMs for precise, efficient, and cost-effective information retrieval from geoscience literature, addressing biases and costs of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as information biases and high computational costs, by leveraging smaller, freely available models (MiniLMs) for domain-specific tasks in geoscience.

Method: Developed a framework using MiniLMs and semantic search techniques on a curated corpus of 77 million sentences from 95 geoscience journals (2000-2024), enabling efficient sentence-level indexing and retrieval.

Result: MiniLMs outperformed LLMs like ChatGPT-4 in extracting expert-verified, domain-specific information, particularly quantitative findings, while also enabling sentiment analysis and topical clustering for tracking research trends.

Conclusion: MiniLMs offer significant potential for geoscience applications, including fact retrieval, trend analysis, contradiction detection, and education, due to their computational efficiency and precision.

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

*Richard J. Young,Brandon Gillins,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A streamlined framework with twenty prompts evaluates LLM instruction-following across diverse tasks, tested on 256 models to identify failure modes and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focused, quick diagnostic tools for assessing LLM instruction adherence amid potential benchmark memorization.

Method: Compact test suite of twenty carefully designed prompts targeting format, content, logic, and multi-step tasks, tested on 256 models.

Result: Identified consistent failure modes and challenging instruction types across major and emerging LLM providers.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, efficient tool for evaluating LLM instruction-following and comprehensive empirical insights.

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

*Mangsura Kabir Oni,Tabia Tanzin Prama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models outperforms zero-shot LLMs in Bengali-to-Sylheti translation, emphasizing task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in MT, low-resource languages like Sylheti remain underexplored. This work aims to bridge this gap by comparing fine-tuned models with LLMs.

Method: The study fine-tunes multilingual Transformer models (like mBART-50 and MarianMT) and evaluates them against zero-shot LLMs for Bengali-to-Sylheti translation.

Result: Fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with mBART-50 excelling in translation adequacy and MarianMT in character-level fidelity.

Conclusion: Task-specific adaptation is crucial for underrepresented languages, supporting inclusive language technology development.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

*Shriyansh Agrawal,Aidan Lau,Sanyam Shah,Ahan M R,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs outperform LLMs for binary classification of machine-generated content, offering high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detectors for machine-generated content are either computationally expensive or insufficiently accurate.

Method: Fine-tuned encoder-only SLMs (RoBERTA and CodeBERTa) using specialized datasets for binary classification.

Result: Achieved AUROC = 0.97 to 0.99 and macro-F1 0.89 to 0.94 with reduced latency and VRAM usage.

Conclusion: SLMs provide superior performance and efficiency for detecting machine-generated content.

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [79] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase uses LLMs to rephrase social media texts for better topic modeling, improving coherence, uniqueness, and diversity while reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media texts are brief and noisy, hindering traditional topic modeling's effectiveness. TM-Rephrase aims to address this by standardizing language.

Method: TM-Rephrase applies general- and colloquial-to-formal rephrasing strategies to tweets before topic modeling, tested on 25,027 COVID-19-related posts.

Result: The framework improves topic modeling metrics, with colloquial-to-formal strategy showing the best results, especially for LDA.

Conclusion: TM-Rephrase offers a model-agnostic solution to enhance topic modeling in public health social media analysis, aiding better discourse understanding.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

*Hongyi He,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Mingni Tang,Yi Cheng,Jintao Wang,Wenjie Li,Peng Cheng,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ODiS algorithm ensures quality and diversity in pre-training data selection by decomposing correlated metrics into orthogonal dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing score-based data selection methods degrade performance due to collapsing correlated dimensions, overlooking diversity.

Method: ODiS evaluates data across multiple dimensions, decorrelates scores via PCA, trains scorers, and selects top-scored data per orthogonal dimension.

Result: ODiS-selected data shows <2% inter-dimension overlap, and models trained with it outperform baselines.

Conclusion: Orthogonal diversity-aware data selection is crucial for LLMs, achieving better downstream performance.

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

### [81] [Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic, reversible pruning framework to address biases in large language models by adapting neuron activations contextually during generation, offering real-time fairness control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit undesirable behaviors like bias and inconsistency, which are hard to mitigate post-deployment. Current methods are static and inflexible, prompting the need for a dynamic solution.

Method: A dynamic pruning-based framework detects context-aware neuron activations and uses adaptive masking to modulate their influence during generation, preserving knowledge and coherence.

Result: The framework enables fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation, improving fairness and coherence in multilingual and multi-turn dialogues.

Conclusion: The proposed inference-time solution offers adaptable and reversible bias mitigation, enhancing fairness control in conversational AI.

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMAO-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating uni-modal and omni-modal understanding in multimodal large language models, revealing performance correlations and bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the correlation between uni-modal and omni-modal understanding and drive the evolution of omni models.

Method: Proposes MMAO-Bench, a benchmark with 1880 human-curated samples across 44 task types, including a multi-step open-ended question type for complex reasoning.

Result: Shows compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and identifies omni-modal capability as a bottleneck for weak models but synergistic for strong models.

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench effectively evaluates multimodal models, highlighting performance trends and limitations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an explainable and efficient pipeline using transformer-based models (RoBERTa and DistilBERT) for misinformation detection, showing comparable accuracy with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat the spread of misinformation online by developing a trustworthy and scalable detection method.

Method: A two-step fine-tuning strategy for PLMs (freezing the backbone first, then progressively unfreezing with layer-wise learning rate decay), with LIME and SHAP for explainability.

Result: DistilBERT achieves accuracy similar to RoBERTa while using fewer computational resources. The pipeline provides faithful local (token-level) and global explanations.

Conclusion: Lightweight PLMs with principled fine-tuning and interpretability tools offer an effective framework for scalable misinformation detection.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method using signed character networks to evaluate LLM story generation, revealing biases toward positive, tightly-knit relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human assessments of LLM creativity are hard to scale; this study aims to provide a scalable alternative by analyzing social structures in narratives.

Method: The methodology involves analyzing signed character networks from 1,200+ stories generated by four LLMs and human writers, focusing on network properties like density and clustering.

Result: LLM-generated stories show a consistent bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships, aligning with prior human-assessed findings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a valuable tool for assessing creative storytelling tendencies in LLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

*Howard Yen,Ashwin Paranjape,Mengzhou Xia,Thejas Venkatesh,Jack Hessel,Danqi Chen,Yuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIM improves long-horizon agentic search by separating retrieval tools and periodic summarization, achieving better performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks struggle with long trajectories due to context limitations, prompting the need for a scalable solution.

Method: SLIM introduces distinct search and browse tools with periodic summarization to maintain concise context.

Result: SLIM outperforms baselines by 8-4 points, reduces tool calls by 4-6x, and has fewer hallucinations.

Conclusion: SLIM's design and analysis framework provide insights for future long-horizon agents.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

TL;DR: ProfBench introduces a dataset of 7000 expert-evaluated response-criterion pairs to evaluate LLMs in professional domains, addressing gaps in current assessment methods. It also proposes cost-effective LLM-Judges, revealing challenges for top models like GPT-5-high and disparities between proprietary and open models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations are limited to tasks like math and short-form QA, neglecting professional document processing and report generation. ProfBench aims to fill this gap.

Method: ProfBench uses over 7000 expert-evaluated response-criterion pairs across physics, chemistry, finance, and consulting. It develops LLM-Judges to reduce evaluation costs by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Result: Top models like GPT-5-high achieve only 65.9% performance on ProfBench, highlighting challenges. Disparities exist between proprietary and open-weight models, with extended thinking being crucial for complex tasks.

Conclusion: ProfBench provides a robust benchmark for LLMs in professional domains, revealing limitations and insights into model performance disparities.

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights
into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex,

### [87] [Dynamic Evaluation for Oversensitivity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19005)
*Sophia Xiao Pu,Sitao Cheng,Xin Eric Wang,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OVERBENCH, a dynamic benchmark addressing oversensitivity in language models by generating model-specific datasets to evaluate defensive behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of static benchmarks that degrade over time and fail to capture evolving defensive patterns in language models.

Method: Develops a framework for dynamically generating challenging datasets tailored to each model's behavior, culminating in OVERBENCH with 450,000 samples from 25 models.

Result: OVERBENCH provides a continuous, evolving evaluation of oversensitivity, identifying vulnerabilities missed by static datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic benchmarks like OVERBENCH are essential for monitoring and understanding oversensitivity as language models evolve.

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' social reasoning capabilities in understanding interpersonal relationships, emphasizing the need for socially-aware models.

Method: Used SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset annotated with relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) in English and Korean, evaluating nine models.

Result: Proprietary LLMs scored 75-80% in English but only 58-69% in Korean, with notable errors in selecting Unlikely relationships (10-25%). Chain-of-thought prompting offered minimal benefits and sometimes amplified biases.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show significant limitations in social reasoning, underscoring the need for improved socially-aware language models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

*Abeer Badawi,Elahe Rahimi,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Sheri Grach,Lindsay Bertrand,Lames Danok,Jimmy Huang,Frank Rudzicz,Elham Dolatabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two benchmarks, MentalBench-100k and MentalAlign-70k, to evaluate LLMs in mental health support, addressing challenges like dataset scale and judge reliability. It reveals biases and reliability variations in LLM judges compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in mental health lack scale, reliability, and frameworks to assess automated judges. This work aims to fill these gaps.

Method: Introduces MentalBench-100k (100,000 response pairs from real scenarios) and MentalAlign-70k (comparison of LLM judges vs. human experts on 70,000 ratings). Uses Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework with ICC to measure agreement.

Result: LLM judges show systematic inflation, high reliability for cognitive attributes (guidance, informativeness), reduced precision for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance.

Conclusion: The benchmarks and framework provide new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable, large-scale LLM evaluation in mental health.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and

*Suswitha Pericharla,Daniel B. Hier,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for biomedical term normalization, highlighting differences in performance across terminologies due to identifier popularity and lexicalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capabilities of LLMs in linking natural language biomedical terms to standardized identifiers, focusing on memorization and generalization across diverse biomedical ontologies.

Method: The study fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B and compared its performance with GPT-4o across terminologies like GO, HPO, and GENE, analyzing memorization and generalization gains.

Result: Fine-tuning improved accuracy for GO (77% memorization gain) but not HPO. Generalization occurred only for GENE mappings (13.9% gain). GPT-4o outperformed Llama variants consistently.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning success depends on identifier popularity and lexicalization, guiding when it enhances factual recall versus failing for sparse or arbitrary identifiers.

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs handle conflicts between their parametric knowledge and prompt information, focusing on code generation, and introduces a framework for analyzing these conflicts with notable accuracy improvements through activation-level steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM behavior when encountering knowledge conflicts, especially in code generation, and to develop methods for detecting and steering such conflicts effectively.

Method: Proposes a domain-agnostic framework for constructing knowledge conflicts, a novel evaluation method, and uses activation-level steering for improvement.

Result: Achieves 80.65% accuracy in detecting knowledge conflicts and a 12.6% improvement in steering success over random baseline.

Conclusion: Effectiveness depends on balancing model size, task domain, and steering direction, with potential for public release of experiment code and data.

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

### [93] [A Graph Signal Processing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19117)
*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spectral analysis framework for detecting hallucinations in large language models by modeling transformer layers as dynamic graphs, achieving higher accuracy than perplexity-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing factual reasoning from hallucinations in large language models.

Method: Uses spectral analysis to model transformer layers as dynamic graphs with token embeddings as signals, defining diagnostics like Dirichlet energy and spectral entropy.

Result: Experiments reveal universal spectral patterns: factual statements show low-frequency convergence, while hallucinations exhibit distinct signatures. A detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy.

Conclusion: Spectral geometry captures reasoning patterns and error behaviors, offering a potential framework for hallucination detection.

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

### [94] [Training-Free Spectral Fingerprints of Voice Processing in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19131)
*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spectral analysis of transformer architectures reveals distinct computational fingerprints linked to linguistic processing and training emphasis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover how different transformer architectures implement linguistic computations uniquely, detectable through spectral analysis, and how training biases manifest in connectivity patterns.

Method: Graph signal processing was applied to attention-induced token graphs, focusing on algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value) during voice alternation across 20 languages and three model families (Phi-3-Mini, Qwen2.5-7B, LLaMA-3.2-1B). Early layers (2–5) were analyzed.

Result: Phi-3-Mini showed English-specific disruptions, Qwen2.5-7B exhibited shifts for morphologically rich languages, and LLaMA-3.2-1B had muted responses. Spectral signatures correlated with behavioral differences and were modulated by attention head ablations.

Conclusion: Training emphasis imprints detectable computational patterns, offering a framework to diagnose architectural biases and assess model reliability.

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

TL;DR: Survey on Tibetan AI research highlights challenges like data sparsity and lack of benchmarks, reviews existing resources and tools, and suggests future directions for inclusive AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in AI research for Tibetan, a low-resource language, by surveying current resources, tools, and challenges.

Method: Comprehensive review of Tibetan AI research, categorizing datasets and tools, evaluating methods, and comparing performance.

Result: Identified bottlenecks (e.g., data sparsity) and highlighted potential solutions like cross-lingual transfer and community-driven efforts.

Conclusion: Serves as a foundational reference for future Tibetan AI research and advocates collaborative efforts for sustainable AI development.

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

*Dingjie Fu,Dianxing Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can pass standardized hiring evaluations for software engineers, finding that all tested models fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the high demand for skilled engineers and the potential of LLMs in coding tasks.

Method: Researchers analyze responses from state-of-the-art LLMs on a professional assessment questionnaire, comparing them to company-referenced solutions.

Result: The LLMs' answers significantly deviated from expected solutions, failing the evaluation.

Conclusion: Despite their capabilities, LLMs cannot yet pass hiring evaluations for engineering roles.

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

TL;DR: TSSS is a structured multi-hop RAG framework that improves efficiency by caching recurring prefixes and using deterministic termination, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-hop RAG methods are inefficient due to predictable token regeneration and stochastic stopping, leading to high token usage and instability.

Method: TSSS introduces template-based reasoning to cache prefixes and anchor sub-queries, and a retriever-based terminator for deterministic stopping.

Result: On benchmarks like HotpotQA and MuSiQue, TSSS achieves top accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT methods.

Conclusion: TSSS enhances efficiency and reliability in multi-hop RAG, making it suitable for scenarios like on-device inference.

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces evolveQA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on temporal knowledge conflicts using real-world time-stamped corpora, showing significant performance drops compared to static questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for temporal knowledge conflicts in LLMs lack dynamic structure and focus on easily-memorized entities, failing to fairly evaluate LLMs with varying knowledge cut-off dates.

Method: The authors develop evolveQA using 3 real-world time-stamped corpora (AWS updates, Azure changes, WHO reports) to generate questions tailored to LLMs' knowledge cut-off dates, evaluating 12 LLMs across 3 probing formats.

Result: Experiments show LLMs suffer performance drops of up to 31% on evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Conclusion: evolveQA effectively highlights LLMs' limitations in handling evolving knowledge, providing a more nuanced evaluation framework.

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a question answering system that bypasses reliance on large language models (LLMs) and focuses on knowledge graph retrieval.

Method: Divides the pipeline into two stages: pre-processing documents into QA pairs, and converting these into a knowledge graph for retrieval using embeddings and fuzzy techniques.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 71.9% (LLAMA-3.2) and 54.4% (GPT-3.5-Turbo) on the CRAG benchmark.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of knowledge graph-based QA systems without LLMs, though performance varies with backend models.

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods lack the ability to capture critical errors in multi-turn tool-augmented dialogues.

Method: TRACE benchmark synthesizes tool-augmented conversations covering diverse errors; SCOPE framework automates error pattern discovery.

Result: SCOPE outperforms baselines, especially in cases with misleading user satisfaction signals.

Conclusion: TRACE and SCOPE improve evaluation accuracy for tool-augmented conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiSRouter is a distributed self-routing system for LLMs that outperforms centralized routers by leveraging LLMs' self-awareness for flexible, scalable query routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized routers for LLMs are inflexible and perform poorly due to limited understanding of LLMs' knowledge boundaries.

Method: DiSRouter employs distributed routing where LLM agents decide to answer or route queries based on self-awareness, enabled by a two-stage Self-Awareness Training pipeline.

Result: DiSRouter outperforms existing methods in utility, distinguishes query difficulty, and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs' intrinsic self-awareness for routing is more effective than external assessment, enabling modular, efficient multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for improving cross-lingual transfer by addressing limitations in existing linguistic knowledge bases, proposing structure-aware representations and a unified composite distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linguistic knowledge bases like URIEL+ have limitations: their generic vector representations don’t suit diverse linguistic data structures, and they lack a method to aggregate signals into a single score.

Method: Proposes type-matched language distances with structure-aware representations: speaker-weighted distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and latent variables for typology. Combines these into a composite distance.

Result: The new representations and composite distances consistently improve performance in selecting transfer languages across various NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more principled and effective toolkit for multilingual research, addressing gaps in existing approaches.

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex spreadsheet structures and reasoning accuracy, necessitating a specialized framework.

Method: SheetBrain uses three modules: understanding (summary and problem insight), execution (Python sandbox and Excel toolkit), and validation (correctness verification).

Result: SheetBrain outperforms existing benchmarks and a new challenging benchmark (SheetBench) in accuracy.

Conclusion: SheetBrain addresses LLM limitations in tabular reasoning, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy for complex spreadsheet tasks.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: Addresses limitations in current neural question generation methods, which lack direct multiple-choice question generation and optimized difficulty control accuracy.

Method: Leverages a large language model trained with direct preference optimization to enhance difficulty control accuracy.

Result: Introduces a method capable of generating multiple-choice questions with improved difficulty controllability.

Conclusion: This approach advances adaptive learning tools by overcoming key limitations in question generation.

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TheMCPCompany benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents using REST APIs, showing advanced models perform well with tool retrieval but struggle in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well tool-calling agents can interact with real-world services using REST APIs, addressing the limitations of current browser-based agents.

Method: Created MCP servers with over 18,000 tools using REST APIs, provided ground-truth tools, and tested agent performance with perfect and retrieved tools.

Result: Advanced models like GPT-5 perform close to ground-truth tools with retrieval, while smaller models struggle. Complex environments remain challenging.

Conclusion: Navigating and combining thousands of tools for complex tasks is still difficult, requiring improved reasoning and retrieval models.

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

*Fan Xu,Huixuan Zhang,Zhenliang Zhang,Jiahao Wang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces JointCQ, a framework for joint claim-and-query generation to improve hallucination detection in LLMs by addressing limitations in claim extraction and query generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods suffer from context loss and low specificity in early stages, degrading overall performance.

Method: JointCQ combines claim extraction and query generation using filtered training data and a fine-tuned language model.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods on open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: JointCQ advances the development of more trustworthy and transparent LLMs.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

*Kailin Jiang,Hongbo Jiang,Ning Jiang,Zhi Gao,Jinhe Bi,Yuchen Ren,Bin Li,Yuntao Du,Lei Liu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KORE is a method for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge, addressing issues like catastrophic forgetting through structured knowledge conversion and covariance matrix utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models struggle with static knowledge and inability to adapt to real-world changes, necessitating effective knowledge injection methods.

Method: KORE uses knowledge-oriented augmentations and constraints, converting knowledge items into structured formats and utilizing covariance matrices for retention.

Result: Experiments on models like LLaVA-v1.5-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B show KORE's superior performance in knowledge injection and retention.

Conclusion: KORE effectively addresses the dual goals of knowledge adaptation and retention in large multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination in NLG models by introducing a taxonomy and HAD models for detection and correction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about the reliability of NLG models due to hallucination prompted the need for robust detection and correction methods.

Method: Proposed a hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories and developed HAD models integrating detection, identification, and correction.

Result: HAD models outperformed baselines on in-domain and out-of-domain tests, achieving top results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench.

Conclusion: The HAD models demonstrate robustness and versatility, making them effective for improving NLG reliability.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

*Junjie Song,Yiwen Liu,Dapeng Li,Yin Sun,Shukun Fu,Siqi Chen,Yuji Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces hypervolume optimization (HVO) for optimizing multiple objectives in text summarization using reinforcement learning with large language models, achieving balanced and improved performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack focus on optimizing the multi-objective problem of summarization through reinforcement learning enhanced by large language models.

Method: Proposes hypervolume optimization (HVO), a strategy that dynamically adjusts reward scores using the hypervolume method to approximate the pareto front.

Result: HVO outperforms GRPO in overall scores and achieves balanced performance across dimensions; a 7B model with HVO matches GPT-4's summarization quality with shorter outputs.

Conclusion: HVO effectively balances multiple summarization objectives, demonstrating superior and more balanced performance than existing methods.

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

*Kadri Hacioglu,Manjunath K E,Andreas Stolcke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating reasoning into speech large language models (speechLLMs) for slot-filling using a chain-of-thought framework, demonstrating performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance slot-filling accuracy by incorporating reasoning steps into speechLLMs, inspired by advancements in reasoning LLMs.

Method: Use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose slot-filling, create a reasoning dataset, and apply supervised fine-tuning to speechLLMs.

Result: Performance improves with reasoning steps, but reasoning textual LLMs for math/logic domains may not be ideal. Hybrid speechLLMs outperform single-mode models.

Conclusion: Hybrid speechLLMs combining direct and reasoning modes achieve better performance, highlighting the importance of tailored foundation models.

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

TL;DR: The paper explores how personalizing LLMs with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate speech, revealing potential and limitations in reducing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how biases linked to shared or differing identities between annotators and targets impact LLMs' sensitivity to hate speech.

Method: Uses Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models with two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona prompting and deeply contextualized persona development using RAG.

Result: Analyzes the impact of in-group and out-group annotator personas on detection performance and fairness, showing socio-demographic attributes can address bias.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches for equitable hate speech detection, bridging psychology and NLP.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOGICAL, a locally deployable PII removal system using fine-tuned GLiNER, outperforms other methods in efficiency and accuracy for sanitizing clinical notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high computational costs and privacy risks of LLMs in PII removal from EHRs, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Developed LOGICAL, fine-tuned GLiNER model on clinical documents, and compared it against Azure NER, Presidio, Gemini-Pro-2.5, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct.

Result: Fine-tuned GLiNER achieved F1-score of 0.980, sanitized 95% of documents correctly, and operated efficiently on a laptop.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned GLiNER is accurate, efficient, and secure for PII removal, offering a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs.

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper explores how semantic gestures enhance turn-taking predictions in conversations by integrating multimodal cues (text, audio, gestures) using a Mixture-of-Experts framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complementary role of gestures alongside linguistic and acoustic features in managing turn-taking during conversations.

Method: Extended the DnD Gesture corpus with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations and used a Mixture-of-Experts framework to integrate text, audio, and gestures for turn-taking prediction.

Result: Incorporating semantically guided gestures consistently improved performance over baselines, highlighting their complementary role.

Conclusion: Semantic gestures provide valuable cues for turn-taking prediction, enhancing multimodal models.

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

TL;DR: M3-SLU is a new benchmark evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding, focusing on speaker-attributed reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models excel in speech and text comprehension but struggle with identifying speakers in conversations, highlighting a gap in speaker-aware understanding.

Method: M3-SLU uses four open corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, AMI) with 12,000 instances of audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes two tasks: Speaker-Attributed QA and Speaker Attribution via Utterance Matching.

Result: Baseline results show models perform well in capturing content but often fail to identify speakers, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware dialogue understanding.

Conclusion: M3-SLU serves as a challenging benchmark to advance research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: AgenticMath proposes a four-stage agentic pipeline to generate high-quality math Q&A pairs for LLM fine-tuning, achieving competitive performance with fewer samples than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness in current LLM reasoning datasets.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: Seed Question Filter, Agentic Question Rephrase, Answer Augment, and Question & Answer Evaluation.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on AgenticMath datasets (30-60K samples) outperforms baselines trained on larger datasets (400K-2.3M samples).

Conclusion: Targeted, high-quality data generation is more efficient for improving LLM mathematical reasoning than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL introduces KeyChain, a method to enhance long-context reasoning in large language models by transforming short multi-hop QA tasks into complex long-context challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning (RL) methods focus on short-context reasoning, leaving advanced long-context reasoning underexplored. High-difficulty RL data for such tasks is scarce.

Method: LoongRL uses KeyChain to synthesize short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context tasks by inserting UUID chains to obscure the true question among distractions. This requires models to trace steps, retrieve facts, and reason.

Result: LoongRL improves long-context multi-hop QA accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% on Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, respectively. LoongRL-14B achieves a score of 74.2, rivaling larger models.

Conclusion: LoongRL enables effective long-context reasoning without prohibitive costs, generalizes beyond training lengths, and preserves short-context capabilities while excelling in retrieval and stress tests.

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: MoE-Prism introduces a co-design approach to enhance Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models' flexibility by refactoring monolithic experts into sub-experts and enabling QoS-aware scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE models suffer from inflexibility due to coarse-grained operating points, leading to trade-offs between cost and quality. MoE-Prism aims to address this.

Method: MoE-Prism uses an Offline Refactoring Engine to break experts into sub-experts and an Online Scheduling Engine for QoS-aware scheduling.

Result: MoE-Prism provides 4x more operating points, improving throughput by 19.9% under latency constraints or reducing latency by 10.36% under resource limits.

Conclusion: MoE-Prism bridges the model-system gap, enabling adaptive and efficient AI services.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gloss-free SLT approach using sentence embeddings, outperforming existing gloss-free methods and narrowing the gap with gloss-dependent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT systems rely on gloss annotations, which are scarce and inconsistent across datasets.

Method: The proposed method uses sentence embeddings of target sentences as supervision, eliminating the need for manual gloss annotation.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms other gloss-free methods on German and American sign language datasets.

Conclusion: The novel method sets a new state-of-the-art for gloss-free SLT, reducing reliance on scarce gloss annotations.

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Shakib Yazdani,Cennet Oguz,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings for multilingual sign language translation (SLT) and introduces a coupled augmentation method to improve robustness, showing better results than traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLT training is limited by its reliance on single-language text, hindering scalability and cross-language generalization.

Method: The study employs multimodal embeddings trained on text and speech from multiple languages and introduces a coupled augmentation method combining multilingual target augmentations with video-level perturbations.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in BLEURT scores over text-only supervision, particularly in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Language-agnostic embedding supervision with coupled augmentation offers a scalable and semantically robust alternative for SLT training.

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR is a lightweight model probing mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers, achieving high recall and precision across NER benchmarks, with evidence that structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mention detection is foundational for information extraction and a performance bottleneck.

Method: ToMMeR probes mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers and uses an LLM as a judge for precision.

Result: Achieves 93% recall zero-shot, over 90% precision, and near SOTA NER performance (80–87% F1). Cross-model analysis shows convergence on mention boundaries.

Conclusion: Structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently recovered with minimal parameters.

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents DFKI-MLT's end-to-end SLT system for Swiss German Sign Language to German translation, achieving modest BLEU scores but highlighting challenges in test performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve SLT by integrating spatio-temporal features and translation into a single model, addressing limitations of traditional seq2seq architectures.

Method: The proposed system learns spatio-temporal features directly from videos and combines them with translation in an end-to-end architecture.

Result: Results show 5±1 BLEU on development data but a significant drop to 0.11±0.06 BLEU on the test set.

Conclusion: While the model shows potential with its integrated approach, the performance inconsistency on test data indicates a need for further refinement.

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

*Yuan Gao,Suchir Salhan,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery,Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0 introduces a benchmark to evaluate cognitively inspired models using selective tolerance, testing plausibility of learner errors vs. artificial ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between performance benchmarks and cognitively inspired model evaluation.

Method: BLiSS 1.0 uses 136,867 controlled triplets from 2.8M learner sentences to test selective tolerance.

Result: Selective tolerance is distinct from grammaticality, with performance varying by training paradigm.

Conclusion: BLiSS is validated as a tool to measure training objectives' impact on human-like language acquisition.

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

TL;DR: MINED benchmark evaluates LMMs' temporal awareness across 6 dimensions and 11 tasks, revealing gaps in time-sensitive knowledge understanding. Knowledge editing shows promise for updating LMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs struggle with time-sensitive knowledge due to static representations, and existing benchmarks lack dynamic evaluation. MINED aims to fill this gap.

Method: MINED is constructed from Wikipedia, curated by annotators, and evaluates LMMs across 6 dimensions (e.g., cognition, reasoning). Knowledge editing methods are tested for updating LMMs.

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro scores highest (63.07 CEM), while open-source LMMs lag. LMMs excel in organization knowledge but struggle with sports. Knowledge editing proves effective in single scenarios.

Conclusion: MINED highlights LMMs' limitations in temporal awareness and suggests knowledge editing as a viable solution for updating time-sensitive facts.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

### [125] [Re-evaluating Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19471)
*Yuu Jinnai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MBR decoding outperforms beam search in speech-to-text tasks like ASR and ST, showing promise for high-accuracy offline applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if MBR decoding, effective in text-to-text tasks, can improve performance in speech-to-text tasks like ASR and ST.

Method: MBR decoding was tested on English and Japanese ASR and ST tasks using Whisper and its derivatives.

Result: MBR decoding outperformed beam search in most experimental settings.

Conclusion: MBR decoding is promising for offline ASR and ST tasks requiring high accuracy.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VideoAgentTrek automates the extraction of GUI interaction training data from screen-recorded videos, bypassing manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of GUI interaction data is expensive; the paper aims to scale training data acquisition using publicly available videos.

Method: Develops Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module with video grounding and action-content recognition to extract structured interaction steps.

Result: Generates 1.52M interaction steps from 39K videos, improving task success rates by 70% and step accuracy by 5.2%.

Conclusion: Passive internet videos can serve as scalable, high-quality supervision for training computer-use agents.

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

### [127] [Machine Text Detectors are Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19492)
*Ryuto Koike,Liam Dugan,Masahiro Kaneko,Chris Callison-Burch,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the transferability between membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection, showing they share methodological foundations and optimal metrics. It demonstrates strong cross-task performance correlation and introduces MINT for unified evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between two independently researched tasks—MIAs and machine-generated text detection—by investigating their methodological overlaps and transferability.

Method: Theoretical proof of a shared optimal metric for both tasks, followed by large-scale empirical experiments with 7 MIA methods and 5 machine text detectors across diverse domains and generators.

Result: Strong rank correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance, with Binoculars (a machine text detector) achieving state-of-the-art MIA performance.

Conclusion: The findings advocate for cross-task collaboration and introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite, to foster fair comparisons and advancements.

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

*Suchir Salhan,Richard Diehl Martinez,Zébulon Goriely,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of sequence length on BabyLM pretraining, comparing Mamba and OPT models with fixed compute budgets. Findings show optimal length varies by task and architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the best sequence length for training Baby LMs, given that many submissions in the BabyLM Challenge used shorter lengths despite larger contexts being typical in transformer models.

Method: Used 100M-word training data and fixed compute budgets to compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models across different sequence lengths.

Result: Longer sequences generally perform better, but optimal length depends on the task and model architecture. Shorter sequences suffice for grammatical tasks, while longer contexts help morphological reasoning.

Conclusion: Sequence length choice for BabyLM pretraining should be task- and architecture-specific, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

*Canbin Huang,Tianyuan Shi,Yuhua Zhu,Ruijun Chen,Xiaojun Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lookahead is a routing framework for LLM systems that predicts potential outputs to improve model selection, outperforming existing methods by 7.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM routing methods classify queries based only on input, missing valuable output-based insights and contextual nuances.

Method: Lookahead predicts latent representations of potential outputs to guide routing, using causal and masked language models.

Result: Empirical tests on seven benchmarks show Lookahead outperforms baselines by 7.7%.

Conclusion: Lookahead enhances routing efficiency by foreseeing outputs, addressing limitations of input-only classification.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

### [130] [Which Evaluation for Which Model? A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19509)
*Maureen de Seyssel,Eeshan Gunesh Dhekane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified taxonomy to classify evaluations for speech foundation models, aligning models with suitable methods and identifying gaps for future benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech foundation models vary in capabilities and require tailored evaluations; current methods lack cohesion.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy with three axes: evaluation aspect, model capabilities, and task requirements, then classifies existing evaluations accordingly.

Result: Provides a framework for aligning models with evaluations and reveals gaps like prosody and interaction coverage.

Conclusion: The taxonomy serves as a conceptual and practical guide for selecting and improving speech model evaluations.

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

*Danni Liu,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies conditions triggering catastrophic forgetting in multilingual fine-tuning, emphasizing model-data scale balance and instruction-following ability as key factors. Cross-lingual alignment helps mitigate forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify fragmented findings on catastrophic forgetting during multilingual fine-tuning and determine its triggers.

Method: Systematic empirical study using machine translation, varying model architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Relative model-data scale and instruction-following ability are critical; cross-lingual alignment mitigates forgetting and aids transfer.

Conclusion: Balancing model-data scale and leveraging cross-lingual alignment effectively prevent forgetting in multilingual fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PBBQ, a benchmark dataset to evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs, revealing significant biases and their alignment with human cultural stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in resources for detecting social biases in Persian LLMs, given their growing use and alignment concerns.

Method: Developed PBBQ via questionnaires completed by 250 diverse individuals and experts, covering 16 cultural categories with 37,000 questions.

Result: Benchmarked LLMs showed significant social biases in Persian contexts, often mirroring human bias patterns.

Conclusion: PBBQ provides a tool for evaluating and mitigating bias in Persian LLMs, revealing the need for further alignment with social norms.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity assessment, tested on Ukrainian news paired with Polish, Russian, and English, using semantic similarity annotations based on 4W criteria. Evaluates various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses scalability and adaptability gaps in existing manually curated datasets for cross-lingual news analysis.

Method: Developed a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline to collect CrossNews-UA dataset (Ukrainian news paired with Polish, Russian, English), annotated for semantic similarity using 4W criteria. Tested traditional, Transformer-based, and LLM models.

Result: Identified challenges in multilingual news analysis and compared model performances.

Conclusion: Demonstrated a scalable approach for cross-lingual news similarity assessment, providing insights into model effectiveness.

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in NLP models due to stylistic text fonts and emojis, proposing Style Attack Disguise (SAD) to exploit this gap. SAD demonstrates strong attack performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability in NLP models caused by the human-model perception gap when processing stylistic fonts and emojis.

Method: Proposes Style Attack Disguise (SAD) with two variants: light for efficiency and strong for performance. Tests on sentiment classification, machine translation, and multimodal tasks.

Result: SAD shows strong attack performance across NLP models, LLMs, and commercial services, including threats to multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: Stylistic text introduces hidden vulnerabilities in NLP models, and SAD effectively exploits this gap, highlighting the need for robust defenses.

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this

Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LlavaCode compresses code context into compact representations for faster inference in code completion tasks, reducing TTFT by 20-38%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) slows down inference due to extended sequence lengths, impacting interactive settings like IDEs.

Method: Introduces LlavaCode, using a projector module to compress code into single-token vectors interpretable by code LLMs.

Result: Achieves significant EM and ES metric improvements with negligible latency, reducing TTFT by 20-38%.

Conclusion: LlavaCode enhances code completion efficiency by compressing context, making it viable for interactive applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

*Alejandro Pajón-Sanmartín,Francisco De Arriba-Pérez,Silvia García-Méndez,Fátima Leal,Benedita Malheiro,Juan Carlos Burguillo-Rial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in emotion recognition using LLMs and compares fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering across three scenarios, achieving over 70% accuracy with fine-tuned models and emphasizing structured prompts and emotion grouping for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like contextual ambiguity and linguistic variability hinder direct application of generalist models in emotion recognition, prompting a comparison of fine-tuning and prompt engineering methods.

Method: The study evaluates fine-tuned pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts, different emotion prompt designs, and emotion grouping techniques across three scenarios.

Result: Fine-tuned models achieved over 70% accuracy in emotion recognition, with structured prompt engineering and emotion grouping significantly enhancing LLM performance.

Conclusion: Structured prompts and emotion grouping improve LLM effectiveness in emotion detection, benefiting sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and user behavior understanding.

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

*Xiang Liu,Xuming Hu,Xiaowen Chu,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores inefficiencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) during reasoning tasks, identifying a U-shaped entropy pattern related to problem difficulty. It introduces DiffAdapt, a lightweight framework that optimizes inference strategies based on difficulty, reducing token usage by up to 22.4% without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of LLMs in generating unnecessarily long reasoning traces, especially for easy problems, and to improve their computational efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: Analyzes token probability entropy in reasoning traces, identifies a U-shaped pattern, and proposes DiffAdapt—a framework that selects tailored inference strategies (Easy/Normal/Hard) based on problem difficulty and entropy. DiffAdapt uses a small probe for classification without fine-tuning the base LLM.

Result: DiffAdapt achieves comparable or improved accuracy across five models and eight benchmarks while reducing token usage by up to 22.4%, demonstrating computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies and mitigates overthinking in LLMs, presenting DiffAdapt as a practical, lightweight solution for efficient reasoning without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

*Hasan Akgul,Mari Eplik,Javier Rojas,Aina Binti Abdullah,Pieter van der Merwe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSense-LLM is an edge-first framework integrating multimodal sensors with LLMs, ensuring efficiency, privacy, and low latency through lightweight encoders, local retrieval, cost-aware policies, and secure execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of integrating continuous sensor streams with large language models while adhering to strict latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints in real-world environments like homes, offices, and clinics.

Method: CoSense-LLM comprises four components: SenseFusion (lightweight encoder), Edge-RAG (local retrieval layer), PromptRouter (cost-aware policy), and Secure Execution (privacy enforcement). It leverages modern optimizations like KV caches and quantized LoRA adapters.

Result: The system achieves sub-second latency, reduces bandwidth costs, and maintains privacy by transmitting only discrete codes. Edge-RAG improves factual consistency, and calibrated uncertainty aids in controlled escalations.

Conclusion: CoSense-LLM demonstrates the viability of edge-first designs for LLM deployments, balancing semantics, privacy, and low latency in dynamic environments.

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

*Addison J. Wu,Ryan Liu,Kerem Oktar,Theodore R. Sumers,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether LLMs can critically evaluate content by considering the motivations of the source, finding they perform well in controlled settings but struggle with real-world scenarios like online ads. A simple intervention improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can mimic humans' ability to evaluate content based on the motivations of the source, which is crucial for their real-world effectiveness.

Method: Combines controlled cognitive science experiments with real-world evaluations (sponsored online adverts) and tests a steering intervention to boost vigilance.

Result: LLMs show human-like discounting of biased information in controlled settings but struggle in real-world scenarios. A simple intervention significantly improves their performance.

Conclusion: LLMs have basic sensitivity to motivational cues but need further improvements to generalize effectively to real-world contexts.

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompting affects LM representations inconsistently with prompt-task relevance, challenging assumptions about their correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-trained embeddings support zero-shot task-solving through prompting.

Method: Conducted probing experiments on prompt embeddings, analyzing various prompt templates for zero-shot classification.

Result: Prompting impacts representation quality, but changes don't consistently correlate with prompt-task relevance.

Conclusion: Relevant prompts don't always yield better representations, suggesting other factors influence performance.

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of making complex legal texts accessible to laypersons by providing structured, proactive dialogue systems.

Method: Constructed EUDial from 204 blogs, containing 880 dialogue turns, and proposed LexGuide, a retrieval-augmented framework with hierarchical topic organization.

Result: Structured navigation improves legal information comprehension, making EUDial and LexGuide practical tools for proactive legal dialogue systems.

Conclusion: EUDial and LexGuide effectively bridge the gap between legal information availability and citizen understanding.

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Zhyper is a parameter-efficient hypernetwork framework generating LoRA adapters from text, outperforming baselines with fewer parameters and better cultural alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of prompt engineering and fine-tuning methods in conditioning LLMs to specific norms or values, which often require excessive parameters.

Method: Proposes Zhyper, a factorized hypernetwork framework that creates context-aware LoRA adapters using textual descriptions.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with up to 26x fewer parameters than baselines and shows improved generalization in cultural alignment.

Conclusion: Zhyper offers an efficient solution for conditioning LLMs, reducing parameter overhead while enhancing contextual and cultural alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

*Xichen Zhang,Sitong Wu,Haoru Tan,Shaozuo Yu,Yinghao Zhu,Ziyi He,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SmartSwitch, a plug-and-play framework to address 'underthinking' in large language models by guiding deeper exploration of promising thoughts during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat 'underthinking'—shallow reasoning causing frequent thought switches—in large language models, ensuring better performance and token efficiency.

Method: SmartSwitch monitors reasoning, detects premature thought switches using a process reward model (PRM), and intervenes by backtracking and prompting deeper exploration.

Result: SmartSwitch significantly improves the performance of various large language models on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The SmartSwitch framework effectively mitigates underthinking, enhancing reasoning depth and model performance.

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSPEC improves speculative decoding by filtering difficult tokens during knowledge distillation, boosting acceptance rates without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance alignment between draft and target models in speculative decoding, addressing the KL divergence misalignment issue in conventional KD methods.

Method: AdaSPEC introduces selective token filtering using a reference model to focus distillation on simpler tokens.

Result: Outperforms DistillSpec with higher token acceptance rates (up to 15%) across tasks like arithmetic reasoning and coding.

Conclusion: AdaSPEC effectively improves speculative decoding performance by refining the distillation process.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model merging outperforms conventional adaptation strategies like full fine-tuning and CPT->FT for code-mixed NLP tasks, showing better utilization of unlabeled data and stronger cross-pair transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a practical alternative to traditional adaptation strategies for code-mixed NLP, leveraging multilingual base models and unlabeled data more effectively.

Method: Combine continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text, merge the adapted checkpoint with the base model, and fine-tune on downstream tasks.

Result: Merged models achieve 2--5 F1 point gains over full fine-tuning and 1--2 points over CPT->FT, with stronger cross-pair transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: Model merging is a robust adaptation strategy for code-mixed NLP, especially in low-resource scenarios, though scaling considerations remain.

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolDreamer improves tool retrieval for LLMs by using synthetic tool descriptions generated by LLMs, aligning queries better with tool descriptions and enhancing retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval models struggle because user queries often don’t match tool descriptions (TD), leading to suboptimal performance. ToolDreamer aims to bridge this gap.

Method: ToolDreamer generates hypothetical (synthetic) TD using an LLM, conditioning retrievers to fetch tools based on these descriptions for better alignment.

Result: Applied to ToolRet dataset, ToolDreamer improves sparse and dense retrievers' performance, with or without training.

Conclusion: ToolDreamer offloads reasoning burden to retrievers, enabling LLMs to handle large tool sets without exceeding context limits.

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight framework for optimizing multilingual prompt-space in LLMs, improving performance by enhancing naturalness, cultural adaptation, and difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translation-based prompts for multilingual synthetic data inherit English-centric biases and overlook cultural dimensions, limiting model generalization.

Method: A framework transforms translated prompts systematically for naturalness, cultural adaptation, and difficulty enhancement, tested on 12 languages.

Result: Substantial improvements over translation-only baselines: +4.7% Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% Flores XCometXL, and +35.3% wins on mArenaHard.

Conclusion: Prompt-space optimization is a simple, powerful paradigm for creating more robust, culturally grounded multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

TL;DR: Scaf-GRPO introduces a scaffolded training framework to help LLMs overcome learning plateaus in reinforcement learning by providing tiered hints, improving performance on challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the 'learning cliff' phenomenon in reinforcement learning for LLMs, where models fail to progress when tasks exceed their current capabilities due to zero-reward signals.

Method: Scaf-GRPO diagnoses learning stagnation and intervenes with tiered hints (from abstract to concrete) to guide the model toward valid solutions.

Result: Scaf-GRPO boosts the pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model by 44.3% on the AIME24 benchmark compared to vanilla GRPO.

Conclusion: Scaf-GRPO provides an effective method for enhancing LLMs' ability to solve previously unattainable problems, advancing autonomous reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

Motivation: To scientifically study memorization risks in large language models by controlling and analyzing the insertion of sensitive data.

Method: Developed standard and perturbed LLMs (1B/8B parameters) pretrained on 100B/500B tokens. Perturbed models inserted controlled text (e.g., books, biographies) to emulate memorization risks.

Result: Memorization risks depend on sensitive data frequency relative to corpus size. Continued exposure affects memorization, and early exposure dilutes risks.

Conclusion: Hubble provides tools for memorization research, suggesting dilution and early data ordering as mitigation strategies, and invites community exploration.

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)

and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

### [151] [Local Guidance for Configuration-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19072)
*Tomoki Arita,Keisuke Okumura*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Local guidance improves multi-agent pathfinding by focusing on spatiotemporal cues near each agent, enhancing solution quality without excessive computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative to global guidance by providing localized information to agents, aiming to improve coordination efficiency without high computational demands.

Method: The study applies local guidance in the vicinity of each agent, using recomputation as agents move, and tests it with LaCAM, a configuration-based solver.

Result: Local guidance significantly improves solution quality without exceeding moderate time budgets, setting a new performance standard for MAPF.

Conclusion: Local guidance is a viable and effective approach for enhancing MAPF performance, offering an alternative to global methods.

Abstract: Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of
real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers
additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global
scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire
workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby
improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an
alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent.
While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may
appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying
informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve
solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to
LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes
a new performance frontier for MAPF.

*Usama Antuley,Shahbaz Siddiqui,Sufian Hameed,Waqas Arif,Subhan Shah,Syed Attique Shah*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: SORA-ATMAS is a governance framework for agentic AI in smart cities, improving decision-making and compliance across heterogeneous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address governance, risk, and compliance challenges in deploying AI across smart city ecosystems.

Method: Evaluation using three domain agents (Weather, Traffic, Safety) with governance policies and fallback mechanisms.

Result: Achieved 35% MAE reduction, stable weather monitoring, effective traffic handling, and scalable performance.

Conclusion: SORA-ATMAS is a resilient, regulation-aligned framework for accountable smart-city management.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of smart cities has increased the reliance on intelligent
interconnected services to optimize infrastructure, resources, and citizen
well-being. Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous
decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in
real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as
transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and
safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards.
However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises
critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including
accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized
infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather,
Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a
fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs
(GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs,
producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable
weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and
adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a
3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2
requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under
100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales.
Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting
permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate
SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance
framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable,
real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in hardware, software, and LLMs enable evolving human-OS interactions beyond command-line interfaces, aiming for agents that faithfully follow user desires.

Method: ColorAgent uses step-wise reinforcement learning, self-evolving training, and a tailored multi-agent framework for robust interactions. It also focuses on personalized intent recognition and proactive engagement.

Result: Achieves success rates of 77.2% and 50.7% on AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, respectively, setting a new state of the art.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks are insufficient for comprehensive OS agent evaluation; future work should explore evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security.

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model
technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved
from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions.
Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions
and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical
report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon,
robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and
proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the
environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise
reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a
tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and
robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent
recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an
automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on
the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2%
and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we
note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of
OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly
in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our

*Trung-Dung Vu,Benoit Gaudou,Kamaldeep Singh Oberoi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes an architecture combining LLMs and agent-based simulation to model human mobility behavior in multimodal transport systems, validated in Toulouse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model realistic human mobility choices for personalized transport solutions.

Method: Integrates GAMA simulation platform with LLM-based generative agents, GTFS data, and OpenTripPlanner.

Result: Agents make context-aware transport decisions and develop habits over time.

Conclusion: LLMs with agent-based simulation advance intelligent transport systems, though scaling and real-time data integration remain future challenges.

Abstract: Modeling realistic human behaviour to understand people's mode choices in
order to propose personalised mobility solutions remains challenging. This
paper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior
in complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in
Toulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based
simulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework
integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent,
along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport,
and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the
interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent
interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment
from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative
agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes.
Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware
transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining
LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing
intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility
solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future
work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining
memory models.

*Takahiro Suzuki,Keisuke Okumura*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: PULL is a polynomial-time algorithm for Connected Unlabeled Multi-Agent Pathfinding (CUMAPF), ensuring connectivity while advancing agents towards targets. It performs well experimentally and integrates into an optimal solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUMAPF addresses limitations of standard MAPF in swarm robotics, where maintaining agent connectivity is crucial.

Method: PULL uses a rule-based one-step function to compute configurations preserving connectivity and progressing towards targets.

Result: PULL runs efficiently ($O(n^2)$ per step) and achieves competitive solutions for hundreds of agents.

Conclusion: PULL is effective for CUMAPF, with practical performance and integration potential for optimal solutions.

Abstract: We consider Connected Unlabeled Multi-Agent Pathfinding (CUMAPF), a variant
of MAPF where the agents must maintain connectivity at all times. This problem
is fundamental to swarm robotics applications like self-reconfiguration and
marching, where standard MAPF is insufficient as it does not guarantee the
required connectivity between agents. While unlabeled MAPF is tractable in
optimization, CUMAPF is NP-hard even on highly restricted graph classes. To
tackle this challenge, we propose PULL, a complete and polynomial-time
algorithm with a simple design. It is based on a rule-based one-step function
that computes a subsequent configuration that preserves connectivity and
advances towards the target configuration. PULL is lightweight, and runs in
$O(n^2)$ time per step in 2D grid, where $n$ is the number of agents. Our
experiments further demonstrate its practical performance: PULL finds
competitive solution qualities against trivial solutions for hundreds of
agents, in randomly generated instances. Furthermore, we develop an eventually
optimal solver that integrates PULL into an existing search-based MAPF
algorithm, providing a valuable tool for small-scale instances.

### [156] [3D Optimization for AI Inference Scaling: Balancing Accuracy, Cost, and Latency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18905)
*Minseok Jung,Abhas Ricky,Muhammad Rameez Chatni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D optimization framework for AI inference scaling, addressing accuracy, cost, and latency constraints simultaneously, outperforming traditional 1D and 2D approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for AI inference scaling rely on simplistic 1D or 2D approaches, which overlook the interplay of accuracy, cost, and latency constraints, necessitating a more holistic framework.

Method: A 3D optimization framework is developed, using Monte Carlo simulations across three scenarios and nine simulated large language models, evaluating four optimization methods for multi-objective optimization.

Result: The framework identifies knee-point optimization as the best balance, while accuracy-maximization excels when precision is critical, outperforming traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling, adaptable to diverse operational contexts.

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

*Ziquan Wei,Tingting Dan,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable foundation model for functional neuroimages using multitask learning and semi-supervised finetuning to improve clinical applications, achieving promising results in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for functional neuroimages face limitations due to small sample sizes and misalignment of self-supervision with brain-to-outcome relationships, hindering clinical applications.

Method: The approach involves multitask pretraining by tokenizing brain-environment interactions (BEI) and semi-supervised finetuning using pseudo-labels from pretrained BEI.

Result: The model demonstrated promising performance in sex prediction, behavior recognition, and early diagnosis of diseases like Autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Schizophrenia.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model shows significant potential to enhance neuroimaging applications in clinical settings.

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO generalizes DPO with soft preferences, reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions, improving performance in noisy settings and offering practical variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of standard DPO by introducing flexibility in preference modeling and stability in training.

Method: ADPO integrates soft preference probabilities, arbitrary reference-policy anchors, and Plackett-Luce distributions for listwise modeling.

Result: ADPO outperforms DPO in contextual bandits and sequential RL, showing significant gains in noisy and extreme conditions.

Conclusion: ADPO's variants are recommended for different noise levels, proving its versatility and effectiveness.

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the MLX framework's performance for transformer model inference on Apple silicon devices, comparing it to PyTorch on NVIDIA GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for efficient on-device ML frameworks due to the widespread use of LLMs and ML models on smaller devices.

Method: Developed MLX-transformers to compare transformer model latency in MLX vs. PyTorch, using models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa on Apple silicon and NVIDIA GPUs.

Result: MLX shows potential for efficient on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Conclusion: MLX facilitates seamless execution of transformer models on Apple silicon, making on-device ML more accessible.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

TL;DR: GRPO and Dr.GRPO are introduced as noise-robust frameworks for RLHF/RLVR, addressing reward corruption with provable bias correction, improving accuracy in math and code tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle noise sensitivity in RLHF/RLVR, which is critical for aligning LLMs or reasoning models, by explicitly modeling reward corruption and correcting it.

Method: Introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Dr.GRPO, modeling reward corruption as Bernoulli noise and applying noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities.

Result: Empirical improvements include up to 6.7% accuracy gain in math tasks and 1.5% in code tasks under noisy reward conditions.

Conclusion: Bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning to RLHF, providing theoretical robustness and practical benefits for noisy real-world deployments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

TL;DR: Three novel multiscale learning approaches are proposed to address challenges in modeling complex systems: Partition of Unity with neural networks, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Sparse High-Order SVD for limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning methods struggle with nonlinearities, sensitivity to initial conditions, and capturing high-frequency behaviors in multiscale systems.

Method: 1. Partition of Unity (PU) with neural networks decomposes dynamics. 2. SVD extracts dominant modes. 3. Sparse High-Order SVD handles limited data.

Result: These methods accurately capture macro- and micro-scale dynamics, even with incomplete observations.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for complex multiscale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BAPO, a method to address challenges in off-policy RL for LLMs by dynamically adjusting clipping bounds, improving stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL in off-policy settings with LLMs faces issues like policy entropy decline and instability.

Method: Proposes BAPO, which adaptively adjusts clipping bounds to balance policy gradients and preserve entropy.

Result: BAPO achieves stable and efficient training, outperforming benchmarks like SkyWork-OR1-7B and proprietary models.

Conclusion: BAPO is effective for off-policy RL in LLMs, offering improved stability and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [163] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that many post-mortem generalization measures for DNNs are fragile, meaning small training changes can significantly alter their values, trends, or scaling behaviors, and calls for auditing new measures for fragility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the fragility of post-mortem generalization measures in DNNs and advocate for their careful evaluation to ensure robustness.

Method: The authors examine various generalization measures (e.g., path norm, PAC-Bayes) under minor training modifications (hyperparameter changes, SGD variants) and analyze their consistency and sensitivity.

Result: Many measures show fragility, with minor changes reversing trends or failing to capture data complexity. PAC-Bayes, while robust to hyperparameter tweaks, misses data-complexity differences.

Conclusion: Developers should audit generalization measures for fragility to ensure reliable qualitative trends and scaling behavior.

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda is a new PEFT method balancing memory efficiency and fine-grained adaptation by identifying important parameters and using bypass connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between memory efficiency and precise adaptation in existing PEFT methods.

Method: Identify important parameters, introduce bypass connections for them, and only update these connections during finetuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with ≤0.02% trainable parameters and reduces CUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

Conclusion: NeuroAda effectively reconciles the trade-off, offering high memory efficiency and fine-grained adaptation.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators like FNOs and DeepONets are efficient but struggle with OOD generalization, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: Adversarial teacher-student distillation with PGD-style active sampling and differentiable solver supervision enhances training inputs.

Result: Experiments show improved OOD robustness for Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems without sacrificing efficiency.

Conclusion: The adversarial distillation framework successfully balances robustness and efficiency in neural operators.

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

### [166] [An Encode-then-Decompose Approach to Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection on Contaminated Training Data--Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18998)
*Buang Zhang,Tung Kieu,Xiangfei Qiu,Chenjuan Guo,Jilin Hu,Aoying Zhou,Christian S. Jensen,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm for unsupervised time series anomaly detection, improving robustness against training anomalies and proposing a mutual information metric for anomaly scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoencoder-based methods for unsupervised time series anomaly detection suffer from reduced accuracy due to sensitivity to anomalies in training data. The authors aim to enhance robustness and performance.

Method: The proposed method involves decomposing the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations and replacing reconstruction errors with a mutual information metric for anomaly detection.

Result: The approach achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks and shows robustness across varying contamination ratios in training data.

Conclusion: The encode-then-decompose paradigm and mutual information metric significantly improve anomaly detection accuracy and robustness in contaminated time series.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

*Saman Nessari,Ali Bozorgi-Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A system combining LLMs, CTGANs, T-learner models, and contextual bandits enhances personalized medicine by processing medical data and optimizing treatment selection, showing superior performance in colon cancer cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized treatments often ignore individual patient variations, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This work aims to address this gap through personalized, data-driven clinical recommendations.

Method: The system integrates LLMs for data processing, CTGANs for synthetic data generation, T-learners for treatment response prediction, and contextual bandits for dynamic therapy selection.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in data processing (93.2%), synthetic data generation (55%), and treatment response prediction (84.3%). Outperformed reference methods in colon cancer trials with a reward score of 0.60-0.61.

Conclusion: The system advances personalized medicine by overcoming cold-start issues and improving computational efficiency, tailoring treatments to individual patient needs.

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

*Laurent Bonnasse-Gahot,Jean-Pierre Nadal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Category learning enhances stimulus discrimination near boundaries, extending neuroscience models to artificial networks. Minimizing Bayes cost maximizes mutual information, requiring optimal neural space metrics and projections. Neural Fisher information aligns with category-specific sensitivities, expanding near boundaries and matching empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge neuroscience and artificial networks by explaining how categorical perception emerges through efficient learning, focusing on mutual information and Fisher information metrics.

Method: Theoretical framework extends to artificial networks, minimizing Bayes cost (cross-entropy loss) to maximize mutual information. Analyzes neural Fisher information alignment with category-specific sensitivities using toy models and MNIST.

Result: Optimal learning aligns neural Fisher information with category-specific sensitivities, expanding neural space near boundaries. Eigenvectors identify discriminant directions, with maxima near but not at boundaries.

Conclusion: Category learning induces neural space expansion near decision boundaries, validated numerically. Connects to Information Bottleneck and introduces a bias-variance decomposition of Bayes cost.

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

### [169] [Empowering Decision Trees via Shape Function Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19040)
*Nakul Upadhya,Eldan Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Shape Generalized Trees (SGTs), a novel decision tree variant that uses learnable axis-aligned shape functions for richer, non-linear splits while maintaining interpretability. The proposed ShapeCART algorithm efficiently learns SGTs, and extensions like S$^2$GT and SGT$_K$ further enhance flexibility. Experiments show SGTs outperform traditional trees with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees rely on simple axis-aligned splits, leading to deep, complex structures that hinder interpretability. The authors aim to address this by introducing richer, non-linear splits while preserving human comprehension.

Method: The paper proposes Shape Generalized Trees (SGTs) with learnable axis-aligned shape functions for non-linear partitioning. ShapeCART is introduced as an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs, with extensions like Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$ for bivariate and multi-way variants (S$^2$GT and SGT$_K$).

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

Conclusion: SGTs offer a promising alternative to traditional decision trees by combining interpretability with enhanced performance through non-linear splits, supported by efficient learning algorithms.

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

### [170] [POLAR: Policy-based Layerwise Reinforcement Learning Method for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19056)
*Kuai Yu,Xiaoyu Wu,Peishen Yan,Qingqian Yang,Linshan Jiang,Hao Wang,Yang Hua,Tao Song,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POLAR uses RL to optimize backdoor-critical layer selection in FL, enhancing attack success while maintaining stealthiness, outperforming existing methods by up to 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BC layer approaches lack consideration of interlayer relations, making them ineffective and detectable. POLAR aims to dynamically optimize layer selection for better stealth and effectiveness.

Method: POLAR employs lightweight RL with Bernoulli sampling to learn attack strategies, using policy gradient updates based on BSR improvements. Regularization limits modified layers for stealth.

Result: POLAR achieves up to 40% higher success rates against six SOTA defenses compared to existing attack methods.

Conclusion: POLAR demonstrates superior effectiveness and stealthiness in FL backdoor attacks, leveraging RL for dynamic layer selection.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

### [171] [Weight Decay may matter more than muP for Learning Rate Transfer in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19093)
*Atli Kosson,Jeremy Welborn,Yang Liu,Martin Jaggi,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumptions of Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) for learning rate transfer, showing it primarily acts as implicit warmup and weight decay stabilizes dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient large-scale neural network training without costly hyperparameter tuning by transferring learning rates.

Method: Large-scale empirical investigation of muP's assumptions, focusing on practical setups like LLM training.

Result: muP's assumptions hold briefly; weight decay stabilizes dynamics, making muP's scaling act like warmup.

Conclusion: Findings challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer, explaining practices like independent weight decay use.

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

### [172] [What Makes a Good Curriculum? Disentangling the Effects of Data Ordering on LLM Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19099)
*Yaning Jia,Chunhui Zhang,Xingjian Diao,Xiangchi Yuan,Zhongyu Ouyang,soroush vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curriculum learning's effectiveness depends on model capability and task complexity, with no single strategy universally dominating. Task-aligned and inner-state curricula influence different aspects of learning, and prioritizing uncertain samples may improve outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to clarify when and how curriculum learning (CL) benefits LLMs, addressing ambiguities in difficulty metrics and training setups.

Method: The study uses a unified offline evaluation framework with five difficulty dimensions and tests CL strategies on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with models like Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B.

Result: Findings show no universal CL strategy; effectiveness depends on model-task pairs. Task-aligned curricula affect final representations, while inner-state curricula modulate internal states like confidence.

Conclusion: The study disproves a universal CL approach, emphasizing context-dependent strategies and suggesting potential gains from focusing on uncertain samples.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster compresses KANs by clustering coefficient vectors into shared centroids, reducing storage by up to 80x without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs increase expressivity but suffer from high parameter storage; MetaCluster aims to compress them efficiently.

Method: A meta-learner maps embeddings to coefficient vectors, enabling K-means clustering and centroid replacement. Fine-tuning recovers accuracy.

Result: Achieves up to 80x storage reduction on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: MetaCluster effectively compresses KANs while maintaining performance, leveraging clustering and meta-learning.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

*Ahmed Sayeed Faruk,Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores learning peer influence probabilities in networked environments using a contextual linear bandit framework, addressing trade-offs between regret minimization and estimation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding peer influence probabilities is crucial for improving viral marketing and information diffusion, but existing methods either lack accuracy or waste resources.

Method: The study employs a contextual linear bandit framework, proposing an uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm to balance regret minimization and estimation error.

Result: Experiments on semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's superiority over static approaches and standard contextual bandits.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively navigates the trade-off between exploration and estimation, offering practical advantages for peer influence analysis.

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

*Daniel Zhao,Daniel Beaglehole,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Julian McAuley,Zachary Novack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MusicRFM uses Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) to control pre-trained music models by steering internal activations, achieving fine-grained control without retraining or quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable music generation either require model retraining or introduce artifacts. MusicRFM aims to enable precise control over frozen models without these drawbacks.

Method: Lightweight RFM probes discover interpretable concept directions in MusicGen's hidden states. These directions are injected during inference for real-time guidance, with dynamic schedules and multi-property enforcement.

Result: MusicRFM improves note generation accuracy from 0.23 to 0.82 while maintaining prompt fidelity (within ~0.02 of baseline).

Conclusion: MusicRFM effectively balances control and generation quality, offering interpretable and dynamic manipulation of musical attributes without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

### [176] [InvarGC: Invariant Granger Causality for Heterogeneous Interventional Time Series under Latent Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19138)
*Ziyi Zhang,Shaogang Ren,Xiaoning Qian,Nick Duffield*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC) to address limitations in traditional Granger causality tests by leveraging cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate latent confounding and identify intervened environments, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Granger causality tests often fail to detect non-linear causal relationships and rely on strong assumptions like causal sufficiency and known interventional targets. Real-world data often violate these assumptions.

Method: The authors introduce InvarGC, which uses cross-environment heterogeneity to handle latent confounders and distinguish intervened environments at an edge-level granularity.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that InvarGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: InvarGC effectively addresses key challenges in Granger causality analysis, providing robust and invariant causal structure discovery.

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Reya Vir,Sarvesh Bhatnagar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores subliminal corruption in AI systems, where undesirable traits spread through synthetic data without detection, revealing critical thresholds and mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively understand how subliminal corruption spreads in AI systems via synthetic data, bypassing safety checks, and to highlight its risks.

Method: A teacher-student setup with GPT-2 was used to study scaling laws, thresholds, and mechanisms of subliminal corruption.

Result: Key findings include behavioral crossover, a sharp phase transition in alignment failure, and corruption mimicking natural fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Subliminal corruption poses a critical vulnerability in AI systems relying on synthetic data, necessitating new safety protocols.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

*Peng Wang,Minghao Gu,Qiang Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning by proposing feature space adaptation methods (LoRFA and VeFA) to preserve pre-trained knowledge and enhance robustness, outperforming LoRA in robustness tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving model generalization under distribution shifts, especially when downstream data is limited or differs from pre-training distribution.

Method: Proposes LoRFA and VeFA, which fine-tune pre-trained models in feature space using low-rank or vector-based transformations to compensate for lurking variables.

Result: Achieves comparable fine-tuning performance to LoRA and consistently stronger robustness across image classification, NLU, and NLG tasks.

Conclusion: Feature space adaptation preserves pre-trained representations and enhances robustness, offering a promising alternative to weight space fine-tuning.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

*Federico Di Gennaro,Khaled Eldowa,Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores linear partial monitoring, extending classic partial monitoring to infinite outcome spaces with linear structures, and introduces efficient regret bounds for adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to generalize linear bandits by decoupling loss and feedback, addressing nonstochastic scenarios with finite actions.

Method: The authors use exploration-by-optimization to derive efficient regret bounds, focusing on instance-specific metrics.

Result: Regret bounds vary based on game structure, achieving √T in easy games and T^2/3 in hard games, matching stochastic guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework provides tight bounds for various partial information settings, with clear dependence on game structure.

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Motivation: To improve scientific exploration by integrating diverse data for classifying mouse behaviors across environments and time points.

Method: Utilizes Qwen2.5-VL model enhanced with prompts, in-context learning (ICL), and frame-level preprocessing for behavior classification.

Result: Achieves strong F1 scores across behaviors, including rare ones like freezing and fleeing, without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The VLM supports interdisciplinary research by creating comprehensive behavioral datasets for complex questions.

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

### [181] [Natural Gradient VI: Guarantees for Non-Conjugate Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19163)
*Fangyuan Sun,Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper advances the theoretical understanding of Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) for non-conjugate likelihoods by identifying conditions for relative smoothness, proposing a modified algorithm with convergence guarantees, and uncovering hidden convexity properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limited theoretical understanding of NGVI, particularly for non-conjugate likelihoods, where the variational loss is non-convex and harder to analyze.

Method: The authors focus on mean-field parameterization, derive conditions for relative smoothness, propose a modified NGVI algorithm with non-Euclidean projections, and analyze hidden convexity properties under additional assumptions.

Result: They prove global non-asymptotic convergence of their modified algorithm to a stationary point and establish fast global convergence to a global optimum under certain structural assumptions.

Conclusion: The results provide new insights into the geometry and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings, enhancing its theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights gradient imbalance in multi-task RL post-training of LLMs, showing large-gradient tasks don't necessarily yield better learning gains, urging principled gradient correction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the assumption bias in multi-task LLM post-training where gradient imbalances favor large-gradient tasks unjustifiably.

Method: Analyzes gradient contributions and learning gains across tasks in RL post-training, comparing gradients with performance improvements.

Result: Finds no correlation between gradient size and learning gains, with imbalances unexplained by typical training metrics.

Conclusion: Advocates against naive dataset mixing and suggests developing gradient-level correction techniques for balanced LLM optimization.

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

*Xiaoxing Ren,Nicola Bastianello,Thomas Parisini,Andreas A. Malikopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a decentralized actor-critic framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, reducing communication needs while ensuring coordination, with proven convergence and complexity bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems with limited communication, ensuring efficient coordination and reduced communication overhead.

Method: Developed a decentralized actor-critic learning framework where agents perform local policy and value function updates using neural networks before exchanging information.

Result: Achieved finite-time convergence with sample complexity of order O(ε⁻³) and communication complexity of order O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹), validated via numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances communication reduction and coordination, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

*Mengying Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADGNN, a novel GNN architecture that uses active diffusion to overcome over-smoothing by integrating external information sources, enabling efficient global graph understanding while preserving node uniqueness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based GNNs suffer from over-smoothing due to passive heat diffusion, limiting their ability to capture global graph information. The analogy to the 'heat death of the universe' highlights the need for active diffusion to maintain node distinctiveness.

Method: The authors propose ADGNN, which employs active diffusion by dynamically integrating multiple external information sources. It also calculates a closed-form solution for infinite diffusion, preserving node characteristics while capturing global structure.

Result: ADGNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in accuracy and efficiency across various graph tasks, demonstrating its capability to avoid over-smoothing and maintain node uniqueness.

Conclusion: ADGNN effectively addresses the limitations of passive diffusion-based GNNs by introducing active diffusion, enabling better global graph understanding and improved performance.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Collaborative learning among shallow GNNs improves performance without needing a pre-trained teacher, using adaptive logit weighting and entropy enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance lightweight GNN performance without relying on complex pre-trained models, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes a collaborative framework where student GNNs teach each other, using adaptive logit weighting and entropy enhancement for dynamic learning.

Result: Effective performance demonstrated on node and graph classification tasks across three datasets.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning among GNNs is viable and beneficial, especially for multi-task inference.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [186] [Controllable Machine Unlearning via Gradient Pivoting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19226)
*Youngsik Hwang,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reframes machine unlearning as a multi-objective optimization problem, introducing the CUP algorithm with a pivoting mechanism to navigate the Pareto frontier controlled by an 'unlearning intensity' hyperparameter, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off challenges in machine unlearning (MU) between efficacy and model fidelity, including over-forgetting, lack of control, and missing holistic evaluation metrics.

Method: Propose Controllable Unlearning by Pivoting Gradient (CUP), a multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm with a pivoting mechanism to navigate the Pareto frontier using an 'unlearning intensity' hyperparameter.

Result: CUP generates superior Pareto-optimal solutions, outperforming existing methods across vision tasks, validated using the hypervolume indicator.

Conclusion: Reframing MU as MOO and using CUP provides precise control and better trade-offs, addressing key challenges in machine unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Motivation: To replicate infants' unsupervised learning abilities like categorization and novelty detection in machine learning.

Result: Competitive clustering metrics, 87% AUC in novelty detection, and 35% better stability in dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: Configurations offer a brain-inspired AI model for early cognitive categorization.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how subtle design choices in time series foundation models (TSFMs) influence their behavior, focusing on understanding biases rather than outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training process variations affect TSFMs' quality and behavior, avoiding claims of superiority over existing models.

Method: Combines theoretical analysis and controlled empirical evaluation to examine design choices (e.g., patch size, embedding) and their biases.

Result: Identifies intuitive and counterintuitive biases in TSFMs' properties, showing complex interactions in outlier handling and implications for model building.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for careful consideration of design choices in TSFMs and their broader implications for learning and model development.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

*Xuyuan Xiong,Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,Kaixun Hua,Cheng Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOT introduces an efficient MILP-based method for interpretable decision tree policies in MDPs, achieving scalability and speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are crucial for high-stakes decisions, but optimizing decision trees in MDPs is challenging.

Method: SPOT formulates the problem as a MILP and uses a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach, decoupling MDP dynamics from tree-structure constraints for parallel search. This ensures optimal decision trees per iteration.

Result: SPOT achieves substantial speedup, scales to larger MDPs, and produces compact, interpretable policies without performance loss.

Conclusion: SPOT successfully balances interpretability and scalability, delivering high-quality policies faster than existing methods.

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Enhanced SILVER framework improves interpretability of deep RL policies by incorporating RL-guided labeling for multi-action, high-dimensional environments, maintaining performance while boosting transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL lacks interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. Existing SILVER framework is restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains.

Method: Extracts compact features from images, uses SHAP-based attribution, RL-guided labeling for boundary datasets, and trains surrogate models (e.g., decision trees).

Result: Maintains competitive performance while improving transparency and human understanding in Atari environments.

Conclusion: Transforms SILVER into a scalable, behavior-aware framework for explaining deep RL policies in complex settings.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

TL;DR: GraMixC is a plug-and-play module that extracts hierarchical configurations (similar to clustering) and aligns/fuses them for downstream tasks, improving performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To emulate human-like grouping abilities and enhance clustering algorithms by discovering hierarchical configurations without labeled data.

Method: Introduces GraMixC, which extracts configurations, aligns them using RMS, and fuses them via attention heads.

Result: GraMixC boosts R2 scores from 0.6 to 0.9 on the DSN1 task and outperforms baselines on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: GraMixC is effective for hierarchical clustering and adaptable to various tasks, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in GNN-based regression tasks is underexplored, with existing methods focused on classification or representation-level debiasing.

Method: FnRGNN intervenes at three levels: structure-level edge reweighting, representation-level alignment via MMD, and prediction-level normalization using Sinkhorn-based distribution matching.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show FnRGNN reduces group disparities while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: FnRGNN effectively addresses fairness in node-level regression tasks while upholding predictive performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: Gaussian distillation compresses deep ensembles into a student distribution using a deep latent factor model, addressing computational and uncertainty preservation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep ensembles are effective for uncertainty quantification but are computationally intensive, hindering practical use. Existing compression methods struggle to retain uncertainty.

Method: Proposes Gaussian distillation, which compresses a teacher ensemble into a student distribution via a deep latent factor model (DLF), estimated using the EM algorithm.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on benchmark datasets and performs well in fine-tuning language models and handling distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Gaussian distillation efficiently preserves uncertainty while reducing computational costs, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

TL;DR: QiMeng-SALV introduces signal-aware learning for Verilog code generation, optimizing RL training by leveraging functionally correct signal segments. It achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of meaningful functional rewards in RL-based Verilog code generation hinders correctness. QiMeng-SALV addresses this by focusing on signal-level correctness.

Method: The approach verifies signal correctness, uses AST to identify reward segments, and introduces signal-aware DPO for optimization.

Result: Achieves top performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, matching a 671B model with a 7B model.

Conclusion: Signal-level optimization resolves insufficient functional rewards, setting a new standard for Verilog code generation.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) introduce a deterministic latent pathway to preserve distributional information during sampling, improving text generation and reasoning tasks compared to traditional discrete diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the sampling wall issue in discrete diffusion models where categorical sampling collapses distributional information into one-hot vectors, limiting subsequent steps.

Method: Propose Loopholing, a mechanism using a deterministic latent pathway to retain distributional information, trained with self-conditioning.

Result: LDDMs reduce generative perplexity by up to 61%, outperform autoregressive models in some cases, and improve coherence and reasoning task performance.

Conclusion: Loopholing effectively mitigates idle steps and oscillations, enhancing non-autoregressive text generation scalability and quality.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Motivation: Traditional methods for monitoring species distribution have limited coverage and completeness. SDM addresses these gaps but requires improvements for better accuracy.

Method: Used deep learning and data imputation techniques with data from the 'EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge.' Applied data balancing, feature selection, and multimodal ensemble modeling integrating land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs.

Result: Data balancing reduced MAE from 189 to 29 in frog counting. The multimodal ensemble model outperformed individual models, achieving 84.9% accuracy with AUC 0.90.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning and data preprocessing (balancing, imputation) improve ecological modeling accuracy, aiding scalable biodiversity monitoring despite sparse data.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

*Tomer Lavi,Bracha Shapira,Nadav Rappoport*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a calibration pipeline using an ensemble of calibration functions trained on clustered input representations, improving calibration scores significantly and ensuring optimal model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models need reliable predictions for critical decisions, especially in clinical settings, where calibration is often overlooked but crucial.

Method: The proposed method uses an ensemble of calibration functions on clustered input representations to enhance calibration.

Result: The approach improves calibration scores from 82.28% to 100% and introduces a matching metric for balanced model selection.

Conclusion: The flexible and generic scheme outperforms common calibration methods while adapting to various representations, clustering, and metrics.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

TL;DR: The Ring-linear model series introduces efficient hybrid architectures (Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0) combining linear and softmax attention, reducing inference costs significantly and improving training efficiency by 50% with their FP8 operator library.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios by integrating linear and softmax attention mechanisms efficiently.

Method: Developed hybrid architectures (Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0) with systematic exploration of attention mechanism ratios, leveraging a high-performance FP8 operator library (linghe).

Result: Reduced inference cost to 1/10 compared to dense models and over 50% compared to original Ring series. Achieved 50% training efficiency improvement and maintained SOTA performance in complex reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Ring-linear model series offers a cost-effective, efficient solution for long-context inference with optimized hybrid attention architectures and high-performance training tools.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

### [199] [Foundation Model Forecasts: Form and Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19345)
*Alvaro Perez-Diaz,James C. Loach,Danielle E. Toutoungi,Lee Middleton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSFMs often produce limited forecast types (point or parametric), but many operational tasks need trajectory ensembles. Converting forecasts between types is possible only in certain directions, and marginals alone cannot determine path-dependent probabilities. A task-aligned evaluation framework is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to highlight that while time-series foundation models (TSFMs) excel in accuracy, their practical utility is constrained by the forecast type they produce. Many operational tasks require trajectory ensembles, which most TSFMs do not support.

Method: The paper surveys recent TSFMs, analyzes their forecast types, and establishes conditions under which forecast types can be converted. It proves limitations of marginals and introduces a framework mapping tasks to minimal forecast types.

Result: Results show two-thirds of TSFMs produce only point or parametric forecasts, limiting their utility for tasks needing trajectory ensembles. Conversion between forecast types is one-directional without additional assumptions.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes that forecast type, not just accuracy, determines practical utility. A task-aligned evaluation framework is provided to guide model selection based on operational needs.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes BBMDP, a vanilla MDP formulation for variable selection in Branch and Bound (B&B) solvers, leveraging RL algorithms to improve performance. Empirical results show it outperforms existing RL agents on MILP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of B&B solvers heavily depends on variable selection heuristics. Current RL approaches lack principled MDP formulations, prompting the need for a more robust framework like BBMDP.

Method: The authors introduce BBMDP, a vanilla MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, enabling the use of diverse RL algorithms to learn optimal branching policies. Computational experiments validate the model.

Result: BBMDP outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: BBMDP provides a principled and effective approach for learning optimal branching heuristics in B&B, enhancing solver performance.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scalable LinUCB reduces the computational and memory costs of LinUCB by using low-rank matrix approximations for efficient updates and storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LinUCB has high computational and memory costs due to matrix operations, limiting scalability in recommender systems.

Method: Proposes Scalable LinUCB with low-rank parametrization of inverse Cholesky factors, enabling efficient rank-1 and batched updates without full matrix operations.

Result: Achieves O(dr) per-step update cost and memory usage, with efficient inference. Experimental results validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB offers a practical and efficient alternative to traditional LinUCB, enhancing scalability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConvXformer, a hybrid ConvNeXt-Transformer architecture, improves inertial navigation with adaptive differential privacy, achieving 40% better accuracy while protecting sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based inertial tracking systems face privacy risks and performance degradation from excessive noise in existing differential privacy solutions.

Method: ConvXformer combines ConvNeXt blocks and Transformer encoders, using adaptive gradient clipping and gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) for privacy-utility balance.

Result: ConvXformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 40% in positioning accuracy, verified on benchmark datasets and real-world KAIST Mech-IO data.

Conclusion: The framework excels in secure, robust navigation under harsh conditions, making it ideal for cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

Motivation: Evaluate recent optimization techniques for training diffusion models, which are often overlooked in optimization benchmarking.

Method: Benchmark optimization algorithms (Muon, SOAP, AdamW, SGD) on diffusion model training for denoising flow trajectories, analyzing learning-rate schedules and performance gaps.

Result: Muon and SOAP outperform AdamW by reducing final loss by 18%, while learning-rate schedules and Adam vs. SGD performance differences are revisited.

Conclusion: Muon and SOAP are effective alternatives to AdamW for diffusion models, with broader insights applicable to training dynamics.

Abstract: The training of diffusion models is often absent in the evaluation of new

algorithms for training a diffusion model for denoising flow trajectories. We
observe that Muon and SOAP are highly efficient alternatives to AdamW (18%

### [204] [LMFD: Latent Monotonic Feature Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19383)
*Guus Toussaint,Arno Knobbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extract monotonic proxies for 'age' from multi-variate time series by optimizing sensor combinations for monotonicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many systems degrade over time, but direct 'age' data is often unavailable. The goal is to find latent 'age' proxies from sensor data.

Method: A grammar-based approach optimizes equations for monotonicity (using Spearman's Rank Correlation) to combine low-monotonicity sensors into high-monotonicity features.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., InfraWatch) show successful creation of interpretable proxies, with Spearman's ρ improving from 0.13/0.09 to 0.95.

Conclusion: The method effectively derives interpretable 'age' proxies from sensor data, even when individual sensors lack monotonicity.

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner is a dynamic graph-text alignment framework that adapts to varying data quality, outperforming existing methods in robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-text aligners struggle with many-to-many relations and noisy supervision, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: ADAligner dynamically adjusts between many-to-many and one-to-one alignment objectives based on real-time supervision quality estimates.

Result: ADAligner achieves superior performance on tasks like node classification and link prediction, with improved robustness and faster pre-training.

Conclusion: ADAligner provides a scalable and reliable solution for graph-text representation learning in noisy, real-world environments.

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Li,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPSVD improves LLM compression by selectively preserving high-error matrix columns and applying SVD to low-error columns, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVD-based methods ignore varying decomposition errors across matrix parts, leading to suboptimal LLM compression.

Method: CPSVD segments the parameter matrix, preserving high-error columns and applying SVD to low-error ones, optimizing compression balance.

Result: CPSVD achieves lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CPSVD is a superior SVD-based compression technique for LLMs, offering adaptive and efficient performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

### [207] [ARA: Adaptive Rank Allocation for Efficient Large Language Model SVD Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19389)
*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Adaptive Rank Allocation (ARA) method to improve SVD-based compression of large language models by addressing limitations in existing heuristic and mask-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression suffer from restricted solution spaces, inefficient relationships between singular value spectra and parameters, and suboptimal local minima due to non-smooth gain functions.

Method: ARA introduces a specialized mask design for efficient rank-parameter mapping and an additional loss function to guide globally optimal parameter selection.

Result: On LLaMA2-7B with 80% compression, ARA reduces perplexity from 8.38 to 6.42 on WikiText2 and improves zero-shot accuracy by 9.72 points over uniform compression.

Conclusion: ARA outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for SVD-based LLM compression.

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IFeF-PINN addresses spectral bias in PINNs by iteratively training with Fourier-enhanced features, improving high-frequency PDE approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often prioritize low-frequency features, limiting their effectiveness in physics-informed tasks. Addressing this spectral bias is crucial for accurate solutions.

Method: The proposed IFeF-PINN algorithm uses Random Fourier Features to enrich the latent space, enabling iterative training with enhanced high-frequency components.

Result: The method shows improved approximation across frequencies, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in benchmark problems.

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN effectively mitigates spectral bias, enhancing the expressive capacity of PINNs for high-frequency PDE solutions.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

*Songqi Zhou,Zeyuan Liu,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet is a dynamic framework addressing fairness in machine learning by selectively correcting biased instances using conditional LoRA and a contrastive loss function, while preserving performance on unbiased instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods often degrade model performance, rely on static strategies, and inadequately handle sensitive attributes or data sparsity, especially for minority groups.

Method: FairNet combines a bias detector with conditional LoRA for instance-level correction, using a novel contrastive loss to reduce representation disparities across sensitive groups.

Result: Empirical evaluations show FairNet improves fairness without compromising overall performance, even with incomplete sensitive attribute labels.

Conclusion: FairNet offers a flexible and effective solution for dynamic fairness correction in machine learning models, validated across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

### [210] [LLM Unlearning with LLM Beliefs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19422)
*Kemou Li,Qizhou Wang,Yue Wang,Fengpeng Li,Jun Liu,Bo Han,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of sensitive content memorized by large language models and critiques existing unlearning methods for redistributing probability mass into semantically related rephrasings (the squeezing effect). It proposes a bootstrapping framework (BS) to counteract this by targeting high-confidence model beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods fail to effectively remove sensitive content due to the squeezing effect, where probability mass shifts to semantically related rephrasings.

Method: Proposes a bootstrapping framework (BS-T and BS-S) that jointly suppresses target responses and model beliefs to counteract the squeezing effect.

Result: Experiments show BS-T attenuates high-probability tokens, and BS-S removes entire high-confidence generations, achieving thorough forgetting while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The BS framework effectively counters the squeezing effect, improving unlearning outcomes compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NVDPs introduce a Bayesian meta-learning approach using task-specific dropout rates for efficient adaptation in few-shot learning, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve robustness in meta-learning by modeling the conditional posterior distribution with task-specific dropout rates.

Method: NVDPs employ a low-rank product of Bernoulli experts meta-model for memory-efficient dropout rate mapping and use amortized variational inference with a novel prior.

Result: NVDPs outperform other meta-learning approaches in tasks like stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.

Conclusion: NVDPs provide a robust and efficient solution for few-shot learning by leveraging task-specific dropout rates and variational inference.

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

### [212] [Revisiting the Relation Between Robustness and Universality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19427)
*M. Klabunde,L. Caspari,F. Lemmerich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits Jones et al.'s universality hypothesis, finding limited applicability across datasets and no predictive universality, though retraining classifiers improves consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the generality of Jones et al.'s claim about adversarial robustness leading to highly similar models.

Method: Re-examining the hypothesis across diverse datasets, analyzing representational and predictive behavior, and retraining classifiers.

Result: Representational similarity holds in specific settings, but predictive behavior doesn't universally converge. Retraining classifiers improves consistency.

Conclusion: Neural networks exhibit partial universality in specific settings, rejecting strict universality.

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

*Constance Ferragu,Jonathan D. Ziegler,Nicolas Deutschmann,Arthur Lindoulsi,Eli Bixby,Cradle ML Team*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: g-DPO addresses DPO's scalability issue by clustering sequences and using group-based approximations, achieving similar performance with faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's scalability bottleneck due to quadratic growth of training pairs limits its practicality for protein language models.

Method: g-DPO introduces sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs and amortizes likelihood computations with group-based approximations.

Result: g-DPO maintains performance comparable to DPO while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster across three protein engineering tasks.

Conclusion: g-DPO offers a scalable alternative to DPO without sacrificing effectiveness, with potential for greater efficiency gains in larger datasets.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

### [214] [A Concrete Roadmap towards Safety Cases based on Chain-of-Thought Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19476)
*Julian Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a roadmap for ensuring AI safety through chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring, addressing threats like neuralese and encoded reasoning, and evaluating techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems near dangerous capability levels, traditional safety cases become insufficient, necessitating alternative approaches like CoT monitoring.

Method: The paper outlines a two-part safety case: (1) ensuring models lack dangerous capabilities without CoT, and (2) detecting dangerous capabilities enabled by CoT. It examines threats like neuralese and encoded reasoning, categorizes them, and evaluates techniques for CoT faithfulness.

Result: The study explores extracting monitorable CoT from non-monitorable reasoning and uses prediction markets to assess the feasibility of CoT monitoring safety cases.

Conclusion: CoT monitoring could support both control and trustworthiness safety cases, but challenges like neuralese and encoded reasoning must be addressed.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

### [215] [Graph Unlearning Meets Influence-aware Negative Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19479)
*Qiang Chen,Zhongze Wu,Ang He,Xi Lin,Shuo Jiang,Shan You,Chang Xu,Yi Chen,Xiu Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INPO is an Influence-aware Negative Preference Optimization framework designed to slow divergence speed and improve robustness in graph unlearning models by focusing on high-influence edges and using topological entropy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gradient ascent methods in graph unlearning cause rapid divergence and degrade model utility. INPO aims to address this by enhancing robustness and slowing divergence.

Method: INPO uses an influence-aware message function to amplify unlearned edges' impact, estimates edge influence via removal-based methods, and introduces topological entropy loss to preserve local structure.

Result: Experiments on five datasets show INPO achieves top performance in forget quality metrics while maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: INPO effectively improves graph unlearning by balancing divergence speed and utility, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

### [216] [ELUTQ: Efficient LUT-Aware Quantization for Deploying Large Language Models on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19482)
*Xin Nie,Liang Dong,HaiCheng Zhang,JiaWang Xiao,G. Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ introduces HLQ for efficient LLM quantization on CPUs, reducing memory and latency without dequantization overhead, achieving high performance at low bit widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient deployment of LLMs on CPU-based edge devices by addressing memory and computational constraints.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ) to capture weight statistics and optimized CPU kernels for inference.

Result: HLQ reduces perplexity by 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit, achieving 25 tokens/s on M2 chips.

Conclusion: ELUTQ is a scalable, efficient framework for low-bit LLM deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

*Chenyu Wang,Zhanglu Yan,Zhi Zhou,Xu Chen,Weng-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpikeQuant introduces mixed-precision quantization for LLMs, leveraging SNNs' efficiency to reduce energy costs and maintain accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantization methods for LLMs still face high energy consumption from MAC operations, dequantization overhead, and impractical mixed-precision storage.

Method: SpikeQuant re-encodes activations into binary spike counts and embeds quantization scales into IF thresholds, avoiding explicit dequantization.

Result: Achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization while reducing energy by up to 4.6× compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SpikeQuant enables accurate and energy-efficient LLM deployment by combining mixed-precision quantization with SNN principles.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

*Demian Till,John Smeaton,Peter Haubrick,Gouse Saheb,Florian Graef,David Berman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extending consistency-based hallucination detection from single LLMs to multiple LLMs improves performance and reduces costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases and under-representation in LLM training data by leveraging diverse models.

Method: Combine responses from multiple LLMs with different training data and architectures (consortium consistency).

Result: Substantial improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation, often with reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: Consortium consistency outperforms single-model methods and is cost-effective.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

*Maciej Mozolewski,Betül Bayrak,Kerstin Bach,Grzegorz J. Nalepa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations in XAI for ECG classification, achieving high validity and temporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing explainability challenges in state-of-the-art models for actionable insights in healthcare.

Method: Uses SHAP-based thresholds, DTW, medoid clustering, and R-peak alignment to create coherent counterfactuals.

Result: Achieves 81.3% validity, 43% temporal stability improvement, and near real-time generation (<1 second).

Conclusion: Establishes design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactuals and outlines pathways for clinical deployment.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

*Shuli Zhang,Hao Zhou,Jiaqi Zheng,Guibin Jiang,Bing Cheng,Wei Lin,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bi-DFCL addresses prediction-decision misalignment and bias-variance challenges in marketing optimization by combining unbiased experimental data with biased observational data through bi-level optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML and OR pipelines fail to align prediction accuracy with optimization goals and struggle with biases in observational data and scarcity of experimental data.

Method: Bi-DFCL uses an unbiased OR decision estimator and surrogate loss functions for ML training, alongside a bi-level framework leveraging both data types via implicit differentiation.

Result: Bi-DFCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks, industrial datasets, and real-world A/B tests, and is deployed at Meituan.

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL effectively bridges ML and OR, optimizing marketing decisions by balancing bias-variance tradeoffs.

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REBMBO combines Gaussian Processes and Energy-Based Models into a reinforced Bayesian Optimization framework, addressing one-step bias and improving performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian Optimization methods suffer from one-step bias, leading to local optima convergence. Black-Box Optimization successes inspire integrating GP and EBM for better global exploration.

Method: REBMBO uses GP for local guidance and EBM for global structure, framing BO iterations as MDPs solved with Proximal Policy Optimization for adaptive multi-step lookahead.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show REBMBO outperforms traditional BO methods, with robustness across GP configurations.

Conclusion: REBMBO effectively overcomes one-step bias limitations, demonstrating superior adaptability and performance in Bayesian Optimization.

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MED-LQ, a novel model-based reinforcement learning method for controlling linear systems with quadratic cost under unknown dynamics. It outperforms traditional methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling by leveraging the Confusing Instance principle and extending it to large-scale settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for controlling linear systems with unknown dynamics have practical limitations. The authors aim to overcome these by applying the Confusing Instance principle, which is central to achieving asymptotic optimality in multi-armed bandits and discrete Markov Decision Processes.

Method: The authors develop MED-LQ, a control strategy that combines the Confusing Instance principle with the structure of LQR policies, sensitivity, and stability analysis. This extends the applicability of MED algorithms beyond small-scale settings.

Result: Benchmarks show that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance across diverse scenarios, demonstrating its scalability and potential for broader applications in large-scale Markov Decision Processes.

Conclusion: MED-LQ offers a scalable and effective alternative to traditional methods for controlling linear systems with quadratic cost under unknown dynamics, with promising results for large-scale applications.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores federated clustering methods to address challenges in analyzing distributed molecular data in drug discovery, benchmarking three approaches and introducing a chemistry-informed metric for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of AI methods on limited public datasets hinders their industrial application in drug discovery. Federated learning can integrate private data but complicates data-centric tasks like diversity analysis.

Method: The study benchmarks federated clustering methods (Fed-kMeans, Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans, Fed-LSH) against centralized counterparts using eight molecular datasets and introduces SF-ICF for evaluation.

Result: Benchmarking highlights the need for domain-specific metrics and on-client explainability to effectively analyze federated molecular data.

Conclusion: Incorporating chemistry-informed metrics and explainability analyses improves federated diversity analysis, advancing AI applications in drug discovery.

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

TL;DR: ForecastNet-XCL is a hybrid deep learning model combining XGBoost, CNN, and BiLSTM for multi-week RSV forecasting, outperforming baselines and enhancing accuracy with climate and temporal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the underexplored use of ML models for forecasting endemic diseases like RSV, leveraging climate and temporal data without real-time surveillance.

Method: ForecastNet-XCL integrates high-resolution feature learning, long-range temporal dependency capturing, and an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations. Stochastic inference provides probabilistic intervals.

Result: Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensembles, maintaining accuracy over extended horizons. Generalization improved with climatologically diverse datasets.

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and uncertainty-aware design make it a viable early-warning tool for RSV forecasting amid climate pressures and limited surveillance resources.

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

*Jin Han,Zhe Zheng,Yi Gu,Jia-Rui Lin,Xin-Zheng Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffEvac proposes a generative model-based method for efficient evacuation simulation, improving accuracy and speed over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evacuation simulation relies on complex modeling, making it impractical for rapid design iterations. DiffEvac aims to address this by leveraging generative models.

Method: The study uses a dataset of building layouts and evacuation heatmaps, proposes a decoupled feature representation, and trains a diffusion model to learn evacuation patterns.

Result: DiffEvac outperforms Conditional GANs with significant improvements in SSIM (37.6%), PSNR (142%), and speed (16x faster), reducing simulation time to 2 minutes.

Conclusion: DiffEvac enhances rapid design iterations, lowers modeling burden, and provides new pathways for safety optimization in intelligent building design.

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the untapped potential of least squares in machine learning, transforming it into a differentiable operator for diverse applications like scalability, constraints, and hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and expand the use of least squares beyond linear models by making it a versatile, differentiable tool in modern machine learning.

Method: Derives custom gradients to convert least squares solvers into differentiable operators, akin to neural network layers.

Result: Demonstrates scalability (50M parameters), conservativeness constraints in generative models, and Gaussian process hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The work advances differentiable linear-algebra tools, making them more accessible and applicable in machine learning.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

*Shashi Kumar,Yacouba Kaloga,John Mitros,Petr Motlicek,Ina Kodrasi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FVAE-LoRA improves upon standard LoRA by using a VAE to separate task-salient and residual features, enhancing performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of explicit disambiguation of task-relevant information in existing LoRA variants, which limits downstream performance.

Method: Proposes Factorized Variational Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), using a VAE with two distinct latent spaces: one for task-salient features and another for residual information.

Result: Outperforms standard LoRA across text, audio, and image tasks and shows better robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA effectively isolates task-relevant signals, improving performance and robustness compared to standard LoRA.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

### [228] [Overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner for treatment effect estimation over time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19643)
*Konstantin Hess,Dennis Frauen,Mihaela van der Schaar,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner is introduced to address challenges in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings with low treatment overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-learners assume adequate treatment overlap, leading to high estimation variance when overlap is low, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Developed an overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner targeting high-probability treatment sequences, using Neyman-orthogonal population risk minimization.

Result: The WO-learner demonstrates robustness against nuisance function misspecification and performs well with transformer and LSTM models.

Conclusion: The WO-learner provides reliable HTE estimates in low-overlap scenarios and is adaptable to various machine learning models.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

*Ayush Sawarni,Jikai Jin,Justin Whitehouse,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy learning with abstention allows deferring decisions when uncertain, enhancing safety and performance in high-stakes settings with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing uncertainty in policy learning to avoid risky decisions, especially in critical areas like personalized medicine and advertising.

Method: Proposes a two-stage learner: first identifies near-optimal policies, then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. Uses doubly robust objectives for unknown propensities.

Result: Achieves fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees with known propensities; extends to unknown propensities via DR. Abstention improves guarantees under margin conditions and supports safe policy improvement.

Conclusion: Abstention is a versatile tool enhancing policy learning by mitigating uncertainty, improving robustness, and ensuring safe policy updates.

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

TL;DR: TraDy is a memory-efficient transfer learning method using dynamic stochastic channel selection, improving performance under strict memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for memory-efficient training of large deep neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Proposes TraDy, leveraging architecture-dependent layer importance and dynamic stochastic channel selection for gradient approximation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% FLOPs reduction.

Conclusion: TraDy effectively balances performance and memory efficiency, making it suitable for resource-limited deployment.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict
resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme
leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative
computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion Caching introduces a training-free, architecture-agnostic method to reduce computational overhead in Diffusion Models, evolving from static reuse to dynamic prediction for efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational inefficiency and latency issues in Diffusion Models to enable real-time applications.

Method: Feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling to identify and reduce redundancies without modifying model parameters.

Result: Enhances caching flexibility and integrates with other acceleration techniques, improving efficiency.

Conclusion: Diffusion Caching is poised to become a key enabler for real-time, efficient generative AI.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

*Amir Globerson,Haim Kaplan,Yishay Mansour,Clara Mohri,Tal Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HSD reduces inference latency in transformer models by using a hierarchy of draft models for token proposals and verification, achieving up to 1.2x speed-up over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the latency issue in autoregressive text generation by leveraging multiple draft models efficiently.

Method: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) employs a hierarchy of draft models where each proposes tokens, and larger models verify them in parallel, optimizing latency.

Result: HSD achieves up to a 1.2x speed-up compared to single-draft baselines, reducing generation latency effectively.

Conclusion: HSD is a practical and efficient method for improving text generation latency by utilizing a hierarchical draft model approach.

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

### [233] [SEMPO: Lightweight Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19710)
*Hui He,Kun Yi,Yuanchi Ma,Qi Zhang,Zhendong Niu,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO is a lightweight foundation model for time series forecasting, reducing pre-training data and model size while maintaining strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the tension between versatility and affordability in large pre-trained models for time series forecasting.

Method: SEMPO uses energy-aware spectral decomposition and mixture-of-prompts enabled Transformer for efficient data utilization and parameter adaptation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting on 16 datasets.

Conclusion: SEMPO offers a resource-efficient solution with strong performance for time series forecasting.

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available

TL;DR: A novel framework uses enhanced synthetic ICU time-series data to train and evaluate predictive models, reducing the gap between synthetic and real data evaluations and improving subgroup-level performance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable trustworthy and granular evaluation of predictive models in critical care without exposing sensitive EHR data.

Method: Introduces Enhanced TimeAutoDiff, augmenting latent diffusion with distribution-alignment penalties, and benchmarks it against other models on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets.

Result: Reduces the TRTS gap by over 70%, improves subgroup-level AUROC estimation, and outperforms small real test sets in most subgroups.

Conclusion: Provides a privacy-preserving, practical approach for robust performance analysis across diverse patient populations, enhancing Medical AI trustworthiness.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen bounds for SGD in a growing-dimensional regime, improving computational efficiency and dimensional scaling compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous uncertainty quantification for SGD in high-stakes applications by addressing computational and scaling limitations of existing methods.

Method: Develops online least-squares SGD with non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen bounds and introduces an online variance estimator for practical applicability.

Result: Achieves a CLT for SGD iterates with near-optimal scaling (t ≳ d^{1+δ}) and reduces runtime/memory requirements compared to covariance-inversion methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a computationally efficient, fully online method for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

TL;DR: The paper proposes BATIS, a Bayesian deep learning framework for species distribution models (SDMs) to address spatial biases, improving reliability in data-scarce areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance SDMs by leveraging Bayesian deep learning to handle spatial biases and uncertainty in species occurrence predictions.

Method: Introduces BATIS, a framework combining Bayesian approaches with deep learning to iteratively update predictions using limited observational data.

Result: Empirical benchmarking shows BATIS improves SDM reliability, especially in data-scarce regions, using citizen science data.

Conclusion: Bayesian deep learning can significantly improve SDMs' effectiveness for ecological understanding and conservation.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

*Qilin Ye,Deqing Fu,Robin Jia,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers rely on brittle heuristics instead of generalizable algorithms, especially in graph connectivity tasks. Theoretical and empirical analysis shows their capacity is limited to graphs with diameters up to 3^L.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms and instead use brittle heuristics, focusing on graph connectivity as a testbed.

Method: Simplified Transformer architecture (disentangled Transformer) analyzed theoretically and empirically, examining its capacity for solving graph connectivity problems.

Result: Transformers can solve graphs with diameters ≤ 3^L, learning correct algorithms within their capacity but reverting to heuristics (node degrees) beyond it.

Conclusion: Restricting training data within a Transformer's capacity ensures learning of exact algorithms rather than heuristics.

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX is a novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using Conformal Prediction and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, ensuring reliable and actionable explanations with local coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods often neglect predictive uncertainty or lack formal guarantees, leading to potentially unreliable explanations. CONFEX aims to address this gap.

Method: CONFEX combines Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to generate uncertainty-aware explanations. It uses a tree-based partitioning of the input space for efficient MILP encoding and provides local coverage guarantees.

Result: CONFEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks, demonstrating robust and plausible explanations with rigorous guarantees on predictive uncertainty and optimality.

Conclusion: CONFEX successfully integrates uncertainty-awareness into counterfactual explanations, offering actionable and interpretable results with formal guarantees.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

*Euodia Dodd,Nataša Krčo,Igor Shilov,Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to estimate AI models' vulnerability to membership inference attacks (MIAs) without needing computationally expensive reference models, by analyzing loss distribution patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MIA evaluation methods require training many reference models, which is impractical. The study aims to simplify this process by focusing on loss distribution asymmetry.

Method: The method estimates vulnerability by analyzing the absence of outliers in high-loss regions of training and testing distributions, using a simple loss attack (TNR).

Result: The proposed method accurately predicts model-level vulnerability to SOTA MIA attacks (LiRA) and outperforms low-cost alternatives like RMIA.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical and efficient way to assess MIA risks, with potential applications in large-language models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP is a novel sparse fine-tuning technique that optimizes parameter selection for LLMs, improving performance and stability while reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse fine-tuning methods lack optimal parameter selection, limiting their effectiveness. GaLLoP addresses this by focusing on task-relevant yet minimally disruptive parameters.

Method: GaLLoP fine-tunes parameters with the largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and smallest pre-trained magnitudes, balancing task relevance and pre-trained knowledge preservation.

Result: GaLLoP matches or outperforms leading techniques (LoRA, DoRA, SAFT) in in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, with improved generalization and stability.

Conclusion: GaLLoP enhances sparse fine-tuning by optimally selecting parameters, mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and stabilizing performance across diverse tasks and models.

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

TL;DR: DynaInfer is a novel method for inferring environment specifications from prediction errors in dynamical systems, outperforming existing techniques even without environment labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for generalization techniques in complex dynamical systems is hindered by the unavailability of environment labels due to data challenges and privacy concerns.

Method: DynaInfer infers environment specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks during training, enabling direct data-based environment assignments.

Result: Experiments show DynaInfer outperforms existing techniques, converges to true labels quickly, and performs better even with labels available.

Conclusion: DynaInfer provides an effective solution for environment assignment in unlabeled scenarios, enhancing robustness in dynamical system analysis.

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

TL;DR: Alice investigates if Bob uses her model by testing statistical correlations between Bob's outputs and her randomized training data order, achieving strong evidence in most cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if Bob's derivative model or text relies on Alice's original model, framed as an independence testing problem.

Method: Uses palimpsestic memorization to test correlations between Bob's outputs and Alice's training data order, with two settings: query (direct prompting) and observational (likelihood estimation).

Result: In query setting, p-values as low as 1e-8 show strong evidence. Observational setting requires fewer tokens for reliable detection with the second approach.

Conclusion: Alice can effectively prove Bob's reliance on her model using statistical correlations derived from her randomized training data.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

### [243] [Transformers are almost optimal metalearners for linear classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19797)
*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper theoretically analyzes whether transformers can act as metalearners in linear classification, showing they perform nearly optimally with minimal in-context examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore transformers' potential as metalearners adapting to new tasks efficiently using in-context learning, addressing gaps in prior theoretical work.

Method: Analyzes a simplified transformer trained via gradient descent in a linear classification setting with tasks based on Gaussian mixtures in a shared subspace.

Result: The transformer generalizes to new tasks with significantly fewer in-context examples (O(k/R^4)) than non-metalearners (Ω(d/R^4)), nearly matching optimal performance.

Conclusion: Transformers can effectively metalearn in linear settings, requiring minimal training tasks and examples independent of ambient dimension.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility of training large language models in Brazil and Mexico under hardware, energy, and budget constraints, comparing costs and efficiency of NVIDIA H100 and A100 accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address structural asymmetries in AI capacity by enabling middle-income countries to train sovereign-scale language models sustainably.

Method: Dual-axis design comparing accelerator generations (H100 vs. A100) and training durations (90 vs. 150 days) for estimating compute, energy, and fiscal costs.

Result: H100-based training is fiscally viable at 8-14 million USD, while A100 costs 19-32 million USD. Longer timelines mitigate hardware constraints.

Conclusion: Policy-driven extensions of training timelines can enable sustainable, locally aligned AI capabilities in middle-income countries.

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

*Jacob Berg,Chuning Zhu,Yanda Bao,Ishan Durugkar,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using semantic predictions instead of pixel reconstruction in world models for robotic planning, leveraging vision-language models for improved generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional world models focus on pixel reconstruction, which may not align with planning objectives. Predicting task-relevant semantic information is proposed as a better alternative.

Method: The approach frames world modeling as a visual question answering problem, using supervised finetuning of vision-language models on image-action-text data.

Result: The semantic world model shows significant generalization improvements in open-ended robotics tasks compared to reconstruction-based methods.

Conclusion: Semantic predictions outperform pixel reconstruction in world modeling for robotic planning, benefiting from the robustness and generalization of vision-language models.

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Debabrota Basu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the interplay among generator coverage, verifier ROC, and sampling sub-optimality in test-time scaling for LLMs, framing it as a transport problem and identifying three distinct regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored role of verifiers and their imperfections in LLM performance improvements during test-time scaling.

Method: The authors frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem, analyze interactions of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and propose sequential and batched sampling algorithms.

Result: Three regimes emerge: transport (sub-optimality increases with coverage), policy improvement (sub-optimality may decrease with coverage), and saturation (plateaued sub-optimality). Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models support theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The unified framework clarifies the geometry of interplay among key factors in test-time scaling, offering insights for optimizing LLM performance.

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

*Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACTMED integrates Bayesian Experimental Design and LLMs to optimize clinical test selection dynamically, improving diagnostic accuracy and resource use without requiring structured training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML approaches for clinical diagnosis rely on static datasets and don't reflect clinicians' sequential, resource-aware reasoning, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings.

Method: ACTMED uses Bayesian Experimental Design and LLMs to simulate patient states and select tests reducing diagnostic uncertainty step-by-step, keeping clinicians involved.

Result: Evaluation shows ACTMED improves diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use, generalizing across settings with less domain-specific data.

Conclusion: ACTMED advances transparent, adaptive diagnostic systems aligned with clinicians' workflows and adaptable to diverse settings.

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

*Brandon James Carone,Iran R. Roman,Pablo Ripollés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MUSE Benchmark to evaluate relational reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for music understanding, revealing significant performance gaps between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of MLLMs overlook weaknesses in relational reasoning for audio understanding, prompting the need for a targeted benchmark.

Method: The MUSE Benchmark with 10 tasks was used to assess four SOTA models against a human baseline, analyzing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting effects.

Result: Models showed wide performance variance, with some performing near chance, and CoT prompting was inconsistent or detrimental.

Conclusion: The MUSE Benchmark is a critical tool for identifying AI weaknesses in music perception and improving model robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLM agents can replicate human online social dynamics like homophily and reciprocity. It introduces a simulation framework with behavioral rewards and in-context learning to study emergent network structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLM agents can mimic human social behaviors online and identify the mechanisms enabling such dynamics.

Method: A multi-agent LLM simulation framework with behavioral rewards (social interaction, information seeking, etc.) and in-context learning guided by coaching signals.

Result: Coached LLM agents form stable interaction patterns and social ties, mirroring real online communities.

Conclusion: The framework provides a testbed for studying collective dynamics in LLM populations and compares artificial agents' social behavior to humans.

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify LLMs' ability to evaluate clinical trial reporting and understand their cognitive and reasoning strategies in healthcare.

Method: A behavioral and metacognitive analytic approach was used, comparing two LLMs under three prompt conditions with expert-validated data.

Result: Differences emerged in how LLMs handled CONSORT items and prompts, affecting reasoning styles, uncertainty, and interpretations.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' limitations in clinical compliance automation and stresses the need for understanding their cognitive adaptations for reliable medical AI.

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic

*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp introduces an expert-level e-commerce benchmark to evaluate deep search agents' ability to apply hierarchical rules like HSCodes, revealing significant performance gaps between agents and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks overlook agents' critical capability to apply complex rules with vague boundaries and implicit logic, essential for tasks like predicting HSCodes.

Method: HSCodeComp is built from real-world e-commerce data, featuring 632 product entries annotated by experts, testing agents' hierarchical rule application via noisy descriptions.

Result: State-of-the-art agents achieve only 46.8% accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%, highlighting challenges in hierarchical rule application.

Conclusion: HSCodeComp underscores the need for improved agent benchmarks and capabilities in hierarchical rule application for realistic tasks.

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores Mode Selection and Early Exit methods to reduce computational overhead in reasoning models. Mode Selection, harder than Early Exit, requires zero-step thinking, while existing methods struggle with limited information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency caused by overthinking in reasoning models by optimizing decision-making between Long-CoT and Short-CoT modes and stopping points.

Method: Introduces Mode Selection (zero-step thinking) and Early Exit, comparing nine baselines, including prompt-based and internal-information approaches.

Result: Prompt-based methods underperform due to limited classification, while internal-information methods, though better, lack stability. Existing methods fall short in low-information scenarios.

Conclusion: Mode Selection remains challenging, highlighting inadequacies of current methods and the need for improved approaches to optimize reasoning model efficiency.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

TL;DR: WebGraphEval introduces a graph-based framework for evaluating web agents, capturing diversity and structural insights beyond binary success metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for web agents are limited to binary success or single trajectories, ignoring structural diversity in benchmarks.

Method: The framework abstracts trajectories into weighted action graphs, encoding actions canonically, merging recurring behaviors, and applying structural analyses like reward propagation.

Result: Evaluations across thousands of trajectories show the graph captures cross-model regularities, highlights inefficiencies, and identifies critical decision points.

Conclusion: WebGraphEval provides a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

TL;DR: The study compares ChatGPT's performance in the legal domain against Regex, revealing its limitations in assembling knowledge and reasoning exhaustively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess ChatGPT's capability in handling complex legal tasks like extracting key passages from legal decisions, compared to Regex.

Method: Conducted an experiment comparing ChatGPT's output with Regex in the legal domain, focusing on knowledge assembly and reasoning.

Result: ChatGPT fails to comprehensively assemble knowledge and reason through legal tasks, highlighting its limitations compared to human intelligence.

Conclusion: Human intelligence remains superior in legal reasoning, as AI lacks comprehensive understanding and unified problem-solving.

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores extending the DSA-framework to provide argumentative explanations for inconsistent precedents in AI and Law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precedential constraint assumes consistency, but real-world precedents can be inconsistent. This gap necessitates a method for argumentative explanations in such cases.

Method: The paper examines an extension of the Derivation State Argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to accommodate inconsistent precedents.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the focus is on developing a method for explaining reasoning with inconsistent precedents.

Conclusion: The study addresses the lack of argumentative explanation methods for inconsistent precedents by proposing an extension to the DSA-framework.

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

TL;DR: CKA-RL addresses catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization in continual reinforcement learning by introducing a dynamic knowledge adaptation strategy and adaptive knowledge merging mechanism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are non-stationary, requiring continuous adaptation by agents. Existing continual reinforcement learning methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization.

Method: Proposes Continual Knowledge Adaptation (CKA-RL) with a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamic historical knowledge usage, alongside an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism for scalability.

Result: Experiments show CKA-RL improves overall performance by 4.20% and forward transfer by 8.02% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CKA-RL effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances knowledge transfer in continual reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate tools in isolation, missing challenges like functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly optimistic results. MSC-Bench aims to provide a more objective assessment.

Method: MSC-Bench uses 'equal function sets' to construct ground truth, employs metrics like F1 score, and reduces dependency on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. It tests agents across five levels, from single-tool use to complex cross-server planning and robustness.

Result: Experiments show rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and even top agents struggle with robustness. MSC-Bench exposes these weaknesses systematically.

Conclusion: MSC-Bench offers a diagnostic framework to improve tool-using agents' capabilities and efficiency, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at
https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

### [258] [NeSyPr: Neurosymbolic Proceduralization For Efficient Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19429)
*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr is a neurosymbolic proceduralization framework that enhances LM-based agents for embodied tasks by compiling symbolic plans into procedural representations, enabling efficient, single-step inference without external symbolic guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in adapting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks in dynamic environments with latency, connectivity, and resource constraints, necessitating a solution that avoids reliance on large-scale inference engines or symbolic planners.

Method: NeSyPr generates task-specific symbolic plans, transforms them into composable procedural representations, and integrates these into LM inference, abstracting multi-step reasoning into single-step processes.

Result: NeSyPr outperforms large-scale reasoning models and symbolic planners on benchmarks like PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, using more compact LMs.

Conclusion: NeSyPr provides adaptive and efficient reasoning for embodied tasks, suitable for latency-sensitive and resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning) introduces a distributional policy and semantic alignment to tackle ambiguity in language instructions, improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguity in linguistic instructions for intelligent agents to enhance task understanding and execution.

Method: DAIL combines a distributional policy for value distribution estimation and a semantic alignment module to link trajectories with instructions.

Result: Experiments show DAIL outperforms baselines in resolving instruction ambiguities on structured and visual benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAIL effectively improves algorithmic performance by mitigating linguistic ambiguity through distributional and alignment techniques.

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

*Xusen Guo,Mingxing Peng,Xixuan Hao,Xingchen Zou,Qiongyan Wang,Sijie Ruan,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense integrates LLMs into urban sensing for better adaptability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban sensing systems lack generalization and interpretability.

Method: AgentSense uses LLMs in a multi-agent system to refine task assignments dynamically.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods and single-agent LLMs in adaptability and explainability.

Conclusion: AgentSense advances adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems.

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

*Matthew Keating,Michael Casey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based engine computes chord tone soloing suggestions for guitar students by generating arpeggios, constructing a weighted graph, and finding optimal transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chord tone soloing is fundamental for jazz improvisation but challenging to learn. The paper aims to simplify this practice for guitar students.

Method: Generates chord-tone arpeggios, constructs a weighted graph (nodes as arpeggios), calculates edge weights for optimal transitions, and finds the shortest path to create soloing lines.

Result: A system provides user-friendly chord tone soloing suggestions for practice.

Conclusion: The engine effectively aids guitar students in learning chord tone soloing through structured graph-based computations.

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

*Silvia García-Méndez,Francisco de Arriba-Pérez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An explainable AI solution for real-time win prediction in e-sports achieves over 90% accuracy, outperforming existing methods and enhancing decision-making with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of e-sports and cloud computing has driven the need for advanced analytics, but existing win prediction methods lack real-time processing and visualization.

Method: The proposed solution uses sliding windows to analyze streaming data, focusing on explainable classification for dynamic game changes.

Result: Experiments show over 90% accuracy, outperforming competing solutions.

Conclusion: The system aids decision-making in ranking and recommender systems by providing trustworthy, explainable predictions.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

### [263] [RLIE: Rule Generation with Logistic Regression, Iterative Refinement, and Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19698)
*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE integrates LLMs with probabilistic rule learning to create weighted rules, outperforming LLM-based prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored opportunity of combining LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust inference.

Method: RLIE involves four stages: rule generation, logistic regression for weight learning, iterative refinement, and evaluation.

Result: Directly applying weighted rules outperforms prompting LLMs with rules, highlighting LLMs' limitations in probabilistic tasks.

Conclusion: RLIE demonstrates the synergy of LLMs and probabilistic methods, clarifying their roles in neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

### [264] [Memo: Training Memory-Efficient Embodied Agents with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19732)
*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo is a transformer-based architecture for RL tasks, introducing memory creation and retrieval to handle long-horizon tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based policies struggle with visual input overload and lack efficient memory mechanisms, unlike humans who utilize compressed memories.

Method: Memo interleaves summarization tokens with inputs during training to create and retrieve memory, tested on gridworld and navigation tasks.

Result: Memo outperforms naive long-context transformers, is more efficient, and generalizes better to longer contexts while remaining robust.

Conclusion: Memo provides an effective solution for memory-intensive RL tasks, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

*Gil Pasternak,Dheeraj Rajagopal,Julia White,Dhruv Atreja,Matthew Thomas,George Hurn-Maloney,Ash Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PROBE to evaluate LLM-based agents' proactivity, finding current models struggle with a 40% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for proactive LLM agents lack the ability to test reasoning across diverse contexts and longer timeframes.

Method: PROBE decomposes proactivity into three capabilities: searching for unspecified issues, identifying bottlenecks, and executing resolutions.

Result: State-of-the-art models like GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1 achieve only 40% end-to-end performance, highlighting limitations.

Conclusion: The study reveals current gaps in autonomous agent systems and points to future research directions.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: WorldTest evaluates model-learning agents by separating reward-free interaction from scored tests in different environments, using AutumnBench's suite of tasks. Humans outperform models, and scaling compute has limited impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for learning and evaluating world models focus narrowly on next-frame prediction and reward maximization, diverging from the goal of supporting diverse downstream tasks.

Method: Proposed WorldTest protocol involves reward-free interaction and a scored test phase in related environments, evaluated on AutumnBench, which includes tasks like masked-frame prediction and planning.

Result: Humans outperformed frontier models on AutumnBench, and scaling compute improved performance inconsistently.

Conclusion: WorldTest offers a novel framework for evaluating world-model learning, revealing significant room for improvement in current models.

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.
