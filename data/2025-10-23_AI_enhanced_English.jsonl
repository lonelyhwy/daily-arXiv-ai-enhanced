However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally\nintensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which\nresults in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action\nrecognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low\ncomputational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone\nnetwork and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)\nstrategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network\n(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer\nefficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated\ninto the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model\ncomplexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to\ncombine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization\nduring training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct\nachieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while\nmaintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across\nall three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition\naccuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing\nrecognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes\nactions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable\nrecognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action\nrecognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "MobiAct is a lightweight MAV action recognition framework using MobileNetV4 and SOKD for efficient motion feature transfer, achieving high accuracy with low computational cost.", "motivation": "Addressing the trade-off between recognition accuracy and speed in MAV motion recognition for resource-limited platforms.", "method": "Uses MobileNetV4 as backbone, Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD), parameter-free attention, and hybrid loss training.", "result": "Achieves 92.12% accuracy, 136.16 pJ energy, and 8.84 actions/second, decoding 2x faster than leading methods.", "conclusion": "MobiAct offers superior efficiency and accuracy for MAV action recognition, suitable for resource-constrained platforms."}}

In this\ncontext, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the\nvast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve\nsingle-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research\nefforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular\ndownstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To\naddress this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of\ngeneralizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for\ninference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative\nlearning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal\nmodel manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We\nevaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and\nregression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the\nmodalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our\nresults demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art\napproaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as\nwell as EO-specific methods.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is.

Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity.
