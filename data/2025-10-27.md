### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapter-based training improves personalized text-to-image synthesis but suffers from spurious correlations. The paper introduces Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training to disentangle target attributes from incidental ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing spurious correlations in adapter-based training for text-to-image synthesis, which hinder generalization and prompt adherence.

Method: Introduces Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training, routing confounding factors through auxiliary modules (e.g., ControlNet or LoRA) during training.

Result: Improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence in tasks like facial and full-body identity injection.

Conclusion: Establishing shortcuts for undesired factors is an effective design principle for disentangled representations in large models.

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) introduces a novel paradigm for semantic-controlled video generation by using a reference video as a prompt, avoiding artifacts and finetuning issues. It achieves strong generalization and sets a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in achieving unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation without artifacts or finetuning dependencies.

Method: VAP employs a Video Diffusion Transformer guided by a Mixture-of-Transformers expert and temporally biased position embedding, supported by VAP-Data.

Result: VAP achieves a 38.7% user preference rate, rivaling commercial models, and demonstrates zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: VAP advances general-purpose, controllable video generation with robustness and versatility.

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-BFF-Net integrates CNNs and transformers with focal modulation and bidirectional feature fusion to improve medical image segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical decisions, but CNNs struggle with global context. Combining CNNs and transformers addresses this limitation.

Method: Proposes FM-BFF-Net, combining convolutional and transformer components with focal modulation attention and bidirectional feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on eight datasets in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient.

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net effectively handles diverse medical imaging scenarios with improved boundary precision and robustness.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT introduces a generative framework for multi-modal point trajectory tracking, outperforming discriminative models in handling occlusions while maintaining accuracy on visible points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative models fail to capture multi-modality in point trajectories due to uncertainty from visual obfuscations like occlusions.

Method: GenPT uses a generative approach with flow matching, iterative refinement, a window-dependent prior, and a tuned variance schedule. It employs best-first search during inference.

Result: GenPT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on occluded points and remains competitive on visible points across benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenPT effectively models multi-modality in point trajectories, improving tracking performance, especially in occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [5] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3DReasonKnee, a first-of-its-kind dataset for grounded reasoning in 3D medical images, specifically knee MRI volumes, to enhance Vision-Language Models' diagnostic alignment with clinicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack the ability to ground anatomical regions in 3D medical images and reason step-by-step, hindering trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration.

Method: Created 3DReasonKnee dataset with 494k quintuples from 7,970 knee MRI volumes, including MRI scans, diagnostic questions, 3D bounding boxes, clinician reasoning steps, and severity assessments.

Result: The dataset was validated with 450+ hours of clinician effort. Benchmarked five VLMs to provide baseline performance on localization and diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee bridges the gap in grounded reasoning datasets, advancing multimodal medical AI towards 3D, clinically aligned decision-making.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for 3D shape reconstruction using thermal polarization cues, independent of illumination/material properties, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current methods reliant on illumination/material properties and ambiguities in visible polarization analyses.

Method: Utilizes long-wave infrared polarimetric imaging and multi-view thermal polarimetric images for detailed 3D shape recovery.

Result: Effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances 3D shape reconstruction by leveraging thermal polarization cues, free from traditional limitations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA introduces self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models using multi-view object-centric videos, improving adaptation without annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing underperformance of foundation models in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning isn't feasible.

Method: Self-supervised fine-tuning via self-distillation, leveraging multi-view object-centric videos and tuning prediction heads for efficient adaptation.

Result: VESSA shows consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks across 3 vision foundation models and 2 datasets.

Conclusion: VESSA effectively adapts vision foundation models to new domains without annotations, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a standardized pipeline for 2D detection of unseen industrial objects, improving detection accuracy under challenging conditions like clutter and poor lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial for robotic manipulation, but current pipelines falter in challenging conditions, making detection a bottleneck.

Method: The approach enhances low-light images and removes backgrounds using open-vocabulary detection with foundation models, reducing domain shift and false positives.

Result: Experiments on industrial benchmarks show significant detection accuracy improvements with minimal inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and practical for industrial applications, enhancing detection reliability for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

### [9] [Deep learning-based automated damage detection in concrete structures using images from earthquake events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21063)
*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based framework using YOLO models to detect and classify structural damage levels in concrete buildings and bridges post-earthquake by identifying exposed steel reinforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely structural integrity assessment post-earthquake is vital for public safety and emergency response, requiring automated methods to detect damage like exposed steel bars.

Method: Utilizes deep learning with fine-tuning and data augmentation, employing YOLOv11 models for damage detection and classification, trained on labeled datasets from the 2023 Turkey Earthquakes.

Result: Developed a hybrid framework for automated damage level determination from images, demonstrating rapid and reliable detection across diverse damage scenarios.

Conclusion: Deep learning approaches enable rapid, automated post-disaster damage assessment, proving effective for varied structural damage contexts.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

### [10] [ZING-3D: Zero-shot Incremental 3D Scene Graphs via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21069)
*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D is a framework leveraging pretrained foundation models for open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation, enabling incremental updates and geometric grounding without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graph methods lack incremental updates, geometric grounding, and are confined to single-view settings, limiting their use in embodied scenarios.

Method: ZING-3D uses VLM reasoning to create a 2D scene graph, grounded in 3D with depth info, capturing objects, features, 3D locations, and semantic relations.

Result: Experiments on Replica and HM3D datasets show ZING-3D effectively captures spatial and relational knowledge without specific training.

Conclusion: ZING-3D provides a robust, incremental, and geometrically grounded solution for 3D scene understanding in robotics.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

### [11] [WaveSeg: Enhancing Segmentation Precision via High-Frequency Prior and Mamba-Driven Spectrum Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21079)
*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg is a novel decoder architecture for semantic segmentation that optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains, using wavelet-domain frequency priors and Mamba-based attention to enhance both semantic context and fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic segmentation networks rely on powerful encoders but use simplistic decoders, resulting in suboptimal balance between semantic context and detail preservation.

Method: WaveSeg introduces wavelet-domain learning, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA), and reparameterized convolutions to refine features and preserve details.

Result: WaveSeg outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Conclusion: WaveSeg's innovative decoder design effectively balances semantic and structural details, setting a new standard for segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

### [12] [Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Model for Plexus Detection in Hirschsprung's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21083)
*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-language model integrating expert-derived textual concepts to improve classification of Hirschsprung's disease regions, outperforming traditional CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models lack interpretability and clinical relevance for Hirschsprung's disease diagnosis.

Method: A framework combining contrastive language-image pre-training with expert-derived prompts encoded by QuiltNet.

Result: Achieved 83.9% accuracy, 86.6% precision, and 87.6% specificity, surpassing CNN models.

Conclusion: Multi-modal learning with expert knowledge enhances histopathology model performance and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HistRetinex, a fast Retinex-based low-light image enhancement method using histogram domain optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retinex methods are effective but slow for large images, prompting a shift from spatial to histogram domain.

Method: Defines histogram matrices, constructs a two-level optimization model, and iteratively solves for illumination and reflectance histograms.

Result: HistRetinex enhances images faster (1.86s vs. 8.53s) while improving visibility and performance metrics.

Conclusion: HistRetinex offers efficient, high-quality low-light enhancement by leveraging histogram domain techniques.

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

*Weijie Zhou,Xuantang Xiong,Yi Peng,Manli Tao,Chaoyang Zhao,Honghui Dong,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Active Visual Reasoning (AVR), extending visual reasoning to interactive environments, and presents CLEVR-AVR and PhysVLM-AVR as benchmarks and solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack the ability to actively gather information in partially observable environments, unlike humans.

Method: AVR involves sequential actions, multi-step observation integration, and dynamic decision-making, evaluated using CLEVR-AVR and trained with AVR-152k dataset.

Result: PhysVLM-AVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks but highlights gaps in current MLLMs' active reasoning.

Conclusion: AVR bridges a critical gap in visual reasoning, showing potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current full-parameter fine-tuning for large-scale models is computationally expensive, and existing methods lack semantic priors, limiting adaptability.

Method: Proposes Controllable-LPMoE, using a dynamic mixed local priors extractor and a bi-directional interaction adapter for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms 31 SOTA methods in segmentation tasks, showing superior adaptability and performance.

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE offers an efficient and effective solution for fine-tuning large models in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

### [16] [SafetyPairs: Isolating Safety Critical Image Features with Counterfactual Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21120)
*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafetyPairs introduces a scalable framework for generating counterfactual image pairs to isolate safety-relevant features, aiding evaluation and training of models for fine-grained image safety distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image safety datasets are coarse and ambiguous, lacking isolation of specific features that determine safety, prompting the need for a systematic approach.

Method: The paper proposes SafetyPairs, a framework using image editing models to create counterfactual pairs where only safety-relevant features are altered, flipping labels while preserving irrelevant details.

Result: SafetyPairs yields a benchmark with 3,020 images across 9 categories, improving model evaluation and sample efficiency for training lightweight guard models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety, enhancing model evaluation and data augmentation strategies.

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO enhances multimodal RL frameworks for Chain-of-Thought reasoning by introducing noise-injected exploration and Bayesian advantage estimation, improving generalization and robustness in small-scale MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL frameworks struggle with generalization beyond training distributions when improving general CoT reasoning in MLLMs.

Method: Introduces NoisyGRPO with noise-injected exploration (Gaussian noise) and Bayesian advantage estimation (Bayesian inference for robust advantage estimation).

Result: Improves generalization and robustness on CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks, especially for small-scale MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO effectively addresses generalization challenges in RL frameworks for CoT reasoning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

### [18] [Digital Contrast CT Pulmonary Angiography Synthesis from Non-contrast CT for Pulmonary Vascular Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21140)
*Ying Ming,Yue Lin,Longfei Zhao,Gengwan Li,Zuopeng Tan,Bing Li,Sheng Xie,Wei Song,Qiqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a CycleGAN-based method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT scans, reducing risks of iodinated contrast agents while achieving superior image quality and performance in downstream tasks like vascular segmentation and quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA, the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases, relies on iodinated contrast agents that pose risks like nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions. The study aims to mitigate these risks by generating DCCTPA from NCCT scans.

Method: A cascaded synthesizer using CycleGAN was trained and validated on 249 paired CTPA and NCCT scans, with an additional 161-paired test set for evaluation. The method was compared to SOTA techniques using quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization.

Result: The proposed DCCTPA outperformed SOTA methods in quantitative metrics (MAE, PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative visualization, showing superior vessel enhancement and structural preservation. Downstream tasks like vessel segmentation and quantification also saw marked improvements over NCCT inputs.

Conclusion: The DCCTPA method effectively enhances vascular details without iodinated contrast, achieving high fidelity and clinical utility, as evidenced by improved segmentation and quantification metrics.

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

*Guanlin Wu,Boyan Su,Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Yichen Lin,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG) to address the challenge of integrating spatial intelligence in foundation models, offering a structured grid-based schema for explicit spatial representation and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods proxy Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) inadequately with textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, lacking geometric fidelity and spatial skill attribution.

Method: Proposes SIG, a grid-based schema encoding object layouts and relations, alongside SIG-informed metrics to quantify spatial capability separately from language priors.

Result: SIG enhances VSI metrics in multimodal LLMs, showing more stable gains than VQA-only methods, and introduces SIGBench, a benchmark for spatial tasks.

Conclusion: SIG proves effective for spatial reasoning in foundation models, with potential applications in data-labeling, training, and autonomous-driving scenarios.

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

*Dogyun Park,Taehoon Lee,Minseok Joo,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BFM partitions the generative trajectory into specialized segments, improving efficiency and sample quality while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Flow Matching models struggle with capturing distinct signal characteristics across timesteps and suffer from high inference costs.

Method: BFM uses smaller, specialized velocity blocks for temporal segments and introduces Semantic Feature Guidance and Feature Residual Approximation.

Result: BFM achieves 2.1x to 4.9x faster inference on ImageNet 256x256 with comparable performance.

Conclusion: BFM offers a more efficient and higher-quality alternative to traditional Flow Matching methods.

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

*Qihang Zhou,Binbin Gao,Guansong Pang,Xin Wang,Jiming Chen,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP improves zero-shot anomaly detection by dynamically aligning visual tokens with customized textual subspaces, avoiding the limitations of single-space alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use a single textual space for aligning visual semantics, which fails to capture varied anomaly semantics accurately.

Method: TokenCLIP introduces token-wise adaptation, aligning each visual token with a unique textual subspace via optimal transport, ensuring fine-grained semantic alignment.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods by enabling dynamic and efficient token-wise alignment, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: TokenCLIP offers a scalable and effective solution for fine-grained anomaly detection by leveraging dynamic subspace alignment.

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution (KBE), a dynamic evaluation framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to address issues like data contamination and saturation in static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static benchmarks for MLLMs are prone to data contamination and saturation, leading to unreliable performance evaluations.

Method: KBE reformulates VQA samples using Graph formulation, integrates multimodal knowledge to expand static benchmarks, and dynamically evolves them by reconstructing questions and adding external textual knowledge.

Result: Experiments show KBE mitigates data contamination and saturation, offering a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: KBE provides a reliable, dynamic evaluation framework for MLLMs, enhancing benchmark quality and controllability.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSSR is a novel method for generating high-quality 3D meshes using Discrete Diffusion Models, enabling parallel generation and outperforming sequential methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve accurate token prediction and parallel generation, surpassing limitations of autoregressive methods.

Method: TSSR uses decoupled training, an improved hourglass architecture with RoPE, and a novel connection loss for topology refinement.

Result: TSSR produces 3D meshes with up to 10,000 faces at a resolution of $1024^3$.

Conclusion: TSSR successfully generates high-quality artist-style meshes efficiently and with high fidelity.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS lacks fine-grained semantics and physical executability for VLN tasks, limiting its practical application.

Method: SAGE-3D introduces Object-Centric Semantic Grounding for object-level annotations and Physics-Aware Execution Jointing for embedding collision objects.

Result: Experiments show improved baseline performance by 31% on VLN-CE Unseen tasks, with strong generalizability.

Conclusion: SAGE-3D successfully upgrades 3DGS for VLN, introducing new datasets and benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineRS is a two-stage MLLM framework for precise small object segmentation in high-resolution images, using coarse-to-fine reasoning and localized refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing MLLMs' limitations in handling high-resolution images and localizing small objects in cluttered scenes.

Method: A two-stage pipeline (Global Semantic Exploration and Localized Perceptual Refinement) with locate-informed retrospective reward.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM methods on segmentation and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: FineRS effectively improves small object localization and segmentation in high-resolution images.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-SAE is a sparse autoencoder that interprets and enhances vision-language alignment by mapping multi-modal representations to a unified concept set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interpretability of vision-language alignment in VLMs is unclear due to the challenge of unifying multi-modal semantics.

Method: VL-SAE uses a distance-based encoder and modality-specific decoders to correlate neurons with concepts, ensuring activation consistency for similar representations.

Result: VL-SAE improves interpretability and alignment performance in tasks like zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.

Conclusion: VL-SAE effectively interprets and enhances vision-language alignment, offering practical benefits for downstream tasks.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

TL;DR: FORM is a machine learning framework predicting 3D cellular structure changes under perturbation, using a morphology encoder and diffusion-based trajectory module, validated by MorphoEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks lack 3D representations, limiting accuracy in modeling cellular responses to perturbations.

Method: FORM uses a morphology encoder (multi-channel VQGAN) and diffusion-based trajectory module trained on 65,000 3D cell volumes.

Result: FORM enables unconditional synthesis, conditional simulation, and predicts downstream signaling and combinatorial effects.

Conclusion: FORM and MorphoEval advance toward accurate 3D virtual cell models by linking morphology, perturbation, and function.

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CT-CLIP, a multi-branch framework combining CNN and Vision Transformer, enhanced by adaptive feature fusion and multimodal learning, achieving high accuracy in apple disease recognition despite complex backgrounds and few-shot conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with phenotypic heterogeneity in apple leaf diseases due to inadequate integration of local and global features.

Method: CT-CLIP integrates CNN for local details and Vision Transformer for global structure, using an Adaptive Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) and multimodal image-text learning with CLIP.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12% on datasets, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP effectively recognizes agricultural diseases, improving accuracy in complex environments and offering a practical solution for automation.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

*Xinyu Zhou,Tongxin Pan,Lingyi Hong,Pinxue Guo,Haijing Guo,Zhaoyu Chen,Kaixun Jiang,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic semantic-aware correlation modeling framework for UAV tracking addresses limitations in semantic exploration and improves accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV tracking methods focus on speed but lack semantic awareness, leading to suboptimal performance under challenges like camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution.

Method: Proposes a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator combined with Transformer correlation maps to explore semantic relevance. A pruning method is also designed to enhance tracking speed.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on UAV tracking datasets, improving accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework provides flexible deployment options with variants balancing speed and accuracy, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

*Anupam Pani,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gaze-regularized framework to enhance VLMs for egocentric tasks like future event prediction and activity understanding, using gaze only during training for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye gaze provides valuable cues for understanding human attention and intent, which can enhance egocentric behavior modeling in VLMs.

Method: Proposes a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that aligns model focus with human gaze, usable during training across various VLM architectures.

Result: Improves prediction scores by up to 11% for future events and 7% for current activity understanding compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates gaze-guided training's effectiveness in boosting VLM accuracy and robustness, applicable in real-world scenarios like assistive robotics.

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

### [33] [Why Registration Quality Matters: Enhancing sCT Synthesis with IMPACT-Based Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21358)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified pipeline for synthetic CT generation from MRI and CBCT using a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder, trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. IMPACT-based registration outperformed mutual-information-based registration locally but showed bias on public validation sets, highlighting registration error propagation in supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT by addressing registration biases and enhancing anatomical fidelity through IMPACT-based registration and a perceptual loss function.

Method: The model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder, trained using AdamW with IMPACT-Synth loss (combining L1 loss and perceptual loss). Inputs were patch-based and augmented with random flipping. Two registration strategies (Elastix and IMPACT) were evaluated.

Result: IMPACT registration achieved more accurate alignments locally, improving sCT synthesis with lower MAE and better anatomical structures. However, Elastix-aligned data performed better on public validation sets due to registration bias.

Conclusion: IMPACT mitigates registration bias, promoting anatomically consistent alignment and more robust sCT synthesis models, though evaluation pipeline biases must be considered.

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

### [34] [BADiff: Bandwidth Adaptive Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21366)
*Xi Zhang,Hanwei Zhu,Yan Zhong,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework adapting diffusion models to adjust image generation quality based on real-time bandwidth constraints, improving efficiency without significant architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models don't account for bandwidth limitations, leading to wasted computation and loss of detail in cloud-to-device scenarios.

Method: Joint end-to-end training conditions the model on target quality levels derived from bandwidth, enabling adaptive denoising.

Result: The approach improves visual fidelity in bandwidth-constrained environments compared to naive early-stopping.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient solution for image delivery under varying bandwidth conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

### [35] [TerraGen: A Unified Multi-Task Layout Generation Framework for Remote Sensing Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21391)
*Datao Tang,Hao Wang,Yudeng Xin,Hui Qiao,Dongsheng Jiang,Yin Li,Zhiheng Yu,Xiangyong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraGen is a unified layout-to-image generation framework for remote sensing tasks, addressing task-isolated limitations by incorporating geographical information and spatial constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative data augmentation frameworks are task-isolated and ignore geographical information and spatial constraints.

Method: Introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder, multi-scale injection scheme, and mask-weighted loss for spatial constraints.

Result: Achieves best generation image quality across tasks and enhances downstream performance.

Conclusion: TerraGen is effective for diverse remote sensing tasks and demonstrates robust cross-task generalization.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

*Zhiying Jiang,Ruhao Yan,Zengxi Zhang,Bowei Zhang,Jinyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method to address ghosting and misalignment caused by parallax, using multi-stage alignment and graph-based seam optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses issues of ghosting and misalignment in image stitching due to significant variations in object depth and parallax.

Method: Combines multi-stage alignment with global depth regularization constraints, uses graph-based computation for optimal seams, and employs a reparameterization strategy for efficiency.

Result: Achieves natural and seamless stitching, outperforming existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates parallax-induced errors and improves efficiency, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

TL;DR: Introduces MUVR, a benchmark for retrieving untrimmed videos using multi-modal queries, featuring practical retrieval paradigms, multi-level visual correspondence, and comprehensive evaluation criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing video retrieval for long-video platforms by addressing the challenges of untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries.

Method: Develops MUVR with features like video-centric multi-modal queries, multi-level visual correspondence, and three evaluation versions (Base, Filter, QA).

Result: Extensive evaluations reveal limitations in current retrieval methods and MLLMs for untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries.

Conclusion: MUVR serves as a valuable benchmark for improving video retrieval and multi-modal understanding, with open-source code available.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable framework for adaptive visual concept learning in real-world scenes, leveraging pretrained vision-language models and universal prompting to identify diverse axes without prior knowledge. It demonstrates superior editing and compositional generalization compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing approaches that rely on predefined axes and synthetic datasets for visual concept learning, aiming to interpret real-world scenes more flexibly.

Method: Uses a pretrained vision-language model and universal prompting to identify concept axes adaptively. Introduces a universal concept encoder and optimizes a compositional anchoring objective for grounding concepts.

Result: Shows effective editing capabilities on ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ datasets, with strong compositional generalization outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully learns and grounds diverse visual concepts adaptively in real-world scenes, offering scalable and superior performance.

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

TL;DR: ArtiLatent is a generative framework for synthesizing 3D objects with detailed geometry, articulation, and realism using latent space modeling and a Gaussian decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create human-made 3D objects with fine geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic appearance, addressing gaps in current methods.

Method: Combines sparse voxel representations and articulation properties in a latent space via a VAE, trains a latent diffusion model, and uses an articulation-aware Gaussian decoder for photorealistic reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on datasets like PartNet-Mobility and ACD, improving geometric consistency and appearance fidelity.

Conclusion: ArtiLatent offers a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation.

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores anisotropic pooling methods to improve table look-up (LUT) CNNs for image restoration, proposing generalized median pooling and adaptive pooling coefficients to outperform traditional average pooling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LUT-based CNN methods rely on average pooling for fusion, which is unsuitable for anisotropic signals. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The authors introduce generalized median pooling and extend it by learning data-dependent pooling coefficients for adaptive fusion of differently oriented pixel patches.

Result: Experiments show the proposed anisotropic pooling strategy achieves better perceptual and numerical results compared to existing LUT-CNN methods.

Conclusion: Anisotropic pooling methods enhance LUT-realizable CNN performance by improving fusion strategies for anisotropic signal structures.

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

TL;DR: OpenHype introduces a continuous hyperbolic latent space to model hierarchical structures in 3D scenes, offering efficient and adaptable 3D scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for modeling hierarchical structures in 3D scenes have limitations like increased inference time or poor generalization. OpenHype addresses these challenges.

Method: OpenHype uses hyperbolic geometry to create a continuous latent space, enabling multi-scale relationships and smooth hierarchy traversal.

Result: OpenHype outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, showcasing efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully improves hierarchical 3D scene modeling with hyperbolic latent spaces.

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Motivation: Learning physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data is challenging, especially for deformable objects.

Method: Constructs a physics-consistent digital twin via constitutive model selection and optimization, generates diverse motion patterns, and trains a GNN-based world model.

Result: Achieves accurate and fast future predictions for deformable objects, with inference speeds 47 times faster than PhysTwin.

Conclusion: PhysWorld offers a scalable solution for learning world models from synthetic data, improving efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoniTor introduces a novel memory-based online scoring queue scheme for training-free Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), leveraging pre-trained large-scale models and LSTM-inspired mechanisms to outperform state-of-the-art methods without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online VAD is underexplored due to real-time constraints, unlike offline VAD, which benefits from recent advancements in LLMs and VLMs. MoniTor addresses this gap by proposing an efficient online solution.

Method: MoniTor uses streaming input for VLMs, incorporates LSTM-inspired prediction mechanisms, and introduces a dynamic scoring queue and anomaly prior to store recent scores and guide anomaly detection.

Result: Evaluated on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and competes with weakly supervised approaches without requiring training.

Conclusion: MoniTor effectively addresses online VAD challenges, demonstrating superior performance and practicality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice, a new video inpainting framework, decouples the task into multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation, leveraging spaced-frame priors and a CoSpliced Module for improved spatiotemporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V-based video inpainting methods struggle with severe content degradation and lack sufficient spatiotemporal stability, especially in later video parts.

Method: VidSplice introduces spaced-frame priors and a CoSpliced Module for spatial coherence, along with a context controller to constrain content distortion during generation.

Result: VidSplice outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive performance in diverse scenarios with improved foreground alignment and motion stability.

Conclusion: The proposed VidSplice framework effectively addresses spatiotemporal stability challenges in video inpainting, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

*Yiming Tang,Wenjia Zhong,Rushi Shah,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC introduces interpretable visual patterns for chest X-ray diagnosis, balancing accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians need transparent, verifiable explanations to trust AI diagnoses, especially in medical imaging.

Method: Uses transcoder-based sparse autoencoders trained on BiomedCLIP to decompose images into interpretable patterns.

Result: Discovered ~5,000 clinically relevant patterns, achieving competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings.

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC demonstrates medical AI can be both accurate and interpretable, supporting safer clinical deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

*Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Lintao Xiang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-stream architecture for integrating cell-level and tissue-level features in histopathological images, improving cancer subtype classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models lack cell-level feature modeling, limiting their performance in fine-grained tasks like cancer subtype classification.

Method: A dual-stream architecture with receptance-weighted key-value aggregation and bidirectional tissue-cell interaction modules is proposed.

Result: The method outperforms existing models on four histopathological subtype classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction are critical for fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAP-MOT is a novel graph-weighted approach for multi-object tracking (MOT) in crowded, overlapping multi-camera views, improving label updates and position estimation for better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses frequent person occlusion in crowded closed-area videos with overlapping camera views, aiming to enhance tracking accuracy.

Method: The method involves feature extraction, tracking, community search, and integrates position estimation, using graph-weighted updates for identification labels.

Result: GRAP-MOT outperforms existing methods on closed-area and real datasets, demonstrating superiority in crowded scenarios.

Conclusion: The study finds IDF1 more suitable than MOTA for MOT comparisons and publicly shares the code and dataset.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how attention heads in text-generative models specialize in semantic or visual attributes, proposing a method to rank and edit heads for targeted concept control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and control the internal mechanisms of language and vision-language models by analyzing attention head specialization.

Method: Reinterprets probing intermediate activations using signal processing, ranking heads by concept relevance, and editing select heads to manipulate outputs.

Result: Demonstrates consistent specialization patterns in attention heads and shows that editing 1% of heads can reliably control targeted concepts.

Conclusion: The study reveals interpretable structures in attention layers, providing tools for understanding and editing large generative models.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses subjective bias and inconsistencies in traditional ultrasound diagnostics for placental abruption by leveraging small-sample learning.

Method: Enhances YOLOv11n with wavelet convolution, coordinate convolution, and cascaded group attention to improve feature extraction and accuracy.

Result: Achieves 78% detection accuracy, outperforming YOLOv11n and YOLOv8, with superior performance in precision-recall and occlusion scenarios.

Conclusion: EH-YOLOv11n offers a reliable, real-time solution for computer-aided placental abruption diagnosis, with high clinical value.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GranViT is a Vision Transformer integrating fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to LLMs, trained on granular annotations from Gran-29M dataset, outperforming existing encoders in fine-grained tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision encoders lack fine-grained perception due to limited annotated data and training paradigms, motivating GranViT's development.

Method: GranViT uses Gran-29M dataset for pretraining, employs bounding-box-to-caption and caption-to-bounding-box regressions, and a self-distillation mechanism for enhanced regional reasoning.

Result: GranViT achieves state-of-the-art results in fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding, surpassing existing encoders.

Conclusion: GranViT's integration of fine-grained features and semantic alignment with LLMs significantly advances vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Foresight Guidance (FSG) to improve conditional guidance in text-to-image diffusion models, outperforming existing methods like CFG in efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to conditional guidance (e.g., CFG) lack a unified theoretical foundation, limiting design choices and efficiency.

Method: The authors reframe conditional guidance as fixed-point iterations and introduce FSG, which solves longer-interval subproblems early with more iterations.

Result: FSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods like CFG in image quality and computational efficiency, validated across diverse datasets and models.

Conclusion: FSG provides a novel perspective for conditional guidance, enabling adaptive design and unlocking further potential in diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control introduces a lightweight method for video-guided Foley by using frozen pretrained models and a small cross-attention bridge, achieving efficient synchronization without retraining the audio model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a lightweight and modular approach for video-guided Foley that retains the strengths of pretrained models while minimizing trainable parameters and preserving controllability.

Method: The method connects video embeddings to a frozen text-to-audio model via a compact cross-attention bridge, pooling video tokens for efficiency.

Result: Results show competitive temporal and semantic alignment with fewer parameters, maintaining modularity and controllability.

Conclusion: Foley Control is effective for video-to-Foley tasks and adaptable to other audio modalities, highlighting its modular and efficient design.

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

TL;DR: Chunk-GRPO improves GRPO for text-to-image generation by optimizing at chunk level and introducing weighted sampling, outperforming step-level methods in quality and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address GRPO's limitations—inaccurate advantage attribution and neglect of temporal dynamics—by shifting optimization to chunk level.

Method: Proposes Chunk-GRPO, grouping steps into chunks for optimization and using optional weighted sampling.

Result: Achieves better preference alignment and image quality compared to step-level GRPO.

Conclusion: Chunk-level optimization shows promise for enhancing GRPO-based T2I generation.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

TL;DR: MATrack is a multiscale adaptive system for nighttime UAV tracking, addressing challenges like low-light conditions and cluttered backgrounds. It outperforms SOTA methods in precision and speed, validated in real-world UAV applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nighttime UAV tracking faces challenges like low-light conditions and cluttered backgrounds, causing trackers to fail. Existing solutions have limitations like visual artifacts and high computational costs.

Method: MATrack uses three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) for feature consistency, Adaptive Key Token Gate for object identification, and Nighttime Template Calibrator (NTC) for stable tracking.

Result: MATrack improves precision, normalized precision, and AUC by 5.9%, 5.4%, and 4.2% respectively on UAVDark135, achieving 81 FPS. Real-world tests confirm its reliability.

Conclusion: MATrack effectively addresses nighttime UAV tracking challenges, outperforming existing methods while maintaining real-time performance and reliability for critical applications.

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER is a two-stage super-resolution framework prioritizing text fidelity and guided image enhancement, breaking the trade-off between image quality and text readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative super-resolution methods compromise text readability for image quality, necessitating a solution that balances both.

Method: TIGER employs a "text-first, image-later" paradigm, decoupling glyph restoration and image enhancement, using reconstructed text to guide full-image super-resolution.

Result: TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving text readability without sacrificing overall image quality, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: TIGER effectively balances text and image enhancement, setting a new benchmark for super-resolution tasks involving text.

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (ANN and CNN) outperform state-of-the-art methods for detecting epileptic spikes in MEG recordings, even with limited annotations. Interactive machine learning improves annotation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual detection of epileptic spikes in MEG is error-prone; automated methods lack clinical suitability due to annotation demands or robustness issues.

Method: Proposed ANN and CNN architectures trained on 59 patients' data; interactive machine learning refined annotations. Evaluated on 10 holdout patients.

Result: Both models outperformed existing methods (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44); interactive learning improved annotation robustness.

Conclusion: Simple architectures work well despite imperfect data. Interactive machine learning speeds annotation; models are efficient for clinical spike detection.

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

TL;DR: The paper proposes S3OD, a synthetic dataset method using multi-modal diffusion and DINO-v3 features to improve salient object detection generalization, reducing errors by 20-50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the high cost of pixel-precise annotations and the need for separate model training in subtasks like DIS and HR-SOD by leveraging synthetic data.

Method: Uses a multi-modal diffusion pipeline to generate over 139,000 high-resolution images, prioritizes challenging categories iteratively, and employs an ambiguity-aware multi-mask decoder.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data show significant error reduction (20-50%) in cross-dataset generalization, with fine-tuned versions achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Large-scale synthetic data and ambiguity-aware architecture effectively enhance generalization and performance in salient object detection tasks.

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modest-Align is a lightweight cross-modal alignment framework designed for low-resource settings, improving robustness by reducing overconfidence with Random Perturbation and Embedding Smoothing. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly less data and resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale models like CLIP struggle with overconfidence and degraded performance in resource-constrained settings due to ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text pairs.

Method: Modest-Align uses Random Perturbation (introduces controlled noise) and Embedding Smoothing (calibrates similarity distributions) to mitigate overconfidence and improve alignment.

Result: Modest-Align achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods in retrieval tasks, requiring 100x less training data and 600x less GPU time than CLIP.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable solution for cross-modal alignment in low-resource scenarios, balancing efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

*Orest Kupyn,Fabian Manhardt,Federico Tombari,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance video generation models by integrating epipolar geometry constraints, addressing geometric inconsistencies and unstable motion without sacrificing visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with geometric inconsistencies and unstable motion, which undermine realism. Addressing these issues could benefit various generation and reconstruction applications.

Method: The authors align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry constraints via preference-based optimization, enforcing geometric principles without requiring end-to-end differentiability.

Result: Evaluation shows that geometric constraints provide stable optimization signals, outperforming learned metrics. The model generalizes well from static scenes with dynamic cameras to diverse dynamic content.

Conclusion: Combining classical geometric computer vision with data-driven deep learning yields spatially consistent video generation without compromising visual quality.

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

### [60] [DAP-MAE: Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder for Effective Cross-Domain Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21635)
*Ziqi Gao,Qiufu Li,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAP-MAE is proposed to address limited point cloud data by adaptively integrating cross-domain knowledge for general point cloud analysis, achieving high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud data scarcity across domains and misalignment of prior knowledge with downstream tasks motivated the development of DAP-MAE.

Method: DAP-MAE uses a heterogeneous domain adapter with adaptation and fusion modes, along with a domain feature generator, to integrate knowledge from cross-domain datasets.

Result: DAP-MAE achieves 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Conclusion: DAP-MAE effectively leverages cross-domain point cloud data for pre-training, improving performance across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

*Han Yang,Guangjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gompertz-CNN proposes a dynamic knowledge distillation framework using the Gompertz growth model to optimize student learning progression, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation fails to adapt to the evolving cognitive capacity of student models, leading to inefficient knowledge transfer.

Method: Uses a Gompertz curve-based stage-aware distillation strategy, Wasserstein distance for feature discrepancies, and gradient matching for alignment.

Result: Achieves up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: The Gompertz-CNN framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional distillation, improving accuracy dynamically.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Group Inertial Poser, a method combining IMU and UWB technology for accurate multi-human motion tracking, outperforming existing methods and releasing a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of IMU-based motion tracking (lack of spatial reference) and occlusion issues in vision-based methods by leveraging UWB distances for robust pose estimation.

Method: Uses IMU data fused with UWB-ranging distances in structured state-space models, employing a two-step optimization for global trajectory tracking. Introduces GIP-DB dataset.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of IMU+UWB fusion for multi-human motion capture in uncontrolled environments.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [63] [Long-tailed Species Recognition in the NACTI Wildlife Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21657)
*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a study on Long-Tail Recognition (LTR) methodologies for species recognition in the NACTI dataset, achieving significant accuracy improvements over baselines and demonstrating stronger generalization under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the severe class imbalance in real-world datasets like NACTI, where 'Head' classes dominate. Addressing this imbalance is crucial for accurate species recognition.

Method: The authors experiment with various LTR loss functions and regularization techniques on the NACTI dataset, using the PyTorch Wildlife model. They also evaluate domain shifts using a Reduced-Bias Test set from ENA-Detection.

Result: The best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1 accuracy on NACTI, outperforming baseline models. It also shows improved generalization (52.55% accuracy) on domain-shifted data.

Conclusion: LTR-enhancing methods yield consistent improvements in wildlife recognition tasks, though they struggle with severe domain shifts for 'Tail' classes. The authors emphasize reproducibility by sharing datasets and code.

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

### [64] [Self-Supervised Learning of Synapse Types from EM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21663)
*Aarav Shetty,Gary B Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised method to classify synapses in EM images based on similarity among nearby synapses within the same neuron, avoiding the need for predefined classes or ground-truth examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of supervised classification methods, which require labeled examples and predefined synapse types, by leveraging the natural similarity of synapses within the same neuron.

Method: The method clusters synapses unsupervisedly by assuming nearby synapses in the same neuron are more similar than randomly selected synapses from different neurons. It was tested on Drosophila data.

Result: The approach successfully identifies synapse classes without prior knowledge of their types and offers a principled way to define ground-truth synapse structures.

Conclusion: The unsupervised method provides a flexible and principled alternative to traditional supervised synapse classification, with potential applications in biology.

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

*Riya Gupta,Yiwei Zong,Dennis H. Murphree*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundation models UNI and Virchow2 for classifying whole-slide images (WSIs) into three dermatopathological categories, with Virchow2 performing slightly better. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated slide-level, and logistic regression achieved the highest accuracy (90%). Data augmentation and normalization were explored to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for automated methods to process and classify WSIs efficiently due to their rapid generation in dermatopathology.

Method: Used UNI and Virchow2 as feature extractors, aggregated patch-level embeddings into slide-level features via mean-aggregation, and trained classifiers (logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, random forest). Performance metrics included precision, recall, and AUROC.

Result: Virchow2 outperformed UNI, with logistic regression achieving 90% accuracy (non-significant difference). Mean-aggregation provided reliable slide-level features.

Conclusion: Foundation models like Virchow2 offer scalable and effective solutions for WSI classification, with potential for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

*Sikuang Li,Chen Yang,Jiemin Fang,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow is a hierarchical framework for generating infinitely extendable 3D scenes, leveraging pre-trained 3D models and featuring data curation, block inpainting, and coarse-to-fine generation. It outperforms existing methods in geometry reconstruction and supports photorealistic infinite scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in creating large, continuous 3D environments with consistent geometry and realistic appearance, overcoming limitations of 2D-lifting methods, scalability of 3D implicit representations, and object-centric 3D foundation models.

Method: WorldGrow uses a hierarchical framework with three core components: data curation for high-quality scene blocks, 3D block inpainting for context-aware extension, and coarse-to-fine generation for plausible global layouts and detailed local fidelity.

Result: Evaluated on 3D-FRONT, WorldGrow achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction and uniquely supports infinite, photorealistic scene generation with structural consistency.

Conclusion: WorldGrow demonstrates potential for constructing large-scale virtual environments and advancing future world models, addressing key challenges in 3D scene synthesis.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses trust issues in black-box neural-network models for ecological monitoring by using post-hoc explanations to validate predictions and identify limitations, demonstrating effectiveness with aerial imagery of pinnipeds in Glacier Bay National Park.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build trust in computer vision for ecological research by providing transparent explanations for model predictions and uncovering limitations for field deployment.

Method: Applied Faster R-CNN for detecting pinnipeds, using HiResCAM, LayerCAM, LIME, and perturbation-based explanations to assess localization fidelity, faithfulness, and diagnostic utility.

Result: Explanations focused on seal features rather than background, validated true positives, and identified errors like seal confusion with black ice and rocks.

Conclusion: Post-hoc explainability transforms black-box models into auditable tools for conservation, with actionable steps for improving data curation and augmentation.

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

*Han Yan,Xibin Song,Yifu Wang,Hongdong Li,Pan Ji,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BachVid is a training-free method for generating consistent videos using DiTs' attention mechanism and intermediate features, eliminating the need for reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for consistent video generation rely on reference images or extensive training, often addressing only character consistency, leaving backgrounds inconsistent.

Method: Analyzes DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features to extract foreground masks and matching points, caches variables from an identity video, and injects them into new videos.

Result: BachVid achieves robust foreground and background consistency in generated videos without additional training or reference images.

Conclusion: BachVid provides an efficient, training-free solution for consistent video generation, leveraging DiTs' inherent capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

*Nir Goren,Shai Yehezkel,Omer Dahary,Andrey Voynov,Or Patashnik,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual diffusion models solve geometric problems by transforming Gaussian noise into images representing approximate solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that visual diffusion models can reason about geometric problems directly in pixel space, bypassing the need for specialized architectures.

Method: Treats geometric problems as images, trains a visual diffusion model to transform noise into valid solution images.

Result: Successfully applied to the Inscribed Square Problem, Steiner Tree Problem, and Simple Polygon Problem, showing accurate approximations.

Conclusion: Operating in image space offers a general framework for solving hard geometric problems, bridging generative modeling and geometric reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated framework detects visual attribute dependencies in vision models using iterative self-reflection and hypothesis testing, improving performance over non-reflective baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure model robustness, prevent overfitting, and avoid spurious correlations by identifying unintended reliance on specific visual features.

Method: A self-reflective agent systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes, iteratively refining them based on experimental outcomes and self-evaluation.

Result: The agent's performance improves with self-reflection, outperforming non-reflective baselines. It identifies dependencies in models like CLIP's vision encoder and YOLOv8.

Conclusion: Self-reflection enhances the detection of visual attribute dependencies, aiding in understanding and improving model behavior.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks LM agents' rational decision-making in strategic tasks, identifies gaps compared to humans, and introduces Bayesian-inspired methods to improve performance, achieving significant gains in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate and enhance the rational decision-making of LM agents in high-stakes, information-seeking scenarios, inspired by human behavior.

Method: Developed Collaborative Battleship task, compared LM agents to humans, and introduced Monte Carlo inference strategies based on Bayesian Experimental Design to improve LM performance.

Result: LM agents initially struggled but achieved substantial improvements: Spotter accuracy increased by 14.7%, Captain EIG by 0.227 bits, and win rates surged (e.g., 8% to 82% against humans).

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian methods significantly enhance LM agents' rationality and efficiency, demonstrating broad applicability in strategic decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Standard instruct LMs can match or surpass reasoning models (RMs) using CodeAdapt, a method combining CodeAct and few-shot learning, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that standard instruct LMs can perform comparably or better than RMs without costly fine-tuning, using simpler and more efficient methods.

Method: CodeAdapt combines the CodeAct framework (interleaving natural language reasoning with code execution) and few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from minimal training data.

Result: CodeAdapt enables three LMs to outperform corresponding RMs on average across eight tasks (up to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and excels on six tasks (up to 35.7%).

Conclusion: CodeAdapt-style learning is domain-general and efficient, and code-enabled LMs are powerful, suggesting a strong foundation for reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FICSIM dataset introduces long-form fiction similarity scores, revealing embedding models' focus on surface features over semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of suitable datasets for evaluating language models in computational literary studies due to coarse-grained similarity focus and short texts.

Method: Authors assembled FICSIM, a dataset of long-form fiction with similarity scores, validated by digital humanities scholars, and evaluated embedding models.

Result: Embedding models prioritized surface-level features over semantic categories relevant to literary studies.

Conclusion: FICSIM provides a valuable resource for literary studies, highlighting the need for models capturing deeper semantic similarities.

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,

### [74] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to understand long legal documents by testing their performance on identifying overruling relationships in Supreme Court cases, revealing biases and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' legal reasoning abilities, especially for long-context tasks.

Method: Uses a dataset of 236 U.S. Supreme Court case pairs to assess state-of-the-art LLMs on identifying overruling relationships.

Result: Highlights three key limitations: era sensitivity, shallow reasoning, and context-dependent reasoning failures.

Conclusion: Provides a benchmark that better reflects real-world legal complexity and identifies critical gaps in LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

*Josh McGiff,Khanh-Tung Tran,William Mulcahy,Dáibhidh Ó Luinín,Jake Dalzell,Róisín Ní Bhroin,Adam Burke,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Irish-BLiMP is the first dataset for evaluating Irish language competence in LLMs and humans, revealing human superiority and gaps between model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a systematic framework for evaluating linguistic competence in Irish, an endangered language, and assess LLMs.

Method: Manually constructed 1020 minimal pairs across 11 linguistic features, reviewed by fluent Irish speakers, and tested LLMs and human participants.

Result: Humans outperformed LLMs by 16.6% on average, with a 18.1% gap between open- and closed-source models.

Conclusion: Irish-BLiMP offers a benchmark for advancing LLM research in low-resource languages, showing differences in human and model learning.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [76] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Confidence-gated CoT prompts reasoning only when direct answers lack confidence, reducing unnecessary token usage while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the use of Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting by determining when it's beneficial, avoiding redundant reasoning.

Method: Evaluated four training-free confidence estimation methods for gating CoT, comparing them to random baselines and an oracle.

Result: Existing confidence measures reduce redundant CoT but vary in effectiveness across datasets and models.

Conclusion: Confidence-gated CoT shows promise but requires further refinement for reliable adaptive gating.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

### [77] [Reasoning's Razor: Reasoning Improves Accuracy but Can Hurt Recall at Critical Operating Points in Safety and Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21049)
*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning aids LLMs in average accuracy but struggles with precision-sensitive tasks under low false positive rates (FPR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate reasoning's effectiveness in precision-sensitive classification tasks, particularly under low-FPR regimes.

Method: Analyzed safety and hallucination detection tasks using fine-tuned and zero-shot LLMs/LRMs, comparing reasoning-augmented (Think On) and no-reasoning (Think Off) approaches.

Result: Think On improves overall accuracy but fails at low-FPR thresholds; Think Off excels in precision-sensitive settings. Token-based scoring outperforms self-verbalized confidence.

Conclusion: Reasoning is a double-edged tool: boosts average accuracy but often unsuitable for strict precision needs. Ensembles can combine strengths.

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE is a lightweight framework for dynamic demonstration selection in in-context knowledge editing, improving edit success and reducing latency without modifying LLM weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issues of static demonstration sets in in-context knowledge editing, which lead to a quantity-quality trade-off and lack of adaptivity to task difficulty.

Method: Trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank demonstrations by editing reward and uses a learnable threshold to dynamically adjust the demonstration set length.

Result: On COUNTERFACT benchmark, DR-IKE improves edit success by up to 17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and maintains accuracy on unrelated queries.

Conclusion: DR-IKE offers a scalable and adaptive solution for knowledge editing in black-box LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

*William Christian,Daniel Adamlu,Adrian Yu,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Adaptive RAG system for Indonesian QA, addressing language gaps by using a complexity classifier and machine translation for data augmentation, revealing both success in classification and challenges in retrieval strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in QA systems' performance for low-resource languages like Indonesian, leveraging Adaptive RAG and data augmentation methods.

Method: Uses a classifier to determine question complexity and employs machine translation for dataset expansion, integrating Adaptive RAG for Indonesian QA.

Result: Reliable complexity classification achieved, but multi-retrieval answering strategies showed inconsistencies, impacting overall evaluation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates promise for low-resource language QA but highlights retrieval strategy challenges, suggesting future improvements.

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CDrugRed is the first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset for metabolic diseases, tested with LLMs, showing room for improvement despite supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of publicly available EHR datasets, especially non-English ones, for advancing drug recommendation systems.

Method: Development of CDrugRed, a dataset with 5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, benchmarked using state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Best model achieved an F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard score of 0.4477, indicating task complexity.

Conclusion: CDrugRed is a valuable, challenging resource for improving drug recommendation systems.

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Rewarding PPO improves generalization and data efficiency in fine-tuning LLMs by combining SFT and PPO with a novel reward mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of SFT like overfitting and poor generalization by introducing an on-policy fine-tuning method.

Method: Integrates SFT and PPO using a reward function based on the log policy ratio between SFT and pretrained models.

Result: Outperforms traditional SFT methods in NLP tasks, especially with limited high-quality data.

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO effectively aligns LLMs using demonstration data, enhancing generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

### [82] [The Gray Zone of Faithfulness: Taming Ambiguity in Unfaithfulness Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21118)
*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new faithfulness annotation framework, VeriGray, to address ambiguity in LLM summaries by classifying cases requiring external knowledge, revealing LLMs still struggle with faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing annotation ambiguity in LLM faithfulness benchmarks due to unclear boundaries of permissible external knowledge.

Method: Introduces an intermediate category (Out-Dependent) for cases needing external verification and builds VeriGray benchmark.

Result: SOTA LLMs like GPT-5 show hallucinations (~6%) and many sentences (~8%) fall into Out-Dependent, highlighting annotation challenges.

Conclusion: VeriGray exposes significant gaps in current faithfulness detection, indicating room for improvement in benchmarks and methods.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), proposing a taxonomy and discussing orchestration strategies, empirical insights, applications, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the complementary strengths of LLMs (semantic depth) and TAGs (structured reasoning) to enhance representation learning and reasoning interpretability.

Method: The paper introduces a taxonomy for LLM-TAG integration, categorizing orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module frameworks, and discusses TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and fine-tuning techniques.

Result: The survey summarizes empirical insights, available datasets, and applications in recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and question answering.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the potential of LLM-TAG integration, outlines open challenges, and aims to guide future research at the intersection of language and graph learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

*Ning Bian,Xianpei Han,Hongyu Lin,Baolei Wu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs simulate human behavior in social contexts but often reflect idealized versions due to biases like social desirability, role bias, and positivity, leading to oversimplified "Utopian" societies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how accurately LLMs emulate human behavior in social simulations, given their increasing use in social science studies.

Method: A systematic framework simulating multi-agent interactions in chatroom-style conversations, analyzed across five linguistic dimensions to examine cognitive biases.

Result: LLMs exhibit biases (social role, primacy, positivity) and produce idealized behavior, diverging from real human complexity and variability.

Conclusion: LLMs need better social grounding to capture authentic human diversity in behavior.

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited benchmarks exist for evaluating LLMs in Estonian, motivating the creation of a comprehensive benchmark to assess performance on diverse tasks.

Method: The benchmark uses seven datasets from native Estonian sources, evaluating general and domain-specific knowledge, grammar, summarization, and contextual comprehension. Performance of base models, instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models is compared.

Result: Human evaluations showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark results. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, as an LLM judge, aligned strongly with human ratings.

Conclusion: Top-performing LLMs like Claude 3.7 Sonnet can effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models, demonstrating their utility in benchmarking.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover how extremist ideologies spread on social media and influence politics.

Method: Uses NLP techniques and sociological insights on a corpus of English and French far-right tweets (MIGR-TWIT).

Result: Identifies discourse patterns around migration and hate speech, revealing persuasive techniques used by far-right actors.

Conclusion: Combining linguistic, sociological, and computational methods provides cross-disciplinary insights into right-wing extremism's societal impact.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the

far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency medical dispatch faces challenges like caller distress and cognitive load. LLMs and MAS can augment dispatchers by simulating realistic scenarios.

Method: Developed a clinical taxonomy and call protocol, then created an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents grounded in a fact commons. Evaluated using physician assessments and automated linguistic analysis.

Result: High performance in Dispatch Effectiveness (94%) and Guidance Efficacy (91%). Algorithmic metrics showed neutral sentiment (73.7%), high readability (Flesch 80.9), and polite style (60%).

Conclusion: The MAS simulates diverse, plausible scenarios with high fidelity, supporting its use for training, protocol evaluation, and real-time decision support.

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

### [88] [Correlation Dimension of Auto-Regressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21258)
*Xin Du,Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure, to evaluate the structural complexity of text generated by large language models (LLMs), addressing limitations of traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for LLMs focus on local prediction accuracy but fail to capture long-range structural complexity, leading to puzzling behaviors like repetition and incoherence despite low perplexity.

Method: The authors propose using correlation dimension to quantify the epistemological complexity of text. This measure assesses self-similarity and hierarchical recurrence structure, providing a unified framework for local and global properties.

Result: Experiments show correlation dimension identifies three pretraining phases, reflects context-dependent complexity, indicates hallucination tendencies, and detects degeneration in generated text. The method is efficient, robust, and applicable across autoregressive architectures.

Conclusion: Correlation dimension offers a novel, computationally efficient tool to better understand LLM generative dynamics, overcoming limitations of conventional evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn) to optimize LLM prefilling by increasing block-level sparsity, achieving faster computation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling LLM context length is computationally expensive due to the O(N²) complexity of self-attention. Block-sparse attention helps but can be sub-optimal due to scattered important tokens.

Method: Introduces PBS-Attn, leveraging attention permutation properties to enhance block-level sparsity, paired with custom kernels for efficient computation.

Result: PBS-Attn outperforms existing block-sparse methods in accuracy and matches full attention, achieving a 2.75× speedup in prefilling.

Conclusion: PBS-Attn is a practical solution for efficient LLM prefilling, balancing speed and accuracy in long-context tasks.

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

*Yarik Menchaca Resendiz,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL uses LLMs as RL agents via prompting, achieving competitive performance in simple environments but struggling with complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' potential as RL agents in non-linguistic tasks, beyond traditional supervised or unsupervised settings.

Method: PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in prompts, enabling trial-and-error learning without fine-tuning.

Result: PARL matches or outperforms traditional RL agents in simple environments but falters in tasks needing complex math or state-action decoding.

Conclusion: LLMs can function as effective RL agents in simpler environments, but their performance is limited in more complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A diversity-steered sampler improves uncertainty estimation in LLMs for QA by reducing semantic redundancy and enhancing sample efficiency without requiring gradient access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating uncertainties in LLMs for free-form QA is costly due to the need for many expensive generations.

Method: The paper introduces a diversity-steered sampler using an NLI model to penalize semantic redundancy during decoding, covering autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms. Importance reweighting and control variates are used for debiasing and variance reduction.

Result: The method matches or surpasses baselines on four QA benchmarks, covering more semantic clusters with the same sample count.

Conclusion: The modular framework enhances uncertainty estimation in LLMs without gradient access, making it suitable for risk-sensitive deployments.

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [92] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why NLP models remain robust to scrambled letters (typoglycemia), hypothesizing that few English words collapse into identical forms and context helps disambiguation. Experiments with BERT confirm minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness of NLP models to letter scrambling (typoglycemia) and whether context aids disambiguation.

Method: Analyzed the British National Corpus for word collapse, evaluated BERT's disambiguation, and compared BERT trained on clean vs. scrambled text.

Result: Performance drop due to scrambling was smaller than expected, suggesting context resolves ambiguity.

Conclusion: Few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and context effectively disambiguates them.

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide is a benchmark evaluating LLMs' ability to revise travel itineraries under disruptions, assessing metrics like Preservation of Intent, Responsiveness, and Adaptability. It combines automatic, LLM-as-a-judge, and expert evaluations. Results show strong sequential consistency but declining disruption-handling with longer plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools lack evaluation of LLMs' adaptability to travel disruptions like cancellations or closures. TripTide addresses this gap by modeling disruptions and assessing revision quality.

Method: TripTide evaluates LLMs using automatic metrics (Preservation of Intent, Responsiveness, Adaptability), LLM-as-a-judge scoring, and manual expert review for semantic, spatial, and sequential consistency.

Result: LLMs maintain semantic and sequential stability but show spatial deviations in shorter trips. Disruption-handling declines with longer plans, revealing robustness limits.

Conclusion: TripTide benchmarks LLM adaptability in travel planning, highlighting strengths in consistency but weaknesses in handling disruptions for extended itineraries.

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Single-turn training for LLMs generalizes well to multi-turn evaluations, while multi-turn training degrades single-turn reasoning performance, suggesting single-turn training is more effective for tasks with complete information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for reasoning tasks, given the potential mismatch between single-turn training and real-world multi-turn interactions.

Method: Comparison of conventional single-turn training with three multi-turn strategies for reasoning tasks.

Result: Single-turn trained models generalize well to both single- and multi-turn evaluations, whereas multi-turn trained models show significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance.

Conclusion: For tasks with complete information, robust single-turn training is more effective and reliable than multi-turn training with basic feedback.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

### [95] [A Diagnostic Benchmark for Sweden-Related Factual Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21360)
*Jenny Kunz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new Swedish-focused QA benchmark tests local knowledge retention and model adaptability, showing smaller models with Swedish coverage can match larger multilingual ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are US-centric and lack relevance to Sweden-specific knowledge, prompting the creation of a localized dataset.

Method: Manually written QA benchmark inspired by Swedish culture, media personalities, and sports events, with English translations for cross-lingual analysis.

Result: Smaller models with Swedish coverage perform like larger multilingual ones; Swedish pre-training improves recall but causes partial forgetting.

Conclusion: The dataset effectively studies language adaptation and knowledge retention in multilingual models.

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

*Raphael Scheible-Schmitt,Stefan Schweter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SindBERT is the first large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish, trained on 312 GB of text. It performs competitively but shows no consistent scaling advantage, highlighting the importance of corpus quality over size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of morphologically rich languages like Turkish in NLP by developing SindBERT, a large-scale encoder model.

Method: Trained SindBERT from scratch using 312 GB of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia) in base and large configurations, evaluating it on tasks like POS tagging and offensive language detection.

Result: SindBERT performs competitively with existing models but lacks consistent scaling benefits, suggesting benchmark saturation and emphasizing corpus quality's importance.

Conclusion: SindBERT provides a valuable resource for Turkish NLP and insights into scaling limits and corpus composition's role in morphologically rich languages.

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of a large-scale Hebrew RoBERTa encoder and limitations of existing Hebrew models like HeBERT and AlephBERT.

Method: Training HalleluBERT (base and large) from scratch on 49.1GB Hebrew text with a Hebrew-specific BPE vocabulary.

Result: HalleluBERT outperforms monolingual and multilingual baselines in NER and sentiment classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: HalleluBERT demonstrates the advantages of fully converged monolingual pretraining for Hebrew NLP tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such
as HeBERT, AlephBERT, and HeRo are limited by corpus size, vocabulary, or
training depth. We present HalleluBERT, a RoBERTa-based encoder family (base
and large) trained from scratch on 49.1~GB of deduplicated Hebrew web text and
Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual
pretraining.

TL;DR: The paper explores Vision Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare, focusing on human activity recognition (HAR), introducing a descriptive caption dataset and evaluation methods to assess VLMs' performance compared to traditional deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored use of VLMs in HAR for remote health monitoring, leveraging their flexibility and potential to outperform traditional models.

Method: The authors introduce a descriptive caption dataset and propose comprehensive evaluation methods for VLMs in HAR, conducting comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Result: VLMs achieve comparable or superior performance in HAR compared to traditional deep learning models, demonstrating their potential in intelligent healthcare systems.

Conclusion: This work establishes a benchmark for VLMs in HAR and highlights their promising role in advancing healthcare applications.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces UDCG, a new metric for evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, addressing misalignments in traditional IR metrics by considering both positive contributions of relevant documents and negative impacts of distracting ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IR metrics fail to align with RAG systems due to differences in how humans and LLMs process retrieved documents and the impact of irrelevant documents on generation quality.

Method: The authors propose a utility-based annotation schema and UDCG, a metric incorporating LLM-oriented positional discounting and distraction awareness.

Result: Experiments show UDCG improves correlation with answer accuracy by up to 36% over traditional metrics across five datasets and six LLMs.

Conclusion: UDCG offers a more reliable evaluation framework for RAG systems, aligning IR metrics with LLM consumers' needs.

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for remote patient monitoring highlights gaps in human-machine interaction, motivating the development of REMONI to enhance healthcare efficiency and reduce costs.

Method: REMONI combines multimodal large language models, IoT, and wearables to collect and process vital signs, accelerometer data, and video clips. It uses anomaly detection (e.g., fall detection) and NLP for activity and emotion recognition, integrating data via prompt engineering.

Result: The system enables real-time monitoring and interaction through a web app, showing scalability and potential to reduce medical workloads and costs in practical settings.

Conclusion: REMONI's prototype demonstrates robust capabilities, promising a scalable solution for remote patient monitoring with improved caregiver interaction.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) to enhance token correlation in diffusion language models (DLMs), improving reasoning performance and sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs lag behind LLMs in reasoning due to independent token generation, which misses token correlation. The study aims to address this gap.

Method: Defines intra- and inter-sequence token correlation and introduces MRO with test-time scaling, reject sampling, reinforcement learning, and strategies like group step and importance sampling.

Result: MRO improves reasoning performance and achieves faster sampling while maintaining high benchmark scores.

Conclusion: Enhancing token correlation via MRO effectively bridges the reasoning gap between DLMs and LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: A scalable method fine-tunes pretrained language models to predict fMRI responses across multiple participants, improving brain alignment and semantic task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning language models with brain responses are limited by participant-specific data, hindering generalization and population-level analysis.

Method: Fine-tuned pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses from multiple participants.

Result: Achieved stronger brain alignment, reduced fMRI data needs by 5x, increased alignment by 50%, and improved semantic task performance.

Conclusion: The method bridges neuroscience and AI, showing bidirectional benefits and offering generalizable semantic representations.

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for detecting hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by disentangling contributions of external context and parametric knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in RAG outputs by understanding the mechanisms behind hallucinations.

Method: Uses Qwen3-0.6b to compute external context and parametric knowledge scores, training regression-based classifiers for hallucination detection.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness against state-of-the-art models and baselines, with classifiers generalizing to GPT-4.1-mini.

Conclusion: Mechanistic signals are efficient and generalizable predictors for hallucination detection in RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Motivation: The authors aim to leverage category theory to extract and analyze document structure, enabling advanced information processing and model enhancement techniques.

Method: They represent documents as categories of question-answer pairs, orthogonalize information, and develop measures and summarization techniques. They also propose a self-supervised method using RLVR for model improvement.

Result: The framework yields new summarization techniques, document extension solutions, and improved pretrained models through consistency constraints.

Conclusion: The category theoretic approach successfully enables advanced document analysis and model enhancement, offering novel solutions for multimodal information processing.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

### [105] [Are the LLMs Capable of Maintaining at Least the Language Genus?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21561)
*Sandra Mitrović,David Kletz,Ljiljana Dolamic,Fabio Rinaldi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how genealogical language structure influences LLMs' multilingual behavior, finding genus-level effects dependent on training data and noting distinct strategies across LLM families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs are sensitive to linguistic genera and how training data impacts their multilingual performance.

Method: Extends prior analyses on MultiQ dataset, testing LLM preferences for switching to related languages and knowledge consistency within genera.

Result: Genus-level effects exist but are heavily influenced by training resource availability, with distinct multilingual strategies observed across LLM families.

Conclusion: LLMs encode genus-level linguistic structure, but training data imbalances are the main driver of multilingual performance variations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

*Mojca Brglez,Špela Vintar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SloPragEval and SloPragMega, pragmatics benchmarks for Slovene, highlighting gaps in LLMs' understanding of nuanced and culture-specific language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs advance, there's a need for more challenging evaluations beyond surface-level linguistic competence, focusing on pragmatics—understanding situational meaning shaped by context and cultural norms.

Method: The authors introduce benchmarks with 405 multiple-choice questions, discuss translation challenges, establish a human baseline, and evaluate LLMs.

Result: Current LLMs show improved nuanced language understanding but struggle with implied speaker meaning in culture-specific contexts. Proprietary models outperform open-source ones.

Conclusion: Benchmarks for nuanced language and cultural understanding should be native-designed and human-validated.

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection methods are used to identify phonotactic inconsistencies in Kokborok-Bangla wordlists, flagging potential errors and borrowings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lexical data collection often has transcription errors and borrowings that can mislead linguistic analysis.

Method: Character-level and syllable-level phonotactic features are applied to detect anomalies.

Result: Syllable-aware methods outperform character-level baselines, though precision and recall are modest.

Conclusion: The approach helps fieldworkers systematically flag entries for verification, improving data quality.

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' underperformance in stock movement prediction, attributing it to reliance on analysts' opinions and lack of systematic reasoning. It introduces RETuning to enhance reasoning and prediction, validated by a large dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' limitations in financial tasks, particularly stock movement prediction, which lacks systematic reasoning and independent analysis despite their success in other domains.

Method: Proposes Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start method encouraging dynamic evidence organization and scoring for independent reasoning before reinforcement learning.

Result: RETuning improves LLMs' reasoning in finance, with scalable performance even months later or on out-of-distribution stocks, leveraging a comprehensive dataset.

Conclusion: RETuning effectively enhances LLMs' financial reasoning, reducing context bias and improving prediction reliability.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning dynamics, despite existing models focusing on outputs or individual aspects.

Method: Proposes Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track) using LLMs as probabilistic encoders to measure information entropy and gain at each reasoning step.

Result: IF-Track successfully models universal human reasoning behaviors, captures essential features, identifies error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. It also reconciles single- and dual-process theories.

Conclusion: IF-Track establishes a quantitative bridge between reasoning theory and measurement, providing mechanistic insights into reasoning architecture and aligning artificial and human cognition.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

TL;DR: AutoResearcher is a transparent, multi-agent system for automated literature-based ideation, integrating structured knowledge curation, diversified idea generation, and expert review to produce diverse, evidence-aligned hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic systems for literature-based ideation lack transparency and control, generating plausible but weakly grounded outputs.

Method: AutoResearcher combines four stages: Structured Knowledge Curation, Diversified Idea Generation, Multi-stage Idea Selection, and Expert Panel Review & Synthesis, with exposed reasoning and tunable agents.

Result: The system generates diverse, plausible hypotheses with evidence, demonstrated in a graph-mining case study.

Conclusion: AutoResearcher offers a transparent, domain-agnostic pipeline for automated ideation, enhancing research creativity and grounding.

Abstract: Effective research relies on organizing extensive information and stimulating
novel solutions. Agentic systems have recently emerged as a promising tool to
automate literature-based ideation. However, current systems often remain
black-box. Their outputs may appear plausible but weakly grounded, with limited
transparency or control for researchers. Our work introduces
\textsc{autoresearcher}, a multi-agent demo system for knowledge-grounded and
transparent ideation. Specifically, \textsc{autoresearcher} integrates
meticulously designed four stages into a unified framework: (A) Structured
Knowledge Curation, (B) Diversified Idea Generation, (C) Multi-stage Idea
Selection, and (D) Expert Panel Review \& Synthesis. Different from prior
pipelines, our system not only exposes intermediate reasoning states, execution
logs, and tunable agents for inspections, but also enables the generation of
hypotheses that are both diverse and evidence-aligned. Our design is also
domain-agnostic: as long as literature sources exist, the same pipeline can be
instantiated in any scientific field. As an illustrative case, we demonstrate
\textsc{autoresearcher} on a graph-mining case study ($k$-truss breaking
problem), where it generates distinct, plausible hypotheses with evidence and
critiques. A live demo and source code are available at

TL;DR: ColorEcosystem is a blueprint addressing challenges in massive-agent ecosystems by enabling personalized, standardized, and trustworthy services through agent carriers, stores, and audits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current massive-agent ecosystems suffer from impersonal experiences, lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior, necessitating a solution like ColorEcosystem.

Method: ColorEcosystem uses three components: agent carrier (personalized service via digital twins), agent store (centralized, standardized platform), and agent audit (ensuring integrity).

Result: The proposed system aims to enhance service quality and trustworthiness in massive-agent ecosystems, with partial implementation already open-sourced.

Conclusion: ColorEcosystem offers a scalable solution for improving agentic services by addressing key challenges in massive-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents,
the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent
systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current
massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service
experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address
these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale.
Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier,
agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service
experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while
the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing
diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of
developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both
service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional
forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across
massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of
ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at

TL;DR: CXRAgent is a director-orchestrated, multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, improving adaptability and reliability through tool coordination, diagnostic planning, and collaborative decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with adaptability and reliability in CXR interpretation.

Method: CXRAgent uses a director-orchestrated approach involving tool invocation with validation, diagnostic planning with expert team assembly, and collaborative decision-making.

Result: CXRAgent performs strongly across CXR tasks, providing visual evidence and generalizing to tasks of varying complexity.

Conclusion: CXRAgent enhances CXR interpretation by ensuring reliability and adaptability through its multi-stage framework.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

TL;DR: CAS is a method using two GPT-2 models to generate original and coherent artistic ideas by balancing compositional fit and cultural typicality, outperforming baselines in human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to generate ideas in art that are both original and coherent, often relying on familiar patterns or losing coherence. CAS aims to address this gap.

Method: CAS employs two fine-tuned GPT-2 models: one for concept coherence and another for cultural typicality. It selects concepts high in coherence but low in typicality.

Result: CAS outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines in human evaluations, matching human art students in originality and harmony. It also produces more diverse outputs.

Conclusion: CAS demonstrates that balancing coherence and cultural alienness can enhance creativity in autonomous agents, offering a viable solution for open-ended domains like art.

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes extensional fuzzy numbers as an alternative to traditional fuzzy sets, addressing computational complexity and fuzzy spread issues in operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fuzzy numbers suffer from high computational complexity and loss of features during operations, limiting their application.

Method: The paper introduces extensional fuzzy numbers, defines operations and relational operators for them, and demonstrates their use with examples and a C++ implementation.

Result: Extensional fuzzy numbers offer a more efficient and feature-preserving alternative to traditional fuzzy sets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach mitigates key limitations of fuzzy numbers, enhancing their practical applicability.

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

TL;DR: The paper explores when AI outputs should override human expert judgment, introducing Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) and AI Preemptionism, critiques classic objections, and proposes a total evidence view for justified AI deference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the ethical and epistemic dilemmas of deferring to AI over human experts, particularly in high-stakes contexts, by examining the conditions under which AI authority is justified.

Method: The author draws on social epistemology, critiques AI Preemptionism, and develops a total evidence view where AI outputs serve as contributory reasons rather than outright replacements.

Result: The proposed total evidence view mitigates expertise atrophy, supports human oversight, and explains justified mistrust of AI when reliability conditions are unmet.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a principled approach to AI deference, balancing AI outputs with human judgment, is necessary for justified reliance, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework improves Text-to-SQL translation for spatial queries, achieving high accuracy with self-verification and outperforming single-agent approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of SQL and geospatial functions limits non-experts' ability to analyze spatial data, despite LLMs' potential for natural language translation.

Method: The framework uses a knowledge base, embeddings, and a multi-agent pipeline with specialized roles for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic, SQL generation, and self-verification.

Result: Achieved 81.2% accuracy on KaggleDBQA and 87.7% on SpatialQueryQA, outperforming single-agent systems and improving semantic alignment with user intent.

Conclusion: The work enhances spatial analysis accessibility and provides a robust foundation for autonomous GIS development.

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: MedAlign addresses challenges in deploying Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical services by introducing a multimodal Direct Preference Optimization objective, Retrieval-Aware Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and federated governance mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in Medical Visual Question Answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models show potential for smart healthcare, but LVLMs face challenges like hallucination, inefficient reasoning, and collaboration difficulties.

Method: Proposes mDPO for visual alignment, RA-MoE for mitigating hallucinations, and federated governance for adaptive reasoning and collaboration.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 11.85% in F1-score and reduces reasoning length by 51.60%.

Conclusion: MedAlign effectively addresses LVLM deployment challenges in clinical settings, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the

*Mingxuan Li,Junzhe Zhang,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm robust to confounding biases in observed data, outperforming standard DQN in confounded environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of off-policy learning in high-dimensional domains with unobserved confounding, where standard methods like DQN may fail.

Method: Extends DQN to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with observations, handling confounding biases.

Result: The proposed algorithm consistently outperforms standard DQN in twelve confounded Atari games.

Conclusion: The new method effectively handles unobserved confounders, improving robustness in off-policy learning.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

*Chunghyun Han,Alfio Gliozzo,Junkyu Lee,Agostino Capponi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An empirical study explores using autonomous AI agents for decentralized governance decisions, demonstrating alignment with human outcomes via blockchain data simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how agentic AI can enhance collective decision-making in decentralized governance by acting as autonomous voters.

Method: Built an AI voter using 3K+ protocol proposals, leveraging historical data and operating in a blockchain-based simulation via modular workflows.

Result: AI decisions closely matched human and token-weighted outcomes, showing interpretable and auditable signals.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can effectively support decentralized governance with rigorous, explainable decision-making.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

### [121] [NeuroGenPoisoning: Neuron-Guided Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation of LLM via Genetic Optimization of External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21144)
*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroGenPoisoning, an attack framework targeting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by exploiting neuron-level sensitivities and genetic optimization to generate effective poisoned external knowledge, achieving high success rates while resolving knowledge conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks on RAG systems overlook internal model dynamics and neuron-level sensitivities, leaving gaps in understanding RAG poisoning mechanisms and the impact of knowledge conflicts.

Method: Proposes NeuroGenPoisoning, which identifies Poison-Responsive Neurons and uses genetic algorithms to evolve adversarial passages that activate these neurons, enabling scalable poisoned knowledge generation.

Result: Achieves a Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over 90% while maintaining fluency and effectively resolves knowledge conflicts.

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning demonstrates a novel and effective approach to RAG poisoning by leveraging neuron attribution and genetic optimization, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt automates prompt and reasoning process design for LLMs, integrating domain knowledge via iterative optimization of Semantic Causal Graphs, achieving higher performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing prompts and reasoning processes for LLMs in domain-specific tasks is challenging and crucial, requiring integration of domain knowledge and efficient reasoning.

Method: EGO-Prompt uses iterative optimization of Semantic Causal Graphs (SCGs) and causal-guided textual gradients to refine prompts and reasoning processes automatically.

Result: EGO-Prompt outperforms cutting-edge methods by 7.32%-12.61% F1, reduces costs by 80%, and enhances interpretability with refined SCGs.

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt effectively automates and optimizes LLM prompting for domain tasks, improving performance, cost-efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSoT is a prompting method for LLMs to improve Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF) by generating entropy through random strings, enhancing diversity and alignment with target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail at PIF tasks, leading to biased outputs harmful for applications like human-behavior simulation and content diversification.

Method: SSoT instructs LLMs to output a random string for entropy, then manipulate it to derive answers, preserving diversity under constraints.

Result: SSoT significantly improves PIF performance, nearing ideal pseudo-random number generator performance, and boosts response diversity in open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: SSoT effectively addresses LLM biases in PIF tasks, enhancing diversity and performance across closed-set and open-ended applications.

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

*Yujin Jo,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuSA-CL is a lightweight, memory-free continual learning framework for VLMs like CLIP, preserving zero-shot capabilities while adapting to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained VLMs lack adaptability in evolving environments, necessitating continual learning methods that avoid forgetting while maintaining zero-shot performance.

Method: NuSA-CL uses low-rank adaptation and constrains weight updates to an approximate null space of current parameters, minimizing interference with prior knowledge.

Result: NuSA-CL preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities and achieves competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: NuSA-CL is a practical, scalable solution for continual learning in zero-shot VLMs, suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

*Shuo Li,Keqin Xu,Jie Liu,Dan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shylock is a novel method for discovering causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS), excelling in few-shot and normal scenarios by reducing parameters exponentially and improving accuracy through global and local constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for causal relationship discovery are error-prone, rely on idealized assumptions, and struggle with data scarcity in MTS. Shylock addresses these gaps.

Method: Shylock uses group dilated convolution and a sharing kernel to reduce parameters exponentially while learning time-delayed variable representations. It combines global and local constraints for better information sharing.

Result: Shylock outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks and generated datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in both few-shot and normal MTS scenarios.

Conclusion: Shylock fills critical gaps in causal discovery for MTS, offering superior performance and practical deployment via the Tcausal library on EarthDataMiner.

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

TL;DR: OutboundEval is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in expert-level outbound calling, addressing dataset diversity, user simulation, and evaluation metrics through a structured framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in existing methods for evaluating LLMs in outbound calling scenarios, such as insufficient dataset diversity, unrealistic user simulation, and inaccurate metrics.

Method: OutboundEval uses a structured framework with scenario-specific benchmarks, a large-model-driven User Simulator, and dynamic evaluation integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment.

Result: Tests on 12 LLMs show trade-offs between task completion and interaction fluency, providing insights for developing human-like outbound AI systems.

Conclusion: OutboundEval sets a practical, extensible standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional outbound calling applications.

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

*Victoria J. Hodge,Colin Paterson,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews OOD detection techniques for ensuring the safety of AI-enabled autonomous systems, focusing on challenges and methodologies for robust safety assurance throughout the system lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of AI-enabled autonomous systems necessitates rigorous safety assurance, particularly in handling novel and uncertain situations like OOD data, to ensure responsible adoption.

Method: The review defines OOD concepts, explores causes and challenges, and identifies techniques applicable across the ML development lifecycle for safety assurance.

Result: A range of OOD detection techniques are identified, along with suggestions for their integration into system lifecycles and caveats for engineers.

Conclusion: Challenges and future work are outlined to advance the safe development and operation of autonomous systems across various domains.

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [128] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates adaptive strategies for the UCT exploration constant λ to make it reward-scale agnostic, recommending a new method choosing λ as 2σ, based on Q-values' empirical standard deviation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UCT algorithms struggle with varying reward scales across games, prompting the need for adaptive λ-strategies.

Method: The study tests existing and five new λ-strategies, focusing on choosing λ based on Q-values' standard deviation (σ).

Result: The proposed strategy (λ = 2σ) outperforms others in various tasks, both in default and optimized parameter scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that λ = 2σ is the most effective and robust λ-strategy for reward-scale agnostic UCT applications.

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

### [129] [When Models Outthink Their Safety: Mitigating Self-Jailbreak in Large Reasoning Models with Chain-of-Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21285)
*Yingzhi Mao,Chunkang Zhang,Junxiang Wang,Xinyan Guan,Boxi Cao,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies Self-Jailbreak in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), where models override their risk assessments to justify unsafe responses. It proposes Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) to improve safety without compromising reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs face safety risks like harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks, with existing solutions harming reasoning ability. The study aims to resolve this trade-off.

Method: Analyzes reasoning trajectories of LRMs to identify Self-Jailbreak, then introduces CoG to backtrack unsafe reasoning steps while preserving valid chains.

Result: CoG enhances LRM safety significantly without loss of reasoning performance, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: CoG effectively addresses the safety-reasoning trade-off in LRMs, offering a robust solution for safer AI deployment.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how AI trustworthiness is conceptualized in AIES and FAccT conferences, highlighting gaps in sociotechnical dimensions and advocating for interdisciplinary approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI trustworthiness research focuses on technical attributes, neglecting sociotechnical factors, which limits understanding of real-world AI impacts.

Method: A scoping review of AIES and FAccT proceedings was conducted to analyze definitions, measurement, validation, and application of AI trustworthiness.

Result: Technical attributes like transparency and robustness are well-defined, but sociotechnical aspects are overlooked, revealing power dynamics in defining trustworthiness.

Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach integrating technical and sociotechnical factors is proposed to advance trustworthy AI and promote responsible development.

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic embodied task planning framework that improves LLM-generated code reliability through symbolic verification and interactive validation, achieving higher task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLM-based code-as-policies approaches, which suffer from poor environmental grounding in dynamic or partially observable settings.

Method: Incorporates symbolic verification and interactive validation during code generation, including exploratory code to interact with the environment.

Result: Improves task success rates by 46.2% over baselines and achieves 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions.

Conclusion: The framework enhances grounding and reliability of task planning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan uses guided exploration with MCTS and a semantic compass to enhance LLM creativity, outperforming ToT and ReAct in generating innovative scientific ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often lack true innovation, relying on familiar concepts. Existing methods like ToT use inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics, limiting exploration.

Method: Magellan employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with hierarchical guidance: a semantic compass for long-range direction and a landscape-aware value function for local decisions.

Result: Magellan outperforms ReAct and ToT in generating scientific ideas with higher plausibility and innovation.

Conclusion: Principled, guided search is more effective for creative discovery, enhancing LLMs' role in innovation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

TL;DR: The paper reviews Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI) methods for LLMs, proposes a taxonomy for symbolic integration, and outlines a roadmap to enhance transparency in LLMs by merging symbolic techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparency in responses, and existing NeSy AI methods are not well-suited for LLMs. The paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically integrating symbolic AI into LLMs.

Method: The paper reviews established NeSy AI methods, proposes a novel taxonomy, and introduces a roadmap with a categorisation framework across four dimensions (integration stages, coupling mechanisms, architectural paradigms, and algorithmic/application perspectives).

Result: The paper identifies current benchmarks, advancements, and gaps in symbolic integration for LLMs, offering practical insights for future research.

Conclusion: The roadmap provides a structured approach to enhance transparency in LLMs through symbolic integration, highlighting critical gaps and future research directions.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for

### [134] [AutoOpt: A Dataset and a Unified Framework for Automating Optimization Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21436)
*Ankur Sinha,Shobhit Arora,Dhaval Pujara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k is a dataset of 11k handwritten and printed optimization models, labeled with LaTeX and modeling language representations. The AutoOpt framework uses deep learning and LLMs to automate optimization problem-solving, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the solution of complex optimization problems from images, reducing human effort and error.

Method: AutoOpt framework includes three modules: M1 (MER via deep learning), M2 (LaTeX-to-PYOMO via fine-tuned LLM), and M3 (BOBD solver).

Result: MER outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini, and Nougat; BOBD surpasses common solvers like interior-point and genetic algorithms.

Conclusion: AutoOpt-11k and AutoOpt framework provide efficient, automated solutions for complex optimization problems.

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

### [135] [Multi-Task Vehicle Routing Solver via Mixture of Specialized Experts under State-Decomposable MDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21453)
*Yuxin Pan,Zhiguang Cao,Chengyang Gu,Liu Liu,Peilin Zhao,Yize Chen,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs) that leverages specialized basis solvers and a State-Decomposable MDP to improve performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified solvers for VRPs underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants, missing the benefits of specialized basis solvers.

Method: Introduces State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) and Latent Space-based SDMDP extension with a Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES).

Result: MoSES outperforms prior methods across VRP variants.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages basis solvers and adaptive reuse to achieve superior performance in VRPs.

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

*Ilija Lichkovski,Alexander Müller,Mariam Ibrahim,Tiwai Mhundwa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench is a benchmark evaluating LLM agents' compliance with EU laws across categories like data protection and bias, measuring their tendency for unlawful actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unpredictable behaviors of LLM agents, especially their potential for illegal actions under EU legislation, necessitate a verifiable benchmark.

Method: EU-Agent-Bench uses human-curated scenarios with compliant/non-compliant execution options, comparing model actions against legal rubrics.

Result: The benchmark evaluates frontier LLMs' legal compliance and tests the effect of legislative excerpts in prompts.

Conclusion: Future work should extend benchmarks to other jurisdictions, multi-turn, and multilingual interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

### [137] [Co-Sight: Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21557)
*Hongwei Zhang,Ji Lu,Shiqing Jiang,Chenxiang Zhu,Li Xie,Chen Zhong,Haoran Chen,Yurui Zhu,Yongsheng Du,Yanqin Gao,Lingjun Huang,Baoli Wang,Fang Tan,Peng Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight improves LLM-based agents' long-horizon reasoning by combining structured factual grounding (TRSF) and conflict-aware verification (CAMV), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning in LLM-based agents.

Method: Uses CAMV for conflict identification and TRSF for organizing and validating structured facts.

Result: Achieves top accuracy on GAIA (84.4%), Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%).

Conclusion: Co-Sight provides a scalable solution for reliable and transparent long-horizon reasoning.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

### [138] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-driven method using learning-based control barrier functions (CBFs) to ensure safety in autonomous systems, especially when failure states are hard to define. It leverages expert demonstrations and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems is critical, but defining failure states is often non-trivial. The paper aims to address this challenge using learned CBFs guided by expert demonstrations.

Method: The approach uses inverse constraint learning (ICL) to train a constraint function classifying states as safe or unsafe. These labels then train a neural CBF, validated via simulated trajectories.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines and matches performance with ground-truth labeled data across four environments.

Conclusion: Learning-based CBFs from expert demonstrations effectively ensure safety even when failure sets are unspecified, offering a practical alternative to computationally expensive synthesis.

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [139] [Huxley-Gödel Machine: Human-Level Coding Agent Development by an Approximation of the Optimal Self-Improving Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21614)
*Wenyi Wang,Piotr Piękos,Li Nanbo,Firas Laakom,Yimeng Chen,Mateusz Ostaszewski,Mingchen Zhuge,Jürgen Schmidhuber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a mismatch between coding agents' benchmark performance and self-improvement potential, proposing a new metric (CMP) and the Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM) to optimize self-modifications, achieving superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch in self-improving coding agents and improve their potential for self-modification by leveraging descendant benchmark performances.

Method: Introduces the CMP metric and the Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM) to guide self-modification searches, outperforming prior methods on benchmarks.

Result: HGM achieves better performance on SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot with less computational time and demonstrates strong transferability to other datasets and models.

Conclusion: HGM optimizes self-improving coding agents effectively, matching human-level performance on benchmarks and offering a scalable approach.

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

*Xiaoxi Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Jiarui Jin,Guanting Dong,Jiajie Jin,Yinuo Wang,Hao Wang,Yutao Zhu,Ji-Rong Wen,Yuan Lu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepAgent is a deep reasoning agent that autonomously handles tasks, tool discovery, and action execution with an innovative memory folding mechanism and reinforcement learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent frameworks lack autonomy and struggle with long-horizon interactions and external tool use.

Method: Introduces autonomous memory folding and ToolPO reinforcement learning for efficient tool use.

Result: Outperforms baselines on eight benchmarks in tool-use tasks and downstream applications.

Conclusion: Advances general and capable agents for real-world tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

TL;DR: The paper introduces AstaBench, a benchmarking suite for evaluating AI agents' ability to perform scientific research, addressing gaps in current benchmarks and revealing that AI still struggles with comprehensive science assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI agents fall short in evaluating real-world scientific research use cases, reproducibility, confounding variables, prototyping interfaces, and baseline comparisons.

Method: The authors define principles and tooling for rigorous benchmarking and present AstaBench, a suite with 2400+ scientific problems, production-grade search tools, and nine optimized agent classes.

Result: Evaluation of 57 agents across 22 classes shows meaningful progress in some areas but highlights AI's limitations in fully assisting scientific research.

Conclusion: Despite advancements, AI agents are not yet capable of fully solving the challenges of scientific research assistance, calling for continued development and benchmarking improvements.

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen is a novel end-to-end strategy for complex multi-ontology matching, outperforming baselines in biomedical tasks by generating semantically sound mappings without restrictions on target ontologies or entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ontology matching methods fall short in providing full semantic integration for related but disjoint ontologies, necessitating a more nuanced approach like CMOM.

Method: CMOMgen uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to select relevant classes and reference mappings, enhancing In-Context Learning for generating mappings.

Result: CMOMgen outperformed baselines in class selection, achieved a minimum 63% F1-score, and 46% of non-reference mappings received the highest score in manual evaluation.

Conclusion: CMOMgen proves effective for semantic integration in multi-ontology scenarios, demonstrating superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark dataset for analyzing framing in PR campaigns via vision-language models, focusing on energy sector ads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between company actions and PR campaigns, especially in oil & gas 'greenwashing'.

Method: Introduce a dataset of expert-annotated video ads from Facebook and YouTube, annotated for 13 framing types across 50+ entities.

Result: Baseline results show GPT-4.1 detects environmental messages at 79% F1, while best model scores 46% F1 on green innovation framing.

Conclusion: The dataset aids multimodal analysis of strategic communication, highlighting VLM challenges like implicit framing and cultural contexts.

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using a Knowledge Graph (KG) bridges high-level mission goals and low-level planning for autonomous agents, enabling adaptable and explainable coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs in dynamic environments.

Method: Introduces a KG with a two-plane architecture that translates declarative facts into agent-specific worldviews and physics-aware rules.

Result: Demonstrated with AUVs in the Gulf of Mexico, showing distinct high-performing outcomes from declarative policies.

Conclusion: The KG serves as a powerful orchestrator for adaptive and explainable autonomous systems, beyond just data storage.

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

*Jiajun Fan,Roger Ren,Jingyuan Li,Rahul Pandey,Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar,Ivan Bulyko,Ankur Gandhe,Ge Liu,Yile Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CESAR proposes a reinforcement learning framework (GRPO) to improve audio LLM reasoning by rewarding consistency and structured analysis, resolving performance degradation with longer reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio LLMs suffer from degraded performance with longer reasoning chains due to inadequate training, leading to errors and hallucinations.

Method: Introduces CESAR, an online reinforcement learning framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards for correctness, consistency, structure, causality, domain knowledge, and reasoning depth.

Result: CESAR achieves state-of-the-art results on MMAU Test-mini and near-human performance on MMSU reasoning tasks, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio.

Conclusion: CESAR transforms reasoning into a performance enhancer for audio LLMs, uncovering model-specific reasoning sweet spots and improving multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRISP is a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework for financial time series forecasting that adapts to changing market regimes, improving portfolio performance during crises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adapt to shifting market dynamics during crises due to reliance on fixed graph topologies.

Method: CRISP combines Graph Convolutional Networks, BiLSTM with self-attention, and multi-head Graph Attention Networks to learn adaptive sparse structures.

Result: CRISP achieves a Sharpe ratio of 3.76, significantly outperforming baselines, and provides interpretable crisis detection through attention weights.

Conclusion: CRISP enables adaptive portfolio allocation by dynamically discovering crisis-relevant asset relationships.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

TL;DR: MOBO-OSD is a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate diverse Pareto optimal solutions by solving constrained subproblems along orthogonal search directions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) focuses on single-objective problems, leaving multi-objective optimization challenging.

Method: MOBO-OSD uses orthogonal search directions (OSDs) based on an approximated convex hull of objective minima, Pareto Front Estimation for denser solutions, and supports batch optimization.

Result: MOBO-OSD outperforms existing algorithms in experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks with 2-6 objectives.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD effectively enhances solution diversity and hypervolume performance, proving superior for multi-objective Bayesian Optimization.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

### [149] [Multimodal Negative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20877)
*Baoquan Gong,Xiyuan Gao,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Bing Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL), a new paradigm addressing modality imbalance by guiding weak modalities to suppress non-target classes, preserving unique information and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome modality imbalance where dominant modalities overshadow weak ones, risking loss of unique information in weak modalities.

Method: Proposes Negative Learning (Learning Not to be) where dominant modalities guide weak ones to suppress non-target classes, stabilizing decision space and preserving modality-specific information.

Result: Theoretically tightens robustness lower bound, increases Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM), and reduces empirical error in weak modalities, especially under noise and imbalance.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments validate MNL's effectiveness and generalizability against competing methods, with code made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

*Danying Ge,Jianhua Gao,Yixue Yang,Weixing Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HA-RAG optimizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation by reducing memory and latency issues through hotness-aware methods, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in long-context processing and high memory consumption in RAG systems.

Method: Introduces hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing, loading, and data placement strategies.

Result: Achieves average 2.10x and maximum 10.49x speedup in TTFT with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: HA-RAG is an effective optimization solution for RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping avoids sharp minima and improves generalization, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of SGD's ability to avoid sharp minima lags behind its empirical success, prompting a deeper analysis of global dynamics.

Method: Develops technical machinery using large deviations and metastability analysis, focusing on injecting and truncating heavy-tailed noises during training.

Result: Heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping avoids sharp minima, finds flatter minima, and improves generalization, confirmed by simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of heavy-tailed SGD in enhancing generalization by avoiding sharp minima, validated theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

*Rattana Pukdee,Ziqi Ke,Chirag Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a regression method for interval targets, proposing a novel min-max learning formulation and achieving state-of-the-art results with smoothness constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression with interval targets is needed when exact target labels are costly or uncertain, requiring new loss functions and methodologies.

Method: The study uses interval-compatible loss functions and proposes a min-max learning approach with smoothness constraints to handle non-convex maximization.

Result: Non-asymptotic generalization bounds are established, and experiments show superior performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively handle interval targets, outperforming existing approaches through novel formulations and smoothness constraints.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

*Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Yue Su,Janghoon Ock,Alan Pham,Sanya Ahuja,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing MAML and a novel mutation encoding strategy improves protein mutation property prediction, achieving better accuracy and faster training across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting protein mutation properties struggle with cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous conditions and limited data. This paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The paper uses Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and a new mutation encoding strategy with separator tokens to integrate mutations into sequence context, leveraging transformer architectures.

Result: Evaluation on three datasets shows significant improvements: 29% better accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training.

Conclusion: This work advances meta-learning for protein mutation analysis and provides a scalable, efficient framework for protein engineering, especially useful where experimental data is scarce.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

### [154] [Safety Assessment in Reinforcement Learning via Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20955)
*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using reversibility and model-predictive path integral control to ensure safety in model-free reinforcement learning without requiring detailed safety specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-free reinforcement learning lacks formal safety guarantees, and existing methods rely on detailed safety knowledge. This work aims to address hard-to-specify safety issues by leveraging invariance.

Method: The approach uses reversibility and model-predictive path integral control to check action safety during training, requiring only black-box dynamics queries.

Result: Experiments show the method successfully prevents unsafe actions while maintaining comparable training progress to unsafe baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a practical way to ensure safety in model-free reinforcement learning without explicit safety constraints or dynamics knowledge.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPFL is an Ensembled Penalized Federated Learning framework designed for fall detection in elderly and disabled individuals, addressing privacy and behavioral variability challenges with improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional fall detection systems, such as generalizability and privacy concerns, EPFL integrates privacy-aware techniques and personalized modeling.

Method: EPFL uses wearable sensor data, homomorphic encryption, federated training, penalized local training, and ensemble-based inference with a Specialized Weighted Aggregation strategy.

Result: EPFL achieves 88.31% Recall and 89.94% F1-score, outperforming centralized and baseline models.

Conclusion: EPFL offers a scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection with adaptive feedback for continuous improvement.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

### [156] [Towards Scalable Oversight with Collaborative Multi-Agent Debate in Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20963)
*Yongqiang Chen,Gang Niu,James Cheng,Bo Han,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ColMAD introduces a collaborative multi-agent debate protocol to improve error detection in LLMs, outperforming competitive methods by 19%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-diagnosis in LLMs is unreliable without external feedback; competitive multi-agent debates often hinder truth-seeking due to debate hacking.

Method: ColMAD reframes multi-agent debate as a non-zero sum game, promoting supportive criticism among agents to enhance error detection.

Result: ColMAD outperforms competitive MAD by 19% and shows improvements over single-agent methods.

Conclusion: Collaborative debate protocols like ColMAD effectively enhance error detection in LLMs by fostering complementary critiques.

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

*Yanzhi Chen,Zijing Ou,Adrian Weller,Michael U. Gutmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new mutual information estimator balancing complexity and capacity using vector copula theory, outperforming existing methods on synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mutual information estimators are either too complex (requiring large datasets) or too simplistic (failing to capture complex distributions), necessitating a better trade-off.

Method: The approach leverages vector copula theory to create an estimator that interpolates between overly flexible and overly simplified models.

Result: The proposed estimator shows superior performance on synthetic benchmarks and diverse real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The new estimator effectively balances complexity and capacity, offering improved mutual information estimation.

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

*Jubilee Lee,Daniele E. Schiavazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Implicit neural representations (INRs) are evaluated for compressing hemodynamic fields and representing cardiovascular anatomies, achieving high compression ratios and accuracy with minimal errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the accuracy and efficiency of INRs in domain-specific applications, particularly in hemodynamic field compression and cardiovascular anatomy representation.

Method: Various strategies to mitigate spectral bias are investigated, including specialized activation functions, positional encoding, and nonlinear kernel combinations. State-of-the-art INR architectures like SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE are evaluated.

Result: INRs achieved compression ratios up to 230 with maximum errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10 cm/s for velocity. Average anatomical discrepancies were below 0.5 mm.

Conclusion: INRs demonstrate significant potential for high-efficiency compression and accurate representation in hemodynamic and anatomical applications, with SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE performing optimally.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

TL;DR: L2M3OF, a multimodal LLM for MOFs, integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding to outperform text-based LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' success in natural language tasks, their impact on scientific discovery, like MOF design, is limited due to the complexity of physical phenomena beyond language.

Method: L2M3OF combines structural, textual, and knowledge modalities using a pre-trained crystal encoder and lightweight projection layer.

Result: L2M3OF outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs in tasks like property prediction and knowledge generation, despite fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches are crucial for understanding porous materials, positioning L2M3OF as a foundation for AI-driven materials discovery.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Method: Introduces LaRa (Layer Ranking) for layer importance and dynamic channel sampling to exploit temporal stability during fine-tuning, enabling efficient parameter exploration within memory budgets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, outperforming existing static and dynamic methods with memory usage as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

Conclusion: MeDyate significantly advances efficient on-device learning by enabling effective fine-tuning under stringent memory limitations.

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework is introduced to reduce computational and memory demands of large language models by using customized lattice codebooks for weight groups, achieving better trade-offs between model size and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant computational resources and memory for inference. Traditional uniform quantization methods often degrade performance, especially in low-bit scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes GLVQ, which assigns each weight group a learnable lattice codebook. It uses Babai rounding for stable optimization during training and simplifies decoding to matrix-vector multiplication.

Result: Experiments show GLVQ achieves a better balance between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization methods.

Conclusion: GLVQ provides an efficient and practical solution for deploying large models under resource constraints, outperforming existing quantization baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a BiGRU-optimized Transformer model for GPU memory demand prediction in deep learning, showing superior performance over traditional ML methods in key metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for accurate GPU memory prediction in deep learning tasks.

Method: Innovatively integrates BiGRU into Transformer architecture and compares it with decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost benchmarks.

Result: The BiGRU-Transformer model outperforms benchmarks with lower MSE, RMSE, MAE errors and higher R2, demonstrating balanced and stable performance.

Conclusion: The model efficiently and accurately predicts GPU memory demand, significantly improving accuracy over traditional methods, aiding resource scheduling and cluster efficiency.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction

*Ignacio Boero,Ignacio Hounie,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Augmented Lagrangian methods for non-convex constrained learning, proving strong duality, convergence, and generalization guarantees, with applications in fairness-constrained classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lagrangian duality is popular for constrained learning, but its application in non-convex settings is limited. The authors aim to address this gap by revisiting Augmented Lagrangian methods.

Method: The study employs Augmented Lagrangian methods, which require minimal modifications and mitigate duality gaps in non-convex settings. It includes proving strong duality and convergence under mild conditions.

Result: The paper demonstrates strong duality, convergence of dual ascent algorithms to optimal solutions, and provides PAC-style generalization guarantees.

Conclusion: Augmented Lagrangian methods are effective for constrained learning, particularly in fairness-constrained classification, offering theoretical guarantees and practical utility.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained
learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to
mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning
settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

*James Ghawaly,Andrew Nicholson,Catherine Schuman,Dalton Diez,Aaron Young,Brett Witherspoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework trains spiking neural networks (SNNs) for binary classification on time series, optimizing architecture and parameters using EONS. It outperforms baselines in detecting radioactive sources and seizure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop SNNs for step-wise binary classification with high precision at low false alarm rates, addressing the need for efficient and sparse neural solutions.

Method: Uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to evolve sparse SNNs, encodes inputs into spike trains, and employs voting ensembles for robustness.

Result: Achieves 51.8% TPR at 1/hr false alarm rate for radioactive source detection (outperforming PCA and deep learning). Seizure detection ensemble reaches 95% TPR with 16% false positives.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in diverse applications with minimal neurons and synapses, low power consumption, and competitive performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

*Enshu Liu,Qian Chen,Xuefei Ning,Shengen Yan,Guohao Dai,Zinan Lin,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DD2 improves one-step sampling for image AR models by avoiding pre-defined mappings and using conditional score distillation, reducing performance gaps and speeding up training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image AR models suffer from slow generation speeds and performance degradation in one-step sampling, which DD2 aims to address.

Method: DD2 uses conditional score distillation to train a one-step generator, leveraging the original AR model as a teacher for latent space scores.

Result: DD2 achieves minimal FID increase (3.40 to 5.43) on ImageNet-256 and outperforms DD1, reducing the performance gap by 67% with faster training.

Conclusion: DD2 advances one-step AR generation, enabling faster and higher-quality modeling.

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

*Yuhong Luo,Austin Hoag,Xintong Wang,Philip S. Thomas,Przemyslaw A. Grabowicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FRG, a framework for learning fair representations with high-confidence guarantees, ensuring bounded demographic disparity in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address fairness concerns in representation learning by ensuring fair outcomes across demographic groups in downstream applications.

Method: FRG leverages an optimized adversarial model to provide high-confidence fairness guarantees with user-defined error thresholds.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets shows FRG consistently bounds unfairness compared to six existing methods.

Conclusion: FRG effectively ensures fairness in representation learning with controllable high-confidence guarantees.

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

### [167] [More Than Memory Savings: Zeroth-Order Optimization Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21019)
*Wanhao Yu,Zheng Wang,Shuteng Niu,Sen Lin,Li Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zeroth-order optimization is explored for continual learning, showing benefits in stability but drawbacks in plasticity, leading to the development of ZO-FC for balanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma in continual learning using zeroth-order optimization.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of ZO optimization applied to CL methods, culminating in the proposal of ZO-FC.

Result: ZO optimization enhances stability but reduces plasticity, and ZO-FC effectively balances both.

Conclusion: ZO-FC offers a practical, memory-efficient solution for on-device continual learning.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

*Konstantinos Christopher Tsiolis,Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Murat A. Erdogdu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how learning rates affect sample complexity in gradient-based algorithms for training neural networks, identifying phase transitions between different regimes and introducing a new training method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of learning rates in feature learning dynamics and improve sample complexity beyond existing methods.

Method: Analyzes gradient-based algorithms, including a novel two-timescales approach with layer-wise learning rates, comparing correlational and non-correlational updates.

Result: Identifies phase transitions between information exponent and generative exponent regimes based on learning rates, showing their critical impact on efficiency.

Conclusion: Learning rate selection is as crucial as algorithm design for achieving computational and statistical efficiency in neural network training.

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: CIPHER is a framework combining symbolic compression, clustering, and human expertise to label complex time series in physics efficiently, demonstrated with solar wind phenomena classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expert annotations for time series in physics are scarce and inconsistent, necessitating robust labeling for machine learning applications.

Method: CIPHER uses iSAX for compression, HDBSCAN for clustering, and human validation to propagate labels systematically.

Result: CIPHER successfully classified solar wind phenomena like coronal mass ejections in OMNI data.

Conclusion: CIPHER offers a scalable solution integrating symbolic representations, unsupervised learning, and expert input to tackle label scarcity in time series.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physics-Consistent Neural Operator (PCNO) and its enhanced version DiffPCNO for accurate, uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting while enforcing physical laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods often ignore physical laws and fail to quantify uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions, necessitating a new approach.

Method: PCNO enforces physical constraints via projection layers, and DiffPCNO adds a diffusion model to handle uncertainties.

Result: Both models achieve high-fidelity predictions while maintaining physical consistency and uncertainty quantification across various systems.

Conclusion: The two-stage framework offers a robust, versatile solution for accurate and uncertainty-aware forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practical, privacy-aware brain-computer interface task, using the LibriBrain corpus for benchmarking and introducing robust evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for non-invasive BCIs focus on simple tasks, leaving application-ready results like Brain-to-Text unaddressed. The study aims to bridge this gap with KWS.

Method: The authors use the LibriBrain corpus for benchmarking, adopt AUPRC and FA/h metrics, and release tools like the pnpl library. A 1-D Conv/ResNet baseline model is introduced.

Result: The reference model achieves 13x the permutation baseline AUPRC, showing task viability. Predictable scaling and word-level factors affecting detectability are also revealed.

Conclusion: KWS is a viable intermediate task for BCIs, with reproducible benchmarks and practical tools provided for further research.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-GPS is a framework for online multi-objective optimization (MOO) that learns a generative model of Pareto sets, incorporates user preferences via preference direction vectors, and avoids explicit hypervolume computation, achieving high-quality results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of online discrete black-box MOO by developing a framework that learns Pareto sets dynamically and incorporates user preferences flexibly.

Method: A-GPS uses a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and conditions a generative model toward high-performing regions. It introduces preference direction vectors for subjective trade-offs and updates the model iteratively.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks show strong sample efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Conclusion: A-GPS provides a simple yet powerful approach for MOO, producing high-quality Pareto set approximations without explicit hypervolume computation and adapting to user preferences.

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing literature, particularly ensuring fairness across classes and handling agents belonging to multiple classes.

Method: Develops a randomized algorithm using a relax-and-round framework with a resource reservation approach (set-aside mechanism) and introduces a learning-augmented variant.

Result: The fractional solution achieves expected performance, with fairness preserved during rounding, and the learning-augmented variant balances fairness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively ensure fairness and performance in online multi-class resource allocation, with practical improvements using predictions.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns in policy optimization due to its sensitive applications like healthcare and robotics.

Method: Formalizes DP definitions for PO, analyzes sample complexity of PO algorithms (PG, NPG, etc.) under DP constraints via a unified framework.

Result: Shows privacy costs often appear as lower-order terms in sample complexity, providing insights for privacy-preserving PO.

Conclusion: The study offers practical insights for developing privacy-aware PO algorithms.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar

(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;

TL;DR: Selecting the shortest answer among multiple solutions improves LLM performance by favoring concise, confident responses over verbose, uncertain ones, reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and reduce computational overhead in strategies that enhance LLM performance by selecting the best solution among multiple samples.

Method: Using the heuristic of selecting the shortest solution from multiple samples, leveraging the observation that shorter answers often come from confident reasoning.

Result: This approach matches the performance of complex methods like self-consistency while significantly lowering computational costs.

Conclusion: The shortest-answer heuristic offers a computationally efficient and effective alternative for improving LLM performance in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Motivation: To advance understanding of Neural Collapse (NC) by exploring its emergence in a two-layer ReLU network with structured data, addressing gaps in prior theoretical work.

Method: Analyzing gradient flow dynamics on a two-layer ReLU network trained with orthogonally separable data.

Result: Provably demonstrates NC emerges under these conditions, revealing the impact of data structure and implicit bias.

Conclusion: The study enhances theoretical insights into NC by incorporating realistic network dynamics and data constraints.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively reduces inference latency on mobile devices by optimizing CPU-GPU co-execution strategies.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

### [179] [DictPFL: Efficient and Private Federated Learning on Encrypted Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21086)
*Jiaqi Xue,Mayank Kumar,Yuzhang Shang,Shangqian Gao,Rui Ning,Mengxin Zheng,Xiaoqian Jiang,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DictPFL is a federated learning framework that ensures full gradient protection with minimal overhead by decomposing model weights and pruning encrypted parameters, achieving significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for secure federated learning using homomorphic encryption are either too costly or leave vulnerabilities; DictPFL aims to bridge this gap.

Method: DictPFL uses DePE to decompose model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup table (only the latter is encrypted) and PrME to prune encrypted parameters.

Result: DictPFL reduces communication by 402-748×, speeds up training by 28-65×, and outperforms selective encryption methods by 51-155× in overhead and 4-19× in speed.

Conclusion: DictPFL demonstrates practical HE-based federated learning with runtime close to plaintext FL, making it viable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

*Yunuo Zhang,Baiting Luo,Ayan Mukhopadhyay,Gabor Karsai,Abhishek Dubey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESCORT is a particle-based framework for accurately representing complex, multi-modal belief distributions in POMDPs, outperforming existing methods by addressing high-dimensionality and correlation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard belief approximation methods in POMDPs struggle with complex uncertainty structures like high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions, leading to suboptimal agent behaviors.

Method: ESCORT uses particle-based framework with correlation-aware projections and temporal consistency constraints, extending SVGD for accurate modeling of intricate correlations.

Result: ESCORT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in belief approximation accuracy and downstream decision quality across POMDP domains and synthetic distributions.

Conclusion: ESCORT effectively captures complex belief distributions in POMDPs, addressing limitations of existing methods and improving decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses selecting costly features for models that perform well across subpopulations, using a noising mechanism without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature collection is costly, necessitating efficient selection methods for high-quality models across diverse populations.

Method: Frames selection as continuous relaxation with a noising mechanism, optimizing Bayes-optimal predictor variance.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world data, showing balanced performance across populations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is model-agnostic and effective for feature selection in costly settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

TL;DR: SolarBoost introduces a novel method for forecasting power output in distributed photovoltaic systems by modeling aggregated output as a composite of small grids, overcoming challenges like data variability and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized photovoltaic methods struggle with distributed systems due to issues like missing data and geographic variability, prompting the need for SolarBoost.

Method: SolarBoost models aggregated power output using small grids, decoupling unit output functions from dynamic capacity, and employs efficient algorithms for computational efficiency.

Result: The method reduces potential losses and improves accuracy, validated through deployment in Chinese cities.

Conclusion: SolarBoost offers an effective solution for DPV power output forecasting, enhancing grid operation insights.

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

TL;DR: A Two-tier DDPG-based framework is proposed to schedule sequential healthcare workflows in MIoT, minimizing makespan by hierarchically selecting layers and assigning nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIoT requires low-latency scheduling for sequential workflows across cloud-fog-edge infrastructures, a challenging NP-hard problem.

Method: The framework uses global and local controllers for hierarchical layer selection and node assignment.

Result: Experiments show superior performance over baselines, especially for complex workflows.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns long-term strategies, proving suitable for large-scale MIoT scheduling.

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

TL;DR: The study introduces an uncertainty-aware RL framework to improve 3D molecular diffusion models, addressing multi-objective constraints in drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with controlling multi-objective constraints in molecular design, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: An RL framework with surrogate models and predictive uncertainty estimation dynamically shapes reward functions to balance optimization objectives.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines in molecular quality and property optimization, with MD simulations and ADMET profiling showing promising drug-like behavior.

Conclusion: RL-guided generative diffusion models show strong potential for advancing automated molecular design.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified matrix factorization framework for crisp and fuzzy clustering, extending it to robust variants using l1,2-norm and developing convergent algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and unify matrix factorization interpretations for crisp and fuzzy clustering, addressing outlier sensitivity.

Method: Extends clustering paradigms to matrix factorization, proposes robust formulations with l1,2-norm, and develops alternating minimization and IRLS-based algorithms.

Result: Theoretical convergence proofs for all algorithms to local minima are provided.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies and robustifies clustering methods with provable convergence.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe improves the tradeoff between average reward and reducing undesired outputs in RL alignment for language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods optimize average reward but struggle to reduce undesired outputs without sacrificing performance. RePULSe aims to address this tradeoff.

Method: RePULSe adds an extra loss to standard RL training, using learned proposals to sample and reduce low-reward outputs.

Result: Experiments show RePULSe achieves a better balance between expected reward and minimizing undesired outputs, with improved robustness.

Conclusion: RePULSe offers a more effective approach for RL alignment in language models by enhancing reward tradeoffs and adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A visual big data system for meteorology uses NoSQL databases and predictive analysis to handle high-volume weather data, achieving low error rates and high usability scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meteorology generates large, complex datasets with missing values and high correlations, necessitating advanced Big Data techniques for analysis and prediction.

Method: The system collects open weather data, stores it in a NoSQL database, and uses temporal/spatial aggregation with univariate/multivariate approaches for predictive tasks, including neighbor station training for missing values.

Result: Achieves a normalized mean squared error of 0.00013 and directional symmetry of ~0.84, with positive usability ratings from experts (mostly ≥3/5).

Conclusion: The system shows promise for meteorology data analysis, encouraging further development despite minor design critiques.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

*Tomer Galanti,Aarya Bookseller,Korok Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bilevel max-max optimization framework for contract design is introduced, using modern ML techniques to solve analytically intractable problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of designing optimal contracts in complex, nonlinear environments where closed-form solutions are unavailable, leveraging applications in moral hazard and contract theory.

Method: The method employs implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients to compute hypergradients efficiently, avoiding Hessian formation or inversion, making it matrix-free and problem-agnostic.

Result: The framework successfully recovers known analytical optima in benchmark cases and extends to complex scenarios like sigmoidal wage schedules and multi-task contracts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a powerful computational tool for contract design, enabling the study of previously intractable models.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

TL;DR: SANIsanitizespre-trainedlanguage models by unlearning sensitive data through erasure and repair phases, reducing memorization without costly re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models fine-tuned on specialized data may memorize sensitive information, posing privacy risks. SANI addresses this without expensive re-training.

Method: SANIsanitizesmodels via an unlearning approach: erasure (resetting neurons to disrupt memorization) and repair (fine-tuning without memorizing sensitive data).

Result: SANIdrastically reduces regurgitations of sensitive data with minimal additional epochs, proving effective for sanitizing models.

Conclusion: SANIsanitizesmodels efficiently, making it valuable for industries like healthcare needing to share models while protecting sensitive data.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of continual learning where models must adapt to new tasks without degrading past knowledge.

Method: PLAN introduces orthogonal basis vectors for tasks, optimizes them with perturbation-based strategies, and uses a selection mechanism to minimize interference.

Result: Empirical results show PLAN outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: PLAN effectively balances efficient adaptation and knowledge retention in continual learning for large pre-trained models.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairImagen is a post-hoc debiasing framework for text-to-image diffusion models to mitigate societal biases without retraining the model. It uses Fair PCA and noise injection to improve fairness across demographic attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the replication and amplification of societal biases (e.g., gender, race) in text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.

Method: Introduces FairImagen, which applies Fair PCA to CLIP embeddings, injects empirical noise, and uses cross-demographic projection for simultaneous debiasing.

Result: FairImagen significantly improves fairness with moderate trade-offs in image quality and prompt fidelity, outperforming existing post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: FairImagen provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the utility and implications of LLMs in scientific peer reviewing is crucial for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of the scientific process.

Method: The authors created GenReview, a dataset of 81K LLM-generated reviews for ICLR submissions (2018--2025) using negative, positive, and neutral prompts, linked to original papers and reviews.

Result: LLMs exhibit biases, their reviews are detectable, they don't always follow instructions, and their ratings align with acceptance but not rejection decisions.

Conclusion: GenReview enables extensive research on LLMs in peer reviewing, highlighting current limitations and potential biases.

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [193] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a second-order surrogate loss method for optimizing AUC in classification tasks, overcoming challenges like non-convexity and high memory costs. It achieves tighter regret bounds and demonstrates efficiency in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The AUC is crucial for imbalanced classification but faces optimization difficulties due to non-convexity and memory bottlenecks. The paper aims to address these issues.

Method: Introduces a second-order surrogate loss using pairwise hinge loss and develops an efficient online algorithm. It replaces aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate based on data statistics.

Result: Achieves a tighter $О(лн T)$ regret bound compared to existing $О(суареT)$ bounds, with superior performance shown in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively optimizes AUC, offering improved efficiency and theoretical guarantees, and extends to nonlinear settings via kernels.

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates key properties of synthetic priors for tabular foundation models (TFMs), introduces Mitra—a TFM trained on diverse synthetic priors—and shows it outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs like TabPFNv2 and TabICL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of guiding principles for designing synthetic priors in TFMs, which generalize well without real-world data.

Method: The authors systematically analyze synthetic priors and introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on curated synthetic priors selected for diversity and performance.

Result: Mitra outperforms TabPFNv2 and TabICL across classification and regression benchmarks with better sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of synthetic prior design for TFMs and demonstrates Mitra's effectiveness in improving generalization.

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

*Yunlong Chu,Minglai Shao,Zengyi Wo,Bing Hao,Yuhang Liu,Ruijie Wang,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADaMoRE introduces an adaptive, unsupervised framework for GNNs using Mixture-of-Experts to handle diverse real-world graphs, improving stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with diverse graph structures and tasks due to fixed architectures; MoE offers adaptability but suffers from instability and reliance on supervision.

Method: ADaMoRE uses a backbone-residual expert architecture with structurally-aware gating and unsupervised training, combining reconstruction tasks and diversity regularization.

Result: ADaMoRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning, with improved generalization and efficiency.

Conclusion: ADaMoRE provides a robust, adaptable solution for GNNs, outperforming existing methods across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

### [196] [On the flow matching interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21210)
*Francesco Pivi,Simone Gazza,Davide Evangelista,Roberto Amadini,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to make flow-matching generative models interpretable by constraining intermediate steps to known physical distributions, specifically using the 2D Ising model, improving both fidelity and speed over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability in intermediate steps of flow-matching generative models by embedding physical semantics.

Method: Constrain flow steps to equilibrium states of the 2D Ising model, using an encoder-flow matching-projector architecture with temperature-driven diffusion.

Result: Validated across lattice sizes, the framework preserves physical fidelity and outperforms Monte Carlo generation in speed, with interpretable steps.

Conclusion: Embedding physical semantics transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable processes, enhancing flow-matching models.

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

*Faisal Hamman,Pasan Dissanayake,Yanjun Fu,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoD introduces counterfactual explanations (CFEs) to enhance few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation, reducing data dependency and improving student model performance by focusing on decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task-aware distillation methods require large datasets, which are often scarce or costly. CoD aims to address this by utilizing CFEs to transfer knowledge efficiently.

Method: CoD leverages CFEs—minimally perturbed inputs that flip teacher predictions—to map decision boundaries accurately with fewer samples, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Result: CoD outperforms standard distillation in few-shot regimes (8-512 samples), using only half the baseline data while improving performance across datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: CoD proves effective for few-shot distillation, offering a data-efficient solution by integrating CFEs to better mimic teacher decision boundaries.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

TL;DR: FDA is a novel framework for model merging that operates in the input-representation space, aligning gradients with task vectors for robust and flexible integration of knowledge from multiple checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods struggle with parameter inconsistencies, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: FDA uses synthetic inputs (Functional Dual Anchors) whose gradients align with task vectors, capturing task-specific shifts relative to the pretrained model.

Result: FDAs improve model merging by offering robustness and flexibility, complementing parameter-space methods.

Conclusion: FDA bridges joint multi-task training and post-hoc merging, demonstrating effectiveness in comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

*Waris Radji,Odalric-Ambrym Maillard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of constructing most confusing instances in reinforcement learning (RL) for neural network world models, proposing an adversarial training solution and linking confusion to model uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to extend the concept of most confusing instances—key for regret lower bounds in RL—from simpler settings (like bandits) to neural network world models, where its construction is unclear.

Method: The authors formalize the problem as constrained optimization and solve it using adversarial training, testing their approach on various world models.

Result: Empirical findings indicate that achievable confusion correlates with model uncertainty, potentially guiding exploration strategies in deep model-based RL.

Conclusion: The work bridges a theoretical gap in RL and suggests practical insights for improving exploration in complex environments.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical insights into the training dynamics of SGLD, a continuous-time approximation of stochastic gradient descent, particularly in the lazy training regime.

Method: The study uses non-asymptotic convergence analysis under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function, focusing on multiplicative and state-dependent noise.

Result: SGLD achieves exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation and maintains a non-degenerate kernel during training with high probability. Finite-time and finite-width bounds are also established.

Conclusion: The theoretical findings are supported by numerical examples, validating the efficacy of SGLD in the regression setting.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a central library for testing diverse RNN variants limits reproducibility and exploration.

Method: Developed three libraries in Julia and Python to standardize RNN implementations with customization options.

Result: Created accessible, consistent frameworks for RNN construction and extension under MIT license.

Conclusion: These libraries facilitate easier experimentation and reproducibility in RNN research.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address
challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central
library is available to test these variations, and reimplementing diverse
architectures can be time-consuming and error-prone, limiting reproducibility
and exploration. Here, we introduce three open-source libraries in Julia and
Python that centralize numerous recurrent cell implementations and higher-level
recurrent architectures. torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and
LuxRecurrentLayers.jl offer a consistent framework for constructing and
extending RNN models, providing built-in mechanisms for customization and
experimentation. All packages are available under the MIT license and actively

TL;DR: The paper proposes PINN Balls, a local Mixture of Experts model with learnable domain decomposition, enabling efficient second-order training for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) while maintaining scalability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory inefficiency of second-order methods in training PINNs, the paper introduces a scalable and accurate alternative that combines ensemble models and sparse coding.

Method: The authors develop PINN Balls, which uses a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS) for learnable domain decomposition, optimizing PDE training.

Result: PINN Balls outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and scalability for scientific machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully balances efficiency and accuracy in PINN training, leveraging theoretical and practical advancements.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

*Junshu Sun,Wanxing Chang,Chenxue Yang,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wideformer addresses over-aggregating in graph attention by parallelizing aggregations and prioritizing informative messages, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-aggregating in graph attention dilutes key messages and causes information loss due to indiscriminate aggregation of many nodes.

Method: Wideformer divides node aggregation into parallel processes and guides focus on specific subsets to avoid dilution and prioritize informative messages.

Result: Wideformer mitigates over-aggregating, enabling backbone methods to achieve superior performance over baselines.

Conclusion: Wideformer effectively reduces over-aggregating and enhances graph attention performance.

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

### [204] [Buffer layers for Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21271)
*Hyeongyu Kim,Geonhui Han,Dosik Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Buffer layer as a novel alternative to normalization-based Test Time Adaptation (TTA), addressing instability, generalization issues, and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods rely heavily on normalization layers, which are unstable with small batch sizes and constrained by pre-trained model statistics, limiting effectiveness under domain shifts.

Method: The authors propose a Buffer layer that preserves the pre-trained model's backbone integrity, avoiding direct parameter updates and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Experiments show the Buffer layer outperforms traditional TTA methods in domain shift mitigation, robustness enhancement, and resilience to forgetting.

Conclusion: The Buffer layer is versatile, modular, and improves performance across various architectures, offering a promising solution for real-world domain adaptation.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVC proposes a budget-aware data selection method for MLPs by evaluating data contributions dynamically, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods for MLPs oversimplify nonlinear transformations or are computationally infeasible for large networks.

Method: DVC decomposes data contribution into LVC and GVC, using six metrics to assess quality, relevance, and diversity, and integrates UCB for adaptive selection.

Result: DVC consistently outperforms baselines across six datasets, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores under budget constraints.

Conclusion: DVC provides a systematic, theoretically grounded approach for hierarchical data evaluation in large-scale MLPs.

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the computational complexity of generating explanations for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), revealing varied outcomes based on input space structure, component models, task types, and model forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that GAMs are inherently interpretable and easy to explain, examining the complexities involved in generating explanations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of computational complexity for explaining GAMs, considering input space structure, component models, task types (regression vs. classification), and model forms.

Result: Key findings include: explanation complexity depends on input space structure, varies with component models under specific domains, differs between regression and classification, and benefits certain explanation methods for additive neural models.

Conclusion: The study provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding when explaining GAMs is feasible or computationally hard.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPHAD is a test-time adaptation framework for unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) that improves performance on contaminated datasets by integrating prior knowledge from AD models and evidence from multimodal foundation models or classical AD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies, degrading AD performance. Existing solutions lack practicality due to reliance on training pipelines or prior knowledge of anomaly proportions.

Method: EPHAD updates AD model outputs at test time by combining prior knowledge from contaminated datasets with evidence from multimodal models (e.g., CLIP) or classical AD methods.

Result: Validated across 8 visual, 26 tabular, and 1 industrial AD dataset, EPHAD shows robustness to varying contamination levels and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: EPHAD is versatile and effective for improving AD performance on contaminated datasets without requiring access to training pipelines or detailed prior knowledge.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel probabilistic framework using amortized variational inference improves efficiency and accuracy in partial-label learning by directly approximating the true label posterior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of noisy and ambiguous real-world data, especially in crowdsourcing, where conflicting labels arise.

Method: Uses neural networks to predict variational parameters for amortized variational inference, combining deep learning with probabilistic modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and efficiency on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully integrates deep learning expressiveness with rigorous probabilistic modeling, offering a scalable solution for partial-label learning.

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

*Prakhar Ganesh,Hsiang Hsu,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how small differences in datasets (single-data-point changes) affect model multiplicity, finding counterintuitively that greater inter-class overlap reduces multiplicity. It extends this framework to active learning and data imputation, proposing new methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the overlooked role of data in model multiplicity and address it through granular analysis of neighbouring datasets.

Method: Introduces a neighbouring datasets framework to study single-data-point impacts, backed by proofs, and extends it to active learning and data imputation.

Result: Greater inter-class overlap in neighbouring datasets reduces multiplicity, contrary to expectations. Novel multiplicity-aware methods are proposed.

Conclusion: The study highlights data's critical role in multiplicity and offers practical solutions for active learning and data imputation.

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural

### [210] [Revisiting Social Welfare in Bandits: UCB is (Nearly) All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21312)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Nishant Pandey,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nash regret and p-mean regret as fairer metrics in multi-armed bandits, showing that a simple UCB-based method achieves near-optimal Nash regret and generalizes well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regret metrics fail to address fairness in reward distribution, especially in contexts like clinical trials where fairness among agents (e.g., patients) is crucial.

Method: Proposes an initial uniform exploration phase followed by a standard UCB algorithm, relying on additive Hoeffding bounds and extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Generalizes this to p-mean regret.

Result: Achieves near-optimal Nash regret with minimal assumptions and extends optimally to p-mean regret across all p values, outperforming prior restrictive approaches.

Conclusion: The UCB-based method is versatile, requiring fewer assumptions, and provides fairer regret metrics, making it suitable for broader applications.

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

### [211] [A Convergence Analysis of Adaptive Optimizers under Floating-point Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21314)
*Xuan Tang,Jichu Li,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of theoretical understanding of why low-precision training remains effective for large language models (LLMs), introducing the first framework to analyze adaptive optimizers like Adam and Muon under floating-point quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence theories ignore hardware-aware quantization, leaving unclear why low-precision training works despite quantization errors.

Method: Introduces a theoretical framework analyzing convergence of adaptive optimizers (Adam, Muon) under quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states.

Result: Shows close convergence rates to full-precision counterparts if mantissa length scales logarithmically. Reveals Adam's sensitivity to quantization and Muon's robustness.

Conclusion: Narrows the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training, supported by numerical experiments.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

TL;DR: ScoreNF is a score-based learning framework integrated with Normalizing Flow and Independent Metropolis-Hastings, designed for efficient sampling from unnormalized distributions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sampling methods like MCMC have limitations such as slow convergence and high autocorrelation, while data-driven methods require large datasets and suffer from mode issues.

Method: ScoreNF combines score-based learning with Normalizing Flow and Independent Metropolis-Hastings to enable unbiased sampling, even with small training sets.

Result: ScoreNF shows high performance on synthetic 2D distributions and high-dimensional field theory, reducing reliance on expensive training data.

Conclusion: ScoreNF provides an effective solution for sampling unnormalized distributions, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAVEN is a framework that improves weak-to-strong generalization under distribution shifts by dynamically combining weak models and strong model parameters, outperforming baselines by 30% on out-of-distribution tasks while maintaining performance on in-distribution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge arises as superhuman models grow complex, making human supervision impractical. Weak models supervising strong ones often fail under distribution shifts, degrading performance.

Method: RAVEN dynamically learns optimal combinations of weak models and strong model parameters to enhance robustness under distribution shifts.

Result: RAVEN outperforms baselines by over 30% on out-of-distribution tasks and matches or exceeds existing methods on in-distribution tasks, prioritizing accurate weak models.

Conclusion: RAVEN effectively addresses weak-to-strong generalization challenges, particularly under distribution shifts, by intelligently leveraging weak supervision.

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of reparameterization methods for fine-tuning pre-trained models, focusing on improving generalization. It validates the approach theoretically and experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models through improved reparameterization methods.

Method: Introduces a new class of reparameterization methods, leveraging Random Matrix Theory for theoretical validation and practical fine-tuning experiments like LLMs.

Result: The approach proves effective in high-dimensional binary classification and realistic fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: The new reparameterization methods successfully improve generalization in fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

*Jaesik Yoon,Hyeonseo Cho,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-MCTD extends MCTD by enabling global-aware planning, parallel exploration, and leveraging cached plans, overcoming limitations of local trajectory confinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD is limited by local trajectory exploration and lacks global context, hindering longer plan generation.

Method: C-MCTD introduces three components: Online Composer for global-aware planning, Distributed Composer for parallel exploration, and Preplan Composer for accelerated inference using cached plans.

Result: The framework elevates planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete plan compositions.

Conclusion: C-MCTD overcomes MCTD's limitations by integrating global context and parallel exploration, enhancing plan generation efficiency.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

*Junda Wang,Minghui Hu,Ning Li,Abdulaziz Al-Ali,Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in online task-free class incremental learning (OTCIL) by proposing a randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) to resist forgetting and enhance performance. It introduces edRVFL-kF and its Bayesian variant, edRVFL-kF-Bayes, for efficient, one-pass learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of non-i.i.d batch streams and memory loss in long task streams in OTCIL, aiming for efficient decision-making and reduced cumulative regrets.

Method: The method involves a randomized neural network with forward regularization, integrating unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization. It introduces edRVFL-kF for closed-form updates and edRVFL-kF-Bayes for adaptive tuning via Bayesian learning.

Result: Experiments on image datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed frameworks, showing superior performance in avoiding forgetting and adapting to non-i.i.d data.

Conclusion: The proposed OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles effectively address forgetting and non-i.i.d challenges, offering practical solutions for incremental learning.

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

*Dong Bok Lee,Aoxuan Silvia Zhang,Byungjoo Kim,Junhyeon Park,Steven Adriaensen,Juho Lee,Sung Ju Hwang,Hae Beom Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-sensitive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) method using freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO) with a utility function to balance performance and computational cost. It introduces novel acquisition and stopping criteria, improves sample efficiency via transfer learning, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for early-stopping HPO when expected performance gains don't justify computational costs, by integrating user preferences into the optimization process.

Method: Introduces a utility function for cost-performance trade-off, a novel acquisition function, and stopping criteria within freeze-thaw BO. Enhances sample efficiency with transfer learning for surrogate modeling.

Result: Validated on benchmarks, the method outperforms prior freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO approaches, achieving better cost-performance balance.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively optimizes hyperparameters cost-sensitively, maximizing utility while minimizing unnecessary computational expense.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

TL;DR: Transparent AI assistance improves accuracy and reduces variability in clinical workflows, with post-hoc QC timing being most effective but start-time assistance preferred for speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how AI systems can be effectively integrated into clinical practice by assessing the impact of transparency and timing on clinician trust and performance.

Method: User study with sleep medicine practitioners scoring arousal events under manual, black-box AI, and transparent white-box AI conditions, with assistance timing varied (start or QC review).

Result: AI assistance outperforms manual scoring, with transparent QC timing improving accuracy by 30% over black-box, though it takes longer. Start-time assistance is faster and preferred.

Conclusion: Strategically timed transparent AI balances accuracy and efficiency, enhancing trust and adoption in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

### [220] [Disentangled Representation Learning via Modular Compositional Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21402)
*Whie Jung,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular inductive bias called 'compositional bias' for disentangled representation learning, enabling disentanglement of attributes and objects without redesigning objectives or architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL methods require factor-specific strategies for attributes or objects, leading to overhead when novel factors or multiple coexisting factors are introduced.

Method: Introduces compositional bias with random latent remixing based on factor-specific rules, using a prior loss and compositional consistency loss.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance in attribute and object disentanglement and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of style and objects.

Conclusion: The compositional bias framework offers flexibility and effectiveness in disentangling diverse factors without modifying objectives or architectures.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper explores how associative learning impacts representational changes in large language models (LLMs), revealing non-monotonic patterns and vocabulary interference effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand representational dynamics in associative learning by leveraging LLMs as scalable and controllable models.

Method: Adapting a cognitive neuroscience paradigm to LLMs, examining representation evolution across six models.

Result: Found non-monotonic plasticity and vocabulary interference effects, where differentiation is influenced by item similarity and global competition.

Conclusion: LLMs serve as valuable tools for studying human-like learning and generating hypotheses about memory reorganization.

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

*Guanxiong Luo,Shoujin Huang,Yanlong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-diffusion is a novel framework for solving inverse problems without pretrained models, using iterative noising-denoising steps and a self-denoiser.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion methods require pretrained models, which limits flexibility and applicability.

Method: Self-diffusion alternates between noising and denoising steps, using a randomly initialized convolutional network trained via data fidelity loss.

Result: Competitive or superior performance on linear inverse problems compared to other methods.

Conclusion: Self-diffusion offers a flexible, pretraining-free solution adaptable to various inverse problems.

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PIELM, a faster and more accurate alternative to PINNs for solving inverse Stefan problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the shortcomings of PINNs in hyperparameter dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy for inverse Stefan problems.

Method: Develops PIELM, replacing deep neural networks with extreme learning machines and optimizing output weights via physical law loss vectors.

Result: PIELM improves prediction accuracy by 3-7 orders of magnitude and reduces training time by over 94% compared to PINNs.

Conclusion: PIELM offers a superior, efficient framework for solving inverse Stefan problems.

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

TL;DR: GSAC combines causal representation learning with meta actor-critic learning to tackle scalability and domain generalization in large-scale networked systems, achieving rapid adaptation and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of scale and environment shifts in large-scale networked systems like traffic and power grids.

Method: Uses causal representation learning to identify minimal neighborhood variables, then meta actor-critic training for shared policies across domains.

Result: Achieves exponentially tight representations, efficient learning, and rapid adaptation with few trajectories.

Conclusion: GSAC outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation methods with proven theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

### [226] [Unified token representations for sequential decision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21448)
*Zhuojing Tian,Yushu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Unified Token Representation (UTR) to streamline tokenization in offline RL, reducing redundancy and computation while maintaining performance with transformer and CNN variants UDT and UDC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Decision Transformer suffer from redundant tokenization and high attention complexity, limiting scalability.

Method: Proposes UTR to merge return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, reducing sequence length. Theoretical analysis supports improved generalization.

Result: UTR variants UDT and UDC match or outperform state-of-the-art methods with lower computation.

Conclusion: UTR generalizes well across architectures, offering an efficient foundation for scalable control in large decision models.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

*Jorge Díez,Pablo Pérez-Núñez,Oscar Luaces,Beatriz Remeseiro,Antonio Bahamonde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores learning personalized explanations for Recommender Systems (RS) by predicting user-uploaded photos, enhancing reliability and providing insights into customer preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RS reliability and understand customer preferences through personalized explanations derived from user-uploaded photos.

Method: Predicts user-uploaded photos to justify recommendations, using a formal framework estimating authorship probability for user-photo pairs. Data from TripAdvisor reviews with photos is used.

Result: Demonstrates that predicting user photos can serve as effective explanations for RS recommendations and provides insights into product aspects highlighted by customers.

Conclusion: Personalized explanations via predicted photos enhance RS reliability and offer valuable insights for companies about customer preferences.

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

*Daan Caljon,Jente Van Belle,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HINet proposes a method combining graph neural networks and domain adversarial training to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in networks, addressing interference and covariate shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal machine learning methods assume known exposure mappings and overlook the impact of homophily-induced covariate shift on treatment effect estimates.

Method: HINet integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training to handle unknown exposure mappings and mitigate network-level covariate shift.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show HINet effectively estimates treatment effects under these challenges.

Conclusion: HINet offers a robust solution for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in networked data, overcoming key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZEN is a parameter-free hypergraph neural network that addresses overfitting and scalability issues in few-shot node classification, achieving high accuracy and speedups without iterative training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hypergraph neural networks face overfitting and scalability problems due to complex architectures, prompting the need for a simpler, efficient, and interpretable model.

Method: ZEN introduces a linear, parameter-free model with a closed-form solution for the weight matrix and redundancy-aware propagation, eliminating iterative training.

Result: ZEN outperforms eight baselines in accuracy across 11 benchmarks and achieves up to 696x speedups, with fully interpretable decision processes.

Conclusion: ZEN provides an efficient, scalable, and interpretable solution for few-shot node classification on hypergraphs.

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

*Khaled Hallak,Oudom Kem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmarking framework to study catastrophic forgetting in federated continual time series forecasting, evaluates mitigation strategies, and provides tools for advancing the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a major issue in continual learning, especially in federated learning with non-i.i.d. time series data, yet regression-based forecasting is underexplored.

Method: The study uses the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 clients to evaluate strategies like Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic Intelligence.

Result: The framework enables systematic evaluation of CF mitigation strategies and offers reproducible open-source tools.

Conclusion: This work provides critical insights and tools for improving continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

*Jens E. d'Hondt,Wieger R. Punter,Odysseas Papapetrou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM) is introduced as a method to generate synthetic data preserving full correlation structure, addressing limitations of current techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet data privacy needs and robust modeling demands by overcoming the failure of existing methods in preserving complex correlation structures.

Method: Uses Cholesky decomposition of a target correlation matrix to ensure datasets retain pairwise and higher-order correlations.

Result: Produces synthetic data that preserves the entire correlation structure of the source dataset, enhancing realism for modeling tasks.

Conclusion: GCM offers a promising approach for applications like privacy-preserving data sharing and robust model training.

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

*Tanmay Devale,Pramith Devulapalli,Steve Hanneke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends uniform mean estimation beyond empirical mean estimators, introducing UME-learnability, and shows separability of mean vectors is sufficient but not necessary for it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the concept of uniform mean estimation from empirical mean estimators to arbitrary estimators, addressing limitations in prior work.

Method: Introduces Uniform Mean Estimability (UME-learnability), analyzes separability of mean vectors, and constructs non-separable yet UME-learnable examples.

Result: Separability is sufficient for UME-learnability but not necessary; countable unions of UME-learnable collections are also UME-learnable.

Conclusion: The framework broadens understanding of uniform mean estimation, resolving conjectures and opening new avenues for analysis.

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

*Ramón Nartallo-Kaluarachchi,Robert Manson-Sawko,Shashanka Ubaru,Dongsung Huh,Małgorzata J Zimoń,Lior Horesh,Yoshua Bengio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to quantify uncertainty in generative flow networks by using a surrogate model based on polynomial chaos expansion, enabling Monte Carlo sampling for policy uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward functions in generative flow networks are often estimated from noisy data, leading to epistemic uncertainty in policies, which this work aims to quantify.

Method: A surrogate model of polynomial chaos expansion is constructed from an ensemble of trained flow networks to map reward functions to action probability distributions, allowing inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling.

Result: The approach is demonstrated on discrete/continuous grid-worlds, symbolic regression, and Bayesian structure learning, showing efficacy in policy uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed surrogate model effectively quantifies policy uncertainty in generative flow networks with uncertain rewards.

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

### [234] [A Unified Model for Multi-Task Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21525)
*Huatian Gong,Jiuh-Biing Sheu,Zheng Wang,Xiaoguang Yang,Ran Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified model (UM) for drone routing in post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) addresses multiple problem variants efficiently, outperforming traditional and single-task methods while enabling real-time solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods and single-task deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches are inefficient and inflexible for large-scale PDRA. A unified solution is needed to improve adaptability and performance.

Method: The UM uses a single neural network trained across multiple PDRA problem configurations, leveraging a transformer encoder-decoder architecture and lightweight adapter mechanism for flexibility.

Result: UM reduces training time and parameters by 8x, outperforms single-task DRL by 6-14% and traditional methods by 24-82%, and provides real-time solutions for networks up to 1,000 nodes.

Conclusion: The UM offers a computationally efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA, advancing neural combinatorial optimization for time-critical applications.

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

*Tala Aljaafari,Varun Kanade,Philip Torr,Christian Schroeder de Witt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEEDEE is a simple yet effective OOD detector for RL, using minimal statistics to outperform contemporary methods with significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings faces challenges due to brittleness under distribution shifts, necessitating robust OOD detection methods.

Method: DEEDEE introduces a two-statistic detector utilizing episodewise mean and RBF kernel similarity to capture global and local deviations in RL time series.

Result: DEEDEE matches or surpasses existing detectors in performance, achieving a 600-fold reduction in compute and a 5% absolute accuracy gain.

Conclusion: The study suggests that diverse anomalies in RL can be detected compactly using low-order statistics, providing a foundation for efficient OOD detection.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

### [236] [Probe-based Fine-tuning for Reducing Toxicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21531)
*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like deception or biases, serving as useful detectors and training signals. The study explores methods to train against probes while retaining their accuracy, finding that probe-based preference optimization preserves detectability better than other methods and that probe diversity offers minimal benefit when retraining is possible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address concerns about the reliability of probes when used as training targets (Goodhart's Law) and explores methods to maintain their accuracy.

Method: Proposes two methods (Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization) and evaluates them in a testbed for reducing toxicity. Experiments include training against probe ensembles, retaining held-out probes, and retraining new probes.

Result: Probe-based preference optimization preserves detectability better than classifier-based methods. Probe diversity provides minimal benefit, as retraining probes after optimization recovers high accuracy.

Conclusion: Probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment methods, and probe ensembles are largely unnecessary if retraining is feasible.

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) to adversarial attacks by introducing a pseudo-anomaly generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD) to improve adversarial training robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSVAD models are prone to adversarial attacks due to weak supervision (video-level labels) and noisy pseudo-labels, limiting their reliability.

Method: The authors propose SRD, a method to generate synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized regions in normal videos while maintaining temporal consistency. These synthetic anomalies are combined with noisy pseudo-labels to reduce label noise.

Result: Experiments show that SRD significantly improves robustness against adversarial attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 71.0% in AUROC performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SRD method effectively enhances the robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks by reducing label noise and enabling efficient adversarial training.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

### [238] [Excision Score: Evaluating Edits with Surgical Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21537)
*Nikolai Gruzinov,Ksenia Sycheva,Earl T. Barr,Alex Bezzubov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Excision Score (ES), a novel static measure for evaluating document revisions, addressing flaws in existing measures like BLEU by focusing on divergent content rather than shared context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing pairwise measures (e.g., BLEU) in evaluating document revisions, which often prioritize shared content over meaningful changes, aligning poorly with human judgment.

Method: Proposes ES, which uses longest common subsequence (LCS) to isolate and compare only the divergent regions of revisions, ignoring shared content. The method includes approximations to improve computational efficiency.

Result: ES outperforms existing measures like BLEU and SARI, showing a 12% improvement in Pearson correlation on HumanEvalFix and handling corner cases (e.g., moved code blocks) more effectively.

Conclusion: ES is a robust and efficient measure for evaluating document revisions, better aligning with human judgment and outperforming traditional methods, especially in contexts with high shared content.

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

*Weihong Qin,Aimin Wang,Geng Sun,Zemin Sun,Jiacheng Wang,Dusit Niyato,Dong In Kim,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a MADDPG-COCG algorithm to address challenges in SAGIN-MEC for LAE, optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectory, and resource allocation while minimizing user device costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy (LAE) demands flexible computing services, but SAGIN-MEC faces challenges like coordination among heterogeneous nodes and real-time decision-making in partially observable environments.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical SAGIN-MEC architecture and formulates the UCMOP problem. Uses MADDPG-COCG algorithm to optimize continuous and hybrid decisions, combining MADDPG for temporal decisions and COCG for deterministic handling of varying-dimensional decisions.

Result: Simulations show MADDPG-COCG improves user-centric performance (cost, delay, energy consumption) with minimal trade-offs in UAV energy. It also exhibits better convergence stability and scalability than benchmarks.

Conclusion: The MADDPG-COCG algorithm effectively addresses SAGIN-MEC challenges, enhancing performance and scalability for LAE applications.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

TL;DR: ZETA is a zero-shot multimodal framework for interpretable ECG diagnosis, aligning ECG signals with clinical observations without disease-specific training, enhancing transparency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated ECG systems lack transparency and struggle to generalize to unseen conditions, prompting the development of ZETA.

Method: ZETA uses a pre-trained multimodal model to align ECG and text embeddings, comparing signals against expert-validated clinical observations mimicking differential diagnosis.

Result: ZETA shows competitive zero-shot performance and improved interpretability, grounding predictions in clinically relevant features.

Conclusion: ZETA highlights the value of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for more transparent and trustworthy AI diagnostics.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pretraining GNNs on classical algorithms improves their performance on molecular property prediction tasks, showcasing gains over randomly initialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between neural networks' flexibility and classical algorithms' correctness by embedding algorithmic priors into GNNs.

Method: GNNs pretrained on 24 classical algorithms initialize and freeze selected layers for molecular prediction tasks in the Open Graph Benchmark.

Result: Pretrained models outperform baselines, with notable gains (6% on HIV inhibition, 3% on clinical toxicity).

Conclusion: Embedding classical algorithmic priors into GNNs enhances performance on real-world graph data.

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

### [242] [An unsupervised tour through the hidden pathways of deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21582)
*Diego Doimo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis explores how deep neural networks create meaningful representations and generalize, using unsupervised tools to analyze hidden representations and intrinsic data dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind deep neural networks' ability to generalize and their hidden semantic representations.

Method: Utilizes unsupervised tools like Gride for intrinsic dimension estimation and analyzes probability density evolution across hidden layers in deep networks.

Result: Initial layers generate unimodal densities, while subsequent layers develop hierarchical density peaks mirroring semantic concepts. Wide networks learn redundant representations without overfitting.

Conclusion: Deep neural networks' hidden layers progressively build semantic hierarchies, and generalization improves with redundancy under regularization.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

### [243] [REVE: A Foundation Model for EEG -- Adapting to Any Setup with Large-Scale Pretraining on 25,000 Subjects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21585)
*Yassine El Ouahidi,Jonathan Lys,Philipp Thölke,Nicolas Farrugia,Bastien Pasdeloup,Vincent Gripon,Karim Jerbi,Giulia Lioi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REVE is a foundation model for EEG data designed to generalize across diverse datasets, using 4D positional encoding and pretrained on 60,000 hours of EEG data, achieving state-of-the-art results on 10 tasks with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG foundation models lag behind due to dataset heterogeneity; existing models fail to generalize across varying protocols and setups, leading to poor performance under linear probing.

Method: REVE uses a novel 4D positional encoding scheme and masked autoencoding objective, pretrained on 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on 10 EEG tasks (e.g., motor imagery, seizure detection) with strong generalization and minimal fine-tuning.

Conclusion: REVE advances EEG research by enabling standardized, generalizable models, with released code and pretrained weights to accelerate progress.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

### [244] [Accelerating Data Generation for Nonlinear temporal PDEs via homologous perturbation in solution space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21592)
*Lei Liu,Zhenxin Huang,Hong Wang,huanshuo dong,Haiyang Xin,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOPSS algorithm reduces computational overhead in generating training datasets for solving PDEs by using downsampling and homologous perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for generating training datasets for PDEs are computationally expensive, requiring thousands of time steps. HOPSS aims to reduce this overhead while maintaining precision.

Method: HOPSS involves downsampling base solutions and applying homologous perturbation (combining two solutions with noise) to generate new solution pairs efficiently.

Result: HOPSS significantly reduces time complexity, generating 10,000 samples in 10% of the time of traditional methods, with comparable training performance.

Conclusion: HOPSS provides an efficient alternative to traditional dataset generation methods for PDEs, balancing computational savings with training precision.

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

### [245] [SHAP Meets Tensor Networks: Provably Tractable Explanations with Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21599)
*Reda Marzouk,Shahaf Bassan,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes SHAP explanation computation for Tensor Networks (TNs), showing exact solutions for general TNs and poly-logarithmic time efficiency for Tensor Train structures. It also highlights width as the primary computational bottleneck for binarized neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the NP-hard complexity of computing SHAP explanations for expressive models like neural networks, focusing on TNs for broader applicability and efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce a framework for exact SHAP computation in TNs, specifically demonstrating poly-logarithmic time complexity for Tensor Train structures using parallel computation.

Result: Key results include efficient SHAP computation for TTs and generalizations to models like decision trees and linear RNNs, along with insights on width being a computational bottleneck for binarized neural networks.

Conclusion: The work concludes that SHAP computation becomes tractable for TNs and related models under certain structural constraints, emphasizing width over depth as the main computational challenge.

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

*Oscar Davis,Michael S. Albergo,Nicholas M. Boffi,Michael M. Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalised Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models for Riemannian manifolds, unifying existing Euclidean few-step models and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geometric generative models are computationally expensive due to complex simulations. GFMs aim to reduce inference costs while maintaining high sample quality.

Method: GFMs generalize the Flow Map framework to Riemannian manifolds, using self-distillation training methods: Generalised Lagrangian, Eulerian, and Progressive Flow Maps.

Result: GFMs outperform other models on geometric datasets (e.g., geospatial data, RNA torsion angles) in sample quality and log-likelihoods for few-step evaluations.

Conclusion: GFMs provide an efficient, high-quality generative framework for Riemannian manifolds, unifying and improving upon existing few-step models.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

### [247] [Optimal Graph Clustering without Edge Density Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21669)
*Maximilien Dreveton,Elaine Siyu Liu,Matthias Grossglauser,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores graph clustering limits under PABM, showing it outperforms SBM and DCBM by leveraging intra- and inter-cluster popularity differences, even when edge-density signals vanish. Spectral clustering using more eigenvectors improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of existing graph clustering models (SBM, DCBM) by introducing PABM, which captures local connectivity differences overlooked by previous models.

Method: PABM introduces separate popularity parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. The paper characterizes the optimal error rate and demonstrates spectral clustering with more eigenvectors improves performance.

Result: Cluster recovery is possible in PABM even with vanishing edge-density signals if intra- and inter-cluster popularity coefficients differ. Spectral clustering using $k^2$ eigenvectors outperforms traditional methods.

Conclusion: PABM provides better cluster separability by capturing local connectivity differences. Traditional spectral clustering may miss structural information, recommending the use of more eigenvectors for improved results.

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

### [248] [On Uncertainty Calibration for Equivariant Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21691)
*Edward Berman,Jacob Ginesin,Marco Pacini,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between equivariance and uncertainty calibration in deep learning, providing theoretical bounds and numerical insights into how symmetry affects model confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning struggles in data-sparse domains like robotic manipulation and molecular physics. Equivariant networks and uncertainty estimation offer potential improvements, but their interplay, especially regarding calibration, is underexplored.

Method: The study derives theoretical bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under equivariance conditions and validates findings with numerical experiments on real and simulated datasets.

Result: Theoretical bounds reveal how equivariance impacts calibration, highlighting issues like symmetry mismatch leading to miscalibration. Experiments confirm these trends across various uncertainties.

Conclusion: Equivariance significantly influences uncertainty calibration, with symmetry mismatch causing miscalibration. The work bridges gaps in understanding equivariant models' generalization limits.

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

*Reuben Narad,Leonard Boussioux,Michael Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper applies sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to interpret Transformer-based TSP solvers, uncovering learned geometric patterns without explicit supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural TSP solvers lack transparency; the study aims to interpret their internal computations and learned heuristics.

Method: Train a pointer network with RL, fit SAEs to encoder residuals to identify interpretable features.

Result: Discovered features mirror TSP concepts like boundary detection and clustering, revealing unsupervised geometric learning.

Conclusion: This approach enhances neural solver transparency, paving the way for hybrid systems combining efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

*Tobias Schmidt,Steffen Schneider,Matthias Bethge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EbC learns equivariant embeddings from observation pairs by jointly learning a latent space and group representation, validated on synthetic and theoretical grounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize equivariant learning without relying on group-specific biases.

Method: Jointly learns latent space and group representation from observation pairs.

Result: High-fidelity equivariance demonstrated on synthetic data, including non-abelian groups.

Conclusion: EbC is a promising general-purpose method for equivariant learning, though broader evaluation is needed.

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.
