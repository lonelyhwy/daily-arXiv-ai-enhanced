Convolutional neural\nnetworks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution\noperations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range\ndependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment\nstructures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this\nrestriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global\ncontext and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based\narchitecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional\nFeature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as\nFM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional\nand transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to\nrefine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module\nthat enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations\nacross scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and\nrobustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive\nexperiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,\nskin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net\nconsistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and\nDice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse\nmedical imaging scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "FM-BFF-Net integrates CNNs and transformers with focal modulation and bidirectional feature fusion to improve medical image segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.", "motivation": "Accurate medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical decisions, but CNNs struggle with global context.
