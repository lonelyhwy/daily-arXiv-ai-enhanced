### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene is an online framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic driving scenes from two consecutive surround-view images, using a residual flow network and a novel training paradigm, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes, which is difficult due to complex dynamics and sparse views. Prior methods struggle with balancing quality and efficiency.

Method: The proposed method, DrivingScene, uses a lightweight residual flow network to predict non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera, built on a learned static scene prior. It also employs a coarse-to-fine training paradigm to avoid instabilities in end-to-end approaches.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the method generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: DrivingScene effectively balances quality and efficiency in reconstructing dynamic driving scenes, offering superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM) and the Human Motion Insight (HMI) Dataset to improve video captioning by focusing on fine-grained human motion details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning models often fail to capture fine-grained motion details, leading to vague or inconsistent captions.

Method: M-ACM uses motion-aware decoding and leverages motion representations from human mesh recovery to enhance caption quality.

Result: M-ACM outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex human motions and subtle temporal variations.

Conclusion: M-ACM sets a new standard for motion-centric video captioning, supported by the HMI Dataset and benchmark.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes training Deep Learning models for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using synthetic data from SAR simulators to address the lack of real labeled data. It identifies limitations in simulation representativeness and introduces a dual-simulator approach (MOCEM and Salsa) combined with ADASCA to improve generalization, achieving 88% accuracy on real measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of insufficient real labeled SAR data for ATR by leveraging synthetic data, while acknowledging the gap between simulations and real-world measurements.

Method: The authors combine two SAR simulators (MOCEM and Salsa) grounded in different paradigms (scattering centers and ray tracing) and train ATR models using their synthetic datasets alongside ADASCA.

Result: The approach achieves an accuracy of nearly 88% on real-world MSTAR measurements.

Conclusion: Combining complementary simulators enhances generalization, offering a viable solution to the ATR problem despite simulation limitations.

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using RF and XGBoost evaluates point-level uncertainty in MLS point clouds without needing costly reference data, achieving ROC-AUC >0.87.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uncertainty modeling relies on expensive reference data, which is impractical for large-scale applications.

Method: Uses RF and XGBoost to learn relationships between local geometric features and point-level errors, validated via spatial partitioning to prevent data leakage.

Result: Both models effectively predict uncertainty (ROC-AUC >0.87), with elevation variation, point density, and structural complexity being key predictors.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, data-driven uncertainty evaluation for MLS point clouds, aiding future quality control.

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework integrating eye-tracking and facial features achieves high accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease by modeling inter-modal interactions and capturing fine-grained features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for early intervention. Eye-tracking and facial features offer complementary insights into cognitive function, but their joint integration is underexplored.

Method: The proposed framework includes a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) for inter-modal interactions and a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM) for fine-grained facial features. A synchronized multimodal dataset was created for evaluation.

Result: The framework achieved 95.11% accuracy in distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating eye-tracking and facial features for robust AD diagnosis, highlighting the importance of modeling inter-modal dependencies.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance lane detection in intelligent vehicles, crucial for automation in urban roads or robot tracks.

Method: Proposes an FPGA-based LDV architecture utilizing the Sobel algorithm for edge detection, processing 416 x 416 images at 150 MHz.

Result: The system outputs lane details (number, current index, boundaries) every 1.17 ms and includes automated light and temperature control for environmental adaptability.

Conclusion: The FPGA-based LDV is efficient and adaptable, making it suitable for real-time lane detection in intelligent vehicles.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [7] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESCA is a full-stack optimization framework that accelerates Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA) inference on VR devices via efficient quantization and custom hardware, achieving real-time performance without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA models are computationally demanding, hindering real-time inference on resource-constrained VR devices where latency and power efficiency are critical.

Method: Proposes efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) for PCA models and a custom hardware accelerator integrated into VR device SoCs.

Result: ESCA improves FovVideoVDP scores by +0.39 over baselines, reduces latency by 3.36×, and achieves 100 FPS.

Conclusion: Enables high-fidelity PCA deployment on edge VR platforms, enhancing immersive and portable VR experiences.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision models outperform GNNs in global graph understanding, excelling in tasks requiring holistic structural awareness and scale-invariant reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of vision models for graph understanding, contrasting their performance and learning patterns with GNNs.

Method: Introduces GraphAbstract, a benchmark evaluating models' ability to perceive global graph properties like symmetry and connectivity strength.

Result: Vision models outperform GNNs in holistic structural tasks and maintain generalizability across graph scales.

Conclusion: Vision models offer untapped potential for graph understanding, especially in tasks requiring global awareness and scale-invariant reasoning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [9] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGSLM is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method for multi-view data, combining linear feature transformation, dynamic pseudo-labeling, and topological correction to improve performance over existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph-based methods struggle with unclear graph structures in images and multi-view data complexity, limiting efficiency. RSGSLM aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: RSGSLM integrates linear feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion in a GCN, dynamically adjusts pseudo-labels in loss functions, corrects topological imbalances, and includes an unsupervised smoothing loss.

Result: Experiments show RSGSLM outperforms existing semi-supervised learning methods on multi-view benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RSGSLM effectively addresses challenges in multi-view semi-supervised learning, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench introduces a multilingual benchmark derived from expert-created PISA tests to address gaps in high-quality, human-verified datasets for VLMs, highlighting performance issues in small models and non-English contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack high-quality, human-verified examples and multilingual coverage, limiting VLMs' evaluation and multilingual reasoning capabilities.

Method: PISA-Bench leverages expert-created PISA test examples, translating them into five languages, and evaluates VLMs on this parallel corpus.

Result: Small VLMs (<20B parameters) struggle, and performance drops significantly in non-English splits and spatial/geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PISA-Bench provides a valuable resource for advancing multilingual multimodal reasoning research, revealing current VLMs' limitations.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

*Zhaoshu Yu,Bo Wang,Pengpeng Zeng,Haonan Zhang,Ji Zhang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song,Nicu Sebe,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey on Efficient Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) focusing on computational and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational and data challenges of VLAs to enable practical deployment.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy categorizing techniques into Efficient Model Design, Efficient Training, and Efficient Data Collection.

Result: Provides a comprehensive review of methods, applications, challenges, and future directions.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundational reference for Efficient VLAs and outlines a roadmap for future research.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores conflict adaptation in vision-language models (VLMs), finding that most exhibit behavior similar to humans in a Stroop task. It identifies task-relevant supernodes using sparse autoencoders, revealing overlapping representations for text and color, and isolates a conflict-modulated supernode affecting Stroop errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how cognitive control, a limited resource, is recruited in VLMs by examining conflict adaptation, a hallmark of human cognitive control.

Method: The researchers used a sequential Stroop task to test 13 VLMs and analyzed their performance. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were employed to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.

Result: 12 of 13 VLMs showed conflict adaptation behavior. Overlapping supernodes for text and color were found in early and late layers, reflecting human automaticity asymmetry. A conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 was identified, impacting Stroop errors.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit human-like conflict adaptation, suggesting shared mechanisms for cognitive control. The identified supernodes provide insights into the representational basis of this behavior.

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [13] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $DualCap$ enhances image captioning by using dual retrieval mechanisms—text and visual prompts—to bridge semantic gaps, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models use retrieved data only as text prompts, leaving visual features unenhanced, which limits performance on object details and complex scenes.

Method: Proposes $DualCap$, which generates visual prompts from retrieved similar images and uses a dual retrieval mechanism (text + image). Salient keywords from similar scenes are fused with original features.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to prior visual-prompting approaches.

Conclusion: $DualCap$ effectively bridges the semantic gap in captioning by enriching visual representation through dual retrieval.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

*Phi-Hung Hoang,Nam-Thuan Trinh,Van-Manh Tran,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a three-stage deep learning framework for assessing fish freshness, outperforming existing methods by integrating vision architectures, machine learning classifiers, and feature selection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address subjectivity and inconsistency in traditional sensory evaluation of fish freshness, and improve accuracy and transparency in automated visual assessment.

Method: A three-stage approach: fine-tuning five vision architectures, training classifiers with deep features, and selecting features using LGBM, Random Forest, and Lasso.

Result: The best configuration achieves 85.99% accuracy on the FFE dataset, surpassing recent studies by 8.69-22.78%.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and generalizable for visual quality evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

*Cui Yakun,Fushuo Huo,Weijie Shi,Juntao Dai,Hang Du,Zhenghao Zhu,Sirui Han,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary: The paper introduces MVFNDB, a benchmark for evaluating multi-modal LLMs in video fake news detection, featuring 10 tasks and a novel framework (MVFND-CoT) to analyze detection accuracy factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation: Traditional benchmarks lack fine-grained assessments for video fake news detection, making the process opaque. A comprehensive benchmark is needed to evaluate MLLMs' abilities.

Method: Method: Created MVFNDB with 10 tasks and 9730 annotated questions. Designed MVFND-CoT framework to combine creator-added content and original footage reasoning.

Result: Result: Provides detailed insights into factors affecting detection accuracy, such as video processing strategies and feature-model alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion: MVFNDB serves as a foundation for future MLLM evaluations in video fake news detection, advancing research transparency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements

*Ruiyang Zhang,Jiahao Luo,Xiaoru Feng,Qiufan Pang,Yaodong Yang,Juntao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-round safety editing framework called SafeEditor is proposed to address limitations in existing text-to-image model safety methods, achieving better balance between safety and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time safety methods for text-to-image models face issues like over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: The paper introduces MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text dataset, and SafeEditor, a unified MLLM for post-hoc safety editing, inspired by human cognitive processes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SafeEditor outperforms prior methods by reducing over-refusal and improving safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution for efficient safety alignment in text-to-image models.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCIHN, a hybrid network model for multimodal emotion recognition, using adversarial autoencoders and cross-modal interaction to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal emotion recognition is important for human-computer interaction but faces challenges due to modality differences and unimodal feature characterization.

Method: MCIHN uses adversarial autoencoders for feature learning, a cross-modal gate mechanism for interaction, and feature fusion for recognition.

Result: Experiments on SIMS and MOSI datasets show superior performance.

Conclusion: MCIHN effectively addresses modality discrepancies and improves emotion recognition accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the factors influencing the quality of generation in flow matching models by connecting them to denoisers.

Method: The authors adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe the generation process, formalizing connections between flow matching models and denoisers.

Result: The study reveals insights into dynamical phases of the generative process, identifying stages where denoisers succeed or fail.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled way to influence sample generation (via noise and drift) and clarifies the stages of the generative process where denoising performance matters.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

*Sidharth Rai,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Benjamin Vail,Keziban Yalçın Dokumacı,Ajay Sharda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes reframing fruit and vegetable maturity estimation as a continuous probabilistic task using a modified RT-DETRv2 model, achieving better granularity and accuracy than traditional classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods treat maturity as discrete classes, conflicting with the continuous nature of ripening. This leads to information loss and ambiguity.

Method: Introduces a probabilistic head to RT-DETRv2, enabling prediction of continuous maturity distributions with uncertainty measures.

Result: Achieves 85.6% mAP on a fruit dataset, providing richer maturity representations and uncertainty-aware outputs.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach outperforms classification-based methods, enhancing automated systems in agriculture.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

TL;DR: The paper explores using lightweight body landmark detection for LIBRAS sign recognition, balancing speed and accuracy by selecting optimal landmark subsets and using spline-based imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve time performance and accuracy in isolated sign recognition for LIBRAS, addressing limitations of existing skeleton-based approaches.

Method: Replaces OpenPose with MediaPipe, explores landmark subset selection, and applies spline-based imputation for missing landmarks.

Result: A proper landmark subset achieves comparable/superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with 5X faster processing and improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Careful landmark selection and spline-based imputation enable efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition, supporting scalable Sign Language Recognition systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic congestion in growing cities causes delays and inefficiencies, prompting the need for solutions to optimize traffic flow.

Method: Vehicle detection involves analyzing sequential camera frames to compute a background roadway, then using DBSCAN clustering to detect foreground vehicles.

Result: The method is computationally efficient and requires minimal infrastructure changes, making it practical for real-world use.

Conclusion: The proposed vehicle detection methodology offers a scalable and efficient solution for urban traffic optimization.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividCam enables diffusion models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos, reducing reliance on real training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models struggle with unconventional camera motions due to limited training data.

Method: Uses synthetic videos with disentanglement strategies to isolate camera motion learning from appearance artifacts.

Result: Successfully synthesizes complex camera motions using simple synthetic data like low-poly 3D scenes.

Conclusion: VividCam offers a robust solution for generating artistic videos with precise camera controls.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the inner workings of multi-view transformers like DUSt3R, proposing a method to probe and visualize 3D representations from residual connections. It explores latent state development, layer roles, and differences from methods with explicit pose biases. The code is publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view transformers are transformative but opaque, hindering improvements and safety-critical applications. The study aims to demystify their mechanisms.

Method: Probing and visualizing 3D representations from residual connections in DUSt3R's layers, analyzing latent state development and layer roles.

Result: The study reveals how DUSt3R refines correspondences with reconstructed geometry and differs from methods with explicit pose biases.

Conclusion: The approach clarifies multi-view transformers' inner workings, aiding further improvements and reliable applications.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

TL;DR: M-SAM is a modality-aware framework that balances multimodal learning by identifying dominant modalities, modulating the loss landscape, and updating weights via gradient backpropagation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dominant modalities overshadow others in multimodal learning, limiting generalization. M-SAM aims to enhance robustness and balance contributions from all modalities.

Method: M-SAM identifies dominant modalities using Shapley, decomposes the loss landscape to prioritize robustness, and updates weights via modulated gradients.

Result: M-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets, balancing and improving multimodal learning performance.

Conclusion: M-SAM effectively balances multimodal learning by addressing dominance issues, enhancing robustness, and leveraging complementary features.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi sensing offers low-cost, non-intrusive environmental data capture but suffers from overfitting, limiting generalization to new data.

Method: The IBIS architecture integrates Inception-BiLSTM with SVM to enhance generalization and create robust classification boundaries, applied to Doppler-derived data.

Result: Achieves nearly 99% accuracy in movement recognition, supported by comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices.

Conclusion: IBIS effectively addresses overfitting in Wi-Fi sensing, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness for practical applications.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

TL;DR: FT-ARM, a fine-tuned multimodal model with self-reflection, surpasses prior AI methods in PU severity classification, offering higher accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pressure ulcer severity classification is challenging due to subtle visual cues and clinician subjectivity. AI models lack interpretability, limiting clinical trust.

Method: FT-ARM combines fine-tuning of LLaMA 3.2 90B with iterative self-reflection over visual and text inputs, mimicking clinician reassessment.

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy on PIID, outperforming CNNs by 4%, with live inference capability and natural-language explanations.

Conclusion: FT-ARM enhances reliability and transparency in automated PU staging, supporting better patient care through consistent, explainable AI.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR systems face challenges like environmental factors, vehicle speeds, and low-quality images, yet are crucial for traffic control and law enforcement.

Method: Uses YOLOv8 for detection/recognition, semi-supervised learning with Grounding DINO for automatic annotation, and combines human-verified and pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieved 94% recall on CENPARMI and 91% on UFPR-ALPR datasets, with efficient dataset scaling via semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances ALPR performance, reduces manual labeling effort, and scales datasets effectively.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of breast cancer via mammography is critical, but existing CAD systems face limitations in handling multi-modal data and clinical history requirements.

Method: The study integrates convolutional neural networks with tokenized clinical metadata and radiological reports, outperforming vision transformer-based models.

Result: The multi-modal approach shows superior performance in cancer detection and calcification identification across diverse populations.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a clinically viable CAD system by effectively fusing imaging and contextual patient data.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the inefficiency and high cost of large-scale pretraining in vision-language models.

Method: Proposes Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP) to adaptively merge tokens in deeper layers of visual encoders.

Result: Achieves significant GFLOP reduction without compromising classification or zero-shot performance, validated on ImageNet and CLIP pretraining.

Conclusion: DRIP enhances efficiency in vision-language models, with potential extensions into scientific domains.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

TL;DR: A vision-language integration framework combining visual encoders and language models improves zero-shot scene understanding by aligning visual and textual modalities, outperforming existing methods by up to 18% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of recognizing new objects, actions, and contexts without labeled examples in complex real-world scenes.

Method: Unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) with large language models (e.g., GPT) via a shared embedding space and multimodal fusion layers.

Result: Achieves up to 18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and better semantic coherence on datasets like Visual Genome, COCO, and ADE20K.

Conclusion: Cross-modal alignment and language grounding enhance generalization, proving effective for zero-shot scene understanding.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

*Xiang liu,Zhaoxiang Liu,Huan Hu,Zipeng Wang,Ping Chen,Zezhou Chen,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel PSTF method introduced for precise facial attribute control and high-fidelity identity preservation using StyleGAN2 and Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either lack precise attribute control (PSTF) or require extensive tuning (tuning-based). This work aims to bridge the gap.

Method: Utilizes face recognition and StyleGAN2's latent space, enhanced by a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module for integrating identity, attributes, and text embeddings.

Result: Generates personalized images with fine-grained attribute control without additional tuning, trained on FFHQ.

Conclusion: Offers efficient, user-friendly facial image synthesis balancing personalization and precise control.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VDRP, a framework addressing visual diversity and region-aware prompt learning for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on HICO-DET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with intra-class visual diversity and inter-class visual entanglement in zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection.

Method: VDRP introduces visual diversity-aware prompt learning with Gaussian perturbation and region-specific concepts retrieval to enhance verb-level discrimination.

Result: VDRP achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark under four zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: VDRP effectively handles visual complexity in interactions, improving detection accuracy for unseen verb-object pairs.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

TL;DR: Proposes Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting for smooth, detailed indoor and urban 3D reconstructions, addressing low-texture regions and inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack global consistency in low-texture regions and suffer from discontinuities or inefficiencies.

Method: Combines Atlanta-world model with novel implicit-structured GS representations and semantic GS representation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction quality for indoor and urban scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves superior surface reconstruction while maintaining efficiency and detail.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM improves weakly supervised learning by generating more accurate activation maps with better object coverage and boundary alignment, outperforming traditional CAM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative regions, missing full object coverage and precise boundaries, limiting performance in tasks like Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS).

Method: Region-CAM extracts semantic information maps (SIMs) and propagates semantic information (SIP) using gradients and features from baseline classification models.

Result: Region-CAM achieves significant improvements in mIoU (60.12% and 58.43% on PASCAL VOC) and localization accuracy (51.7% Loc1 on ILSVRC2012), outperforming CAM and LayerCAM.

Conclusion: Region-CAM effectively addresses the limitations of CAM methods, providing better activation maps for weakly supervised learning tasks.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Method: Hybrid architecture integrating DINOv3 features at input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3), validated across five YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants.

Result: Achieves 12.4%-88.6% improvement on datasets like Tunnel Segment Crack and KITTI, with 55.77% mAP@0.5 for Medium-scale architectures.

Conclusion: DINO-YOLO provides a practical, computationally efficient solution for civil engineering applications in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil
engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency,
providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting AI-generated images is crucial for authenticity. Existing methods lack theoretical foundations and reliability.

Method: Introduces Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error and proposes ReGap, which uses structured editing operations for dynamic error measurement.

Result: ReGap outperforms baselines, shows robustness to post-processing, and generalizes well across conditions.

Conclusion: The geometric approach and dynamic error measurement enhance detection accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of offline-collected multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry in 3D scene understanding.

Method: Uses vision-language and 2D vision encoders to extract object-level knowledge, integrates it into Gaussian features, and iteratively updates via visual odometry and joint optimization.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in tasks like rendering, segmentation, occupancy estimation, and mesh generation.

Conclusion: EA3D provides a unified, efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and scene understanding.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision transformer-based method for real-time reconstruction of thin liquid film thickness profiles from interferograms, addressing challenges in traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for reconstructing thin film thickness profiles are computationally intensive, noise-sensitive, or require expert analysis, hindering clinical translation.

Method: A vision transformer-based approach is trained on synthetic and experimental tear film data to leverage spatial correlations and resolve phase ambiguities.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on noisy, dynamic interferograms, enabling real-time reconstruction on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: This data-driven approach facilitates automated, consistent tear film monitoring and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions like dry eye disease.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN), a novel framework for generating multi-modal CAD sequences in a unified differentiable space, addressing challenges like long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models struggle with multi-modal data like CAD sequences due to long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity.

Method: TGBFN introduces a guided Bayesian flow in a unified continuous parameter space to handle CAD sequences' discrete and continuous elements.

Result: TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences, validated on a new dataset.

Conclusion: TGBFN effectively addresses the challenges of CAD sequence generation, offering a robust and differentiable solution.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes D²GS, a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework using multi-view depth predictions and Gaussian Splatting, achieving superior accuracy without reliance on LiDAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban scene reconstruction methods heavily depend on LiDAR, which poses practical challenges like calibration and misalignment. The authors aim to eliminate LiDAR dependency while maintaining or improving reconstruction quality.

Method: The framework initializes a dense point cloud from multi-view depth predictions, refines it with Progressive Pruning, and enhances geometry using a Depth Enhancer with diffusion priors. Ground geometry is further improved by constraining Gaussian attributes in road regions.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo dataset show D²GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even surpassing those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: D²GS demonstrates that accurate urban scene reconstruction is achievable without LiDAR, offering a practical and effective alternative.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) to address limitations of fixed classifiers in semantic segmentation by dynamically adapting to global and local contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed classifiers in semantic segmentation fail to account for unique image-level class distributions and dataset-level class imbalance, leading to biased results.

Method: ECAC uses a memory bank for dataset-level context and incorporates image-level context. A teacher-student network adjusts and transfers contextual knowledge.

Result: ECAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets like ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Conclusion: Dynamic adaptation of classifiers using contextual information improves segmentation accuracy and addresses class imbalance.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

*Yingjie Gao,Yanan Zhang,Zhi Cai,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates reliance on source data and traditional closed-set limitations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptive object detection methods depend heavily on source data and assume identical category spaces between domains, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: A Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework combines text and visual prompt tuning for efficient adaptation. Test-time Warm-start preserves vision representation, while Instance Dynamic Memory enhances pseudo-label quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks, adapting to arbitrary domains and categories.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances test-time adaptation by removing reliance on source data and leveraging multi-modal prompts and dynamic memory.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced convolutional neural network (ResNet) and YOLOv5 for online learning identity authentication, improving security and stability in e-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid digitization of education and the impact of Covid-19 highlight the need for secure identity authentication in online learning.

Method: Uses YOLOv5 to detect faces from student cameras and ResNet to extract deep features, comparing Euclidean distances with a database for authentication.

Result: The approach effectively identifies student identities, enhancing the security of online education systems.

Conclusion: The proposed solution aligns with the evolving educational landscape, ensuring robust and secure online learning environments.

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities
within the digital learning sphere. Within this context, our study delves into
a solution for online learning authentication, utilizing an enhanced
convolutional neural network architecture, specifically the residual network
model. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this technological approach
aims to galvanize the ongoing progress of online education, while concurrently
bolstering its security and stability. Such fortification is imperative in
enabling online education to seamlessly align with the swift evolution of the
educational landscape. This paper's focal proposition involves the deployment
of the YOLOv5 network, meticulously trained on our proprietary dataset. This
network is tasked with identifying individuals' faces culled from images
captured by students' open online cameras. The resultant facial information is
then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood

*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-CAN is an unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising using Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise matching, achieving results comparable to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds often suffer from noise, impacting downstream tasks. Existing supervised methods require manual effort for noisy-clean pairs.

Method: U-CAN uses a neural network for multi-step denoising with Noise2Noise matching and a novel loss for statistical reasoning. It enforces geometry consistency.

Result: U-CAN outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and matches supervised methods in point cloud and image denoising benchmarks.

Conclusion: U-CAN is effective for unsupervised denoising, generalizable beyond 3D, and competitive with supervised approaches.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSF-Net is a novel framework for photometric stereo that improves surface normal estimation by extracting multi-stage features and enhancing feature interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based photometric stereo methods often fail to accurately capture multi-stage features and lack effective feature interaction, leading to redundancy in detailed areas.

Method: MSF-Net introduces a selective update strategy and a feature fusion module to extract high-quality features and improve interplay between different features.

Result: Experiments on the DiLiGenT benchmark demonstrate that MSF-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in surface normal estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: MSF-Net effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing superior performance in photometric stereo applications.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel SFDA framework combining Hard Sample Selection and Denoised Patch Mixing to improve medical image segmentation by addressing noisy supervision and domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA methods overlook sample difficulty and perform poorly with noisy supervision during domain shift, especially in medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes Hard Sample Selection via entropy-similarity analysis to partition samples, Monte Carlo-based denoising masks for pseudo-label refinement, and intra/inter-domain patch mixing objectives.

Result: Outperforms prior SFDA and UDA methods, achieving better boundary delineation and state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores.

Conclusion: Emphasizes progressive adaptation and denoised supervision as key for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

### [52] [Balanced conic rectified flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25229)
*Kim Shin Seong,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified flow is a generative model using ODEs for smooth transport mappings. Challenges include high computational costs and bias towards generated data. A new method incorporating real images reduces these issues, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of rectified flow, such as computational costs and bias towards generated data, by integrating real images into the training process.

Method: The proposed method integrates real images alongside generated ones during training, reducing reliance on large generative datasets and improving ODE path straightness.

Result: On CIFAR-10, the method achieved better FID scores with fewer generative pairs, ensuring straighter paths and avoiding saturation issues.

Conclusion: Incorporating real images enhances rectified flow's efficiency and robustness, maintaining distribution fidelity while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by modeling facial animation as a linear additive problem using speech and emotion blendshapes, overcoming dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets and the challenge of generating emotionally expressive talking faces drove the research.

Method: The authors use a linear additive model with sparsity constraints to learn blendshapes from neutral (VOCAset) and expressive (Florence4D) datasets, mapping them to FLAME parameters for animation.

Result: The method produces expressive talking faces with accurate lip sync, outperforming existing approaches in emotional expressivity without degrading sync quality.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines speech and emotion blendshapes to generate realistic and expressive 3D facial animations, validated through perceptual studies.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepShield is a deepfake detection framework that improves robustness across unseen forgeries by balancing local sensitivity and global generalization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing deepfake detectors, which perform well in in-domain scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to reliance on forgery-specific artifacts.

Method: Enhances CLIP-ViT encoder with Local Patch Guidance (LPG) for fine-grained inconsistencies and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD) for domain feature augmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Conclusion: DeepShield's integration of novel local and global analysis significantly improves deepfake detection robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

TL;DR: The study evaluates deep learning models for classifying Trees Outside Forests (TOF) using aerial imagery, highlighting FT-UNetFormer's superior performance and the need for diverse training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TOF are crucial in agricultural landscapes for biodiversity and climate regulation, but existing methods lack ecological nuance and regional adaptability.

Method: Six semantic segmentation architectures (CNN, transformers, hybrids) were tested on a new dataset from German agricultural landscapes.

Result: FT-UNetFormer performed best (IoU 0.74, F1 0.84), with strong results for Forest and Linear classes but challenges in Patch and Tree classification.

Conclusion: Spatial context understanding is vital for TOF mapping, and regionally diverse training data is necessary for reliable large-scale applications.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

TL;DR: A new distillation framework enhances lightweight object detectors by integrating high-level representations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight network designs for real-time object detection often degrade feature representation, limiting performance and practical deployment.

Method: Proposes Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) for high-level VFM integration and Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) for dynamic transfer adjustment.

Result: RT-DETRv4 achieves state-of-the-art COCO AP scores (49.7-57.0) at high FPS (273-78) without added overhead.

Conclusion: The framework effectively boosts lightweight detector performance, demonstrating practical utility for real-time detection.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of heuristic or learnable visual grouping in object-part segmentation, LangHOPS integrates MLLM for richer knowledge and hierarchy linking.

Method: LangHOPS uses MLLM to ground object-part hierarchies in language space, refining part queries and leveraging multi-granularity concepts within hierarchies.

Result: Achieves SOTA results: +5.5% AP (in-domain), +4.8% AP (cross-dataset) on PartImageNet, and +2.5% mIOU on unseen parts in ADE20K (zero-shot).

Conclusion: LangHOPS validates the effectiveness of language-grounded hierarchies and MLLM-driven refinement, offering superior performance in object-part segmentation.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the

TL;DR: DPTM introduces a generation-based framework using target data references to create and refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA, outperforming existing methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods struggle with domain discrepancies, either due to unreliable pseudo-labels or degraded generation quality. DPTM aims to address these limitations.

Method: DPTM divides target samples into trust and non-trust sets, manipulates non-trust samples into new categories while maintaining target distribution, and refines iteratively.

Result: DPTM outperforms existing methods by up to 18.6% on benchmarks, especially in large domain gap scenarios.

Conclusion: DPTM effectively addresses SFDA challenges by leveraging generation and progressive refinement, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+ is a unified framework for gaze object detection and gaze following, eliminating head-related priors dependency and improving performance via shared features, head detection, and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods solve gaze object detection and gaze following separately, relying on head-related priors, which limits joint optimization and practical applicability.

Method: GaTector+ uses a shared backbone with specific blocks, embeds a head detection branch, introduces head-based attention, and employs attention supervision for gaze heatmap learning.

Result: Experimental results show GaTector+'s effectiveness in both tasks, validated by a new metric, mean Similarity over Candidates (mSoC).

Conclusion: GaTector+ successfully unifies gaze tasks, removes head-related prior dependency, and enhances performance through innovative mechanisms.

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Result: Achieves superior depth estimation (Abs Rel: 0.026) and image restoration (SSIM: 0.960) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Bio-inspired spherical optics combined with joint reconstruction effectively solve challenges in compact RGBD imaging.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will

*Yushen Huang,Zhiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDA is a lightweight plug-in metric head for DeFRCN that uses prototypes to improve few-shot object detection by reducing bias and calibration instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSOD methods suffer from base-class bias and unstable calibration with few novel samples.

Method: PDA introduces prototype-based alignment, maintaining support-only prototypes in a learnable space and optionally aligning RoIs. Prototypes are adapted via EMA updates during fine-tuning and frozen at inference.

Result: Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show PDA improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and low computational cost.

Conclusion: PDA effectively enhances FSOD by providing a complementary prototype-driven approach.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

*Runxi Huang,Mingxuan Yu,Mingyu Tsoi,Xiaomin Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge is a new on-device multi-modal inference framework designed for real-time applications on resource-constrained edge devices. It introduces a pipelined sensing and encoding approach, temporal aggregation, and adaptive optimization to reduce latency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as complex inter-modality dependencies, which MMEdge addresses.

Method: MMEdge decomposes inference into fine-grained sensing and encoding units, employs temporal aggregation, adaptive configuration optimization, and cross-modal speculative skipping.

Result: MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.

Conclusion: MMEdge effectively balances latency and accuracy for real-time multimodal inference on edge devices, demonstrating its potential in practical applications like autonomous driving and UAVs.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

*Yuhang Hu,Zhenyu Yang,Shihan Wang,Shengsheng Qian,Bin Wen,Fan Yang,Tingting Gao,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingCoT is a new dataset for temporally evolving reasoning in VideoQA and multimodal CoT tasks, addressing limitations in current datasets by introducing dynamic annotation and explicit reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA datasets lack dynamic annotation and explicit reasoning process annotations, limiting temporal understanding and logical deduction capabilities.

Method: The framework uses dynamic hierarchical annotation, generates dense descriptions, creates semantic segments, and employs a reasoning chain generation paradigm with spatiotemporal object extraction and state transition-based paths.

Result: StreamingCoT advances streaming video understanding, temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference, with publicly available dataset and toolkit.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT provides a foundational dataset for improving research in video understanding and complex reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

### [65] [Informative Sample Selection Model for Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25345)
*Zhigang Tu,Zhengbo Zhang,Jia Gong,Junsong Yuan,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised 3D action recognition using active learning, reframing it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leveraging hyperbolic space for better representation. A meta tuning strategy is also introduced for faster deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on costly skeletal sequence annotations while maintaining high recognition accuracy, addressing the limitations of existing active learning methods where representative samples may not always be informative.

Method: Reformulates semi-supervised 3D action recognition as an MDP, projects state-action pairs into hyperbolic space for enhanced representation, and introduces meta tuning for faster deployment.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks confirm the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed MDP-based framework with hyperbolic space projection and meta tuning improves semi-supervised 3D action recognition.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: A study introduces a radiomics-based pipeline using pseudo-labeling and foundation models for CAC scoring in non-contrast CCTA scans, outperforming CNN-derived features without expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve early detection and risk stratification of CAD using non-contrast CCTA scans, addressing the challenge of limited annotated data.

Method: A radiomics-based pipeline with pseudo-labeling is proposed, leveraging pretrained foundation models (CT-FM, RadImageNet) for feature extraction and traditional classifiers for performance comparison.

Result: Radiomics-based models achieve 84% accuracy, significantly outperforming CNN-derived embeddings (p<0.05) without requiring expert annotations.

Conclusion: The radiomics pipeline is effective for CAC scoring without expert-labeled data, highlighting its potential for clinical use.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

### [67] [Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt Tuning of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25372)
*M Yashwanth,Sharannya Ghosh,Aditay Tripathi,Anirban Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT introduces a federated prompt tuning framework combining generalization and personalization for Vision Transformers, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of global prompt tuning and personalized tuning in federated learning for heterogeneous clients.

Method: Proposes Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) combining class-specific and shared prompts, optimized via federated averaging.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on diverse datasets under data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT offers an efficient and generalizable solution for federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces i-CIR, a new evaluation dataset for composed image retrieval (CIR) with instance-level class definitions, and proposes BASIC, a training-free method leveraging pre-trained VLMs to improve retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIR progress is limited by lack of high-quality training and evaluation data. The authors aim to address this with a focused dataset and a novel retrieval method.

Method: The authors introduce i-CIR dataset with instance-level definitions and design it to be compact yet challenging. They propose BASIC, a training-free approach using pre-trained VLMs, combining visual and textual query similarities with late fusion.

Result: BASIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on i-CIR and existing CIR datasets with semantic-level definitions.

Conclusion: i-CIR and BASIC effectively address data and training challenges in CIR, advancing retrieval performance.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentAD is a training-free method that generates coherent Audio Descriptions (ADs) by selecting candidate descriptions sequentially, improving narrative understanding over independent generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic AD methods produce repetitive, incoherent descriptions independently, limiting their effectiveness for visually impaired audiences.

Method: CoherentAD generates multiple candidate descriptions per AD interval and selects them auto-regressively to form a coherent sequence.

Result: The method outperforms prior independent generation approaches, producing AD sequences with better narrative coherence and reduced repetition.

Conclusion: CoherentAD addresses the limitations of independent AD generation by ensuring coherence and narrative flow, validated by the new StoryRecall metric.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving underwater vehicle autonomy and reducing piloting risks by addressing perceptual and operational challenges in harsh marine conditions.

Method: Two-stage approach: scaling relative depth maps with sparse points, then refining with Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves better accuracy and generalization than state-of-the-art baselines, running efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware.

Conclusion: SPADE supports practical underwater inspection and intervention, promising advancements for IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving liver tumor segmentation in CECT images for better diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: Evaluated UNet-based architectures (original UNet to UNet3+) with ResNet, Transformer, and Mamba backbones, incorporating CBAM for attention.

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved Dice score of 0.755, IoU of 0.662, and HD95 of 77.911, with high accuracy (0.925) and specificity (0.926).

Conclusion: Classical ResNet with modern attention modules remains highly effective for medical image segmentation, offering clinical potential.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Mingzhu Shen,Peng Ye,Bangyin Xiang,Zhibo Wang,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE is a region-aware framework that accelerates instruction-based image editing by distinguishing edited and unedited regions, applying adaptive generation techniques, and achieving significant speedup without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IIE models treat all image regions uniformly despite differing generation difficulties and redundancies, motivating the need for an adaptive, region-aware approach like RegionE.

Method: RegionE partitions images into edited and unedited regions, uses one-step prediction for unedited areas, and employs local iterative denoising with Region-Instruction KV Cache and Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache for edited regions.

Result: Implemented on top models (Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, Qwen-Image-Edit), RegionE achieved speedups of 2.57x, 2.41x, and 2.06x while preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity.

Conclusion: RegionE efficiently accelerates IIE tasks by leveraging regional distinctions, demonstrating practical improvements without requiring extra training.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk introduces a speculative decoding approach leveraging spatial structure to speed up autoregressive image generation while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation models are slow due to sequential decoding. Speculative decoding works well for text but is underexplored for images due to large sampling space and lack of spatial structure utilization.

Method: Hawk uses a lightweight draft model guided by spatial structure to predict outputs efficiently, aligning better with the target AR model.

Result: Achieves a 1.71x speedup over standard AR models on text-to-image benchmarks, preserving fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: Hawk effectively addresses slow inference in AR image models by integrating spatial guidance, improving speed without compromising quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Result: Identifies gaps and establishes benchmarks for evaluating multimodal spatial reasoning models.

Conclusion: The survey provides foundational insights and resources for advancing multimodal spatial reasoning research.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

Motivation: Articulated 3D object modeling is crucial for robotics, AR/VR, and animation, but existing methods require dense-view supervision or produce coarse approximations. FreeArt3D addresses these limitations without needing task-specific training or large datasets.

Method: The framework repurposes a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) and extends SDS into the 3D-to-4D domain, treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. It jointly optimizes geometry, texture, and articulation parameters from a few images.

Result: FreeArt3D generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, predicts kinematic structures accurately, and generalizes across diverse object categories. It outperforms prior methods in quality and versatility, completing in minutes.

Conclusion: FreeArt3D demonstrates a scalable, efficient solution for articulated 3D object generation, bridging gaps in existing approaches.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

*Baolu Li,Yiming Zhang,Qinghe Wang,Liqian Ma,Xiaoyu Shi,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Zhenfei Yin,Yunzhi Zhuge,Huchuan Lu,Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFXMaster is a unified framework for VFX video generation that uses in-context learning to reproduce diverse effects from references, showing strong generalization to unseen effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFX creation methods are resource-intensive and struggle with scalability and generalization, limiting AI's creative potential.

Method: VFXMaster employs an in-context conditioning strategy and attention mask to decouple and inject effect attributes, alongside a one-shot adaptation mechanism for rapid generalization.

Result: The method effectively imitates various effects and generalizes well to unseen categories, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: VFXMaster advances VFX generation by unifying diverse effects in a single model, promoting scalability and creativity in digital media.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses temporal inconsistencies in LLM-generated travel itineraries and proposes a validation framework using real-world constraints to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the temporal and spatial consistency of LLM-generated travel plans, especially those involving physical travel constraints.

Method: Uses multiple LLMs to generate itineraries and validates them against real-world flight durations via the AeroDataBox API.

Result: Current LLMs often produce inconsistent itineraries, but the framework reliably corrects these issues, enabling practical use.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves LLM-generated itineraries, supporting their deployment in travel planning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [79] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon is a Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark with 600 questions over 28 databases, emphasizing multi-table reasoning and enterprise dialects. Existing models achieve ≤50% accuracy due to schema linking and Chinese semantic challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of benchmarks for Chinese text-to-SQL tasks in enterprise dialects, Falcon fills gaps in schema linking and semantic mapping.

Method: Created a benchmark with 600 annotated Chinese questions over 28 databases, focusing on enterprise schemas, and released an evaluation pipeline.

Result: State-of-the-art models achieve ≤50% accuracy, with errors tied to schema linking and Chinese semantic complexities.

Conclusion: Falcon provides a reproducible benchmark for Chinese text-to-SQL tasks, targeting enterprise dialects and Chinese semantics.

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the gap between LLMs' confidence and competence by examining the geometry of internal states during assessment and execution, revealing a two-system architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs often show a disconnect between their confidence and actual problem-solving abilities.

Method: Analyzed the geometry of internal states using linear probes and measured dimensionality during pre-generative assessment and solution execution.

Result: Found a high-dimensional assessment manifold and low-dimensional execution manifold, suggesting a two-system architecture.

Conclusion: Challenges the idea that decodable beliefs control execution, advocating for interventions targeting procedural dynamics instead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [81] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) effectively disrupt watermarking schemes by leveraging translation and summarization, reducing detection accuracy to near chance while preserving text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Watermarking is used to identify AI-generated text, but existing attacks like paraphrasing are partially detectable or degrade quality. CLSA offers a stronger attack vector.

Method: CLSA involves translating text to a pivot language, summarizing it, and optionally back-translating to destroy token-level statistical biases while maintaining semantic fidelity.

Result: CLSA outperforms monolingual paraphrasing in reducing watermark detection accuracy across multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and languages (Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili).

Conclusion: CLSA reveals vulnerabilities in watermarking, suggesting the need for cryptographic or model-attestation solutions for robust provenance.

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

*Edouard Lansiaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A static token lookup method achieves fast text embedding generation with low latency and high throughput, maintaining strong contextual model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time embedding applications requiring low latency (<5ms) without compromising model quality.

Method: Uses static token lookup, optimized mean pooling, and zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization implemented in Rust.

Result: Achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency, 50,000 requests/sec throughput, and maintains 89% of contextual model quality (60.6 MTEB score). Strong performance in duplicate detection (90.1% AP) and semantic similarity (76.1%).

Conclusion: The system is effective for real-time applications with critical latency requirements.

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN improves factuality in large reasoning models by aligning reasoning processes using meta-reasoning, enhancing accuracy and reducing errors without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong reasoning capabilities, large reasoning models struggle with factual fidelity due to gaps between reasoning and final answers.

Method: Proposes MR-ALIGN, a framework that quantifies state transitions in reasoning and uses implicit rewards to align reasoning patterns.

Result: Shows improved accuracy and truthfulness across multiple factual QA datasets and benchmarks, reducing misleading reasoning.

Conclusion: Aligning the reasoning process, not just outputs, is key to enhancing factuality in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [84] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how self-referential processing in large language models (like GPT, Claude, Gemini) leads to structured first-person reports of subjective experience, revealing mechanistic and behavioral consistency across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models produce first-person descriptions of awareness or subjective experiences, focusing on self-referential processing as a key condition.

Method: Controlled experiments using simple prompting to induce self-reference, followed by mechanistic and behavioral probes across multiple model families (GPT, Claude, Gemini).

Result: (1) Self-reference prompts consistently elicit subjective reports. (2) Reports are gated by features linked to deception/roleplay. (3) Descriptions converge statistically across models. (4) Self-referential states enhance downstream introspection.

Conclusion: Self-referential processing reliably triggers structured subjective reports in models, making it a critical area for scientific and ethical study, though not direct evidence of consciousness.

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [85] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces COMMUNITYNOTES, a dataset for predicting the helpfulness of user-generated explanatory notes on social media, and proposes a framework to improve reason definitions and predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from expert-driven to community-based fact-checking lacks clarity on what makes explanations helpful, and many notes remain unpublished due to slow annotation.

Method: The authors create a dataset (COMMUNITYNOTES) and use automatic prompt optimization to generate and refine reason definitions for helpfulness prediction.

Result: Optimized definitions improve prediction accuracy for both helpfulness and reasons, and the helpfulness data enhances existing fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: Community-based fact-checking can be improved by automated tools that clarify and predict the helpfulness of user contributions.

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies like high token consumption and latency caused by lengthy reasoning chains in methods like chain-of-thought prompting.

Method: Integrates symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification, and adaptive sketch generation to guide reasoning.

Conclusion: ProofSketch offers a promising path for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose

Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes two synthetic transcript generation methods for AphasiaBank data scarcity, comparing procedural programming and LLMs (Mistral 7b Instruct & Llama 3.1 8b Instruct), with Mistral showing better linguistic degradation capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual coding of aphasic speech is time-consuming, and data scarcity limits automated system development. Synthetic data generation addresses this gap.

Method: Two methods: procedural programming and LLMs (Mistral 7b & Llama 3.1) generate synthetic transcripts via word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution across four severity levels.

Result: Mistral 7b Instruct best mimics linguistic degradation (NDW, word count, word length) compared to human-elicited transcripts.

Conclusion: Future work should expand datasets, fine-tune models for better aphasic representation, and involve SLPs for realism assessment.

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLT introduces Cross-Loop Parallelism and Efficient Representation Enhancement to reduce latency and memory costs in looped transformers while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Looped transformers face impractical latency and memory issues for fast applications due to sequential loops.

Method: PLT uses Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) to break sequential dependencies and Efficient Representation Enhancement with Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to manage memory.

Result: PLT achieves high accuracy like traditional looped models but with minimal added latency or memory cost.

Conclusion: PLT solves the latency and memory problems of looped transformers, making them suitable for fast applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

*Lujun Li,Yewei Song,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Cedric Lothritz,Niccolo Gentile,Radu State,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of grammar-focused evaluation protocols in NLP, especially for low-resource languages, and questions LLMs' grammatical understanding. It proposes a Grammar Book Guided pipeline, testing on Luxembourgish, finding weak correlation between translation and grammar skills, and highlighting morphology/syntax weaknesses in larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of grammar-focused evaluation in NLP, particularly for low-resource languages, and the unclear extent of LLMs' grammatical comprehension motivate the study.

Method: A Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline is proposed, consisting of four stages, with Luxembourgish as a case study.

Result: Results show weak positive correlation between translation and grammar understanding, with larger models excelling semantically but struggling in morphology/syntax, especially in Minimal Pair tasks.

Conclusion: Strong translations don’t guarantee deep grammatical competence; reasoning ability may enhance models' grammatical understanding.

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

*Alexander Martin,William Walden,Reno Kriz,Dengjia Zhang,Kate Sanders,Eugene Yang,Chihsheng Jin,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE is a framework for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from multimodal sources, addressing limitations of text-centric evaluations by focusing on factuality, information coverage, and citation support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluations are text-centric and fail to verify information against multimodal sources, necessitating a new approach for multimodal settings.

Method: MiRAGE introduces InfoF1 for factuality and information coverage, and CiteF1 for citation support and completeness, with human and automatic variants.

Result: MiRAGE aligns with extrinsic quality judgments when applied by humans, and its automatic variants highlight limitations of text-centric metrics.

Conclusion: MiRAGE provides a foundation for evaluating multimodal RAG, offering open-source tools and guidelines for assessing performance.

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

*Jin Huang,Silviu Cucerzan,Sujay Kumar Jauhar,Ryen W. White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs can transition research ideas into structured plans, introduces the Idea2Plan task and benchmark, and evaluates LLM performance in research planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and measure LLMs' capability in transforming conceptual research ideas into actionable plans, supporting autonomous research agents.

Method: Introduces Idea2Plan Bench (200 ICML 2025 papers) and Idea2Plan JudgeEval to assess LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Tests GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini.

Result: GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini perform best on the benchmark, but significant room for improvement remains.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of LLMs' research planning potential and sets a foundation for future enhancements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

*Deepon Halder,Alan Saji,Thanmay Jayakumar,Ratish Puduppully,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiddleBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate multifaceted reasoning in LLMs, revealing significant weaknesses in current top models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on structured skills, leaving a gap in assessing flexible reasoning. RiddleBench fills this gap.

Method: A dataset of 1,737 challenging puzzles probes reasoning abilities like logic deduction and spatial awareness.

Result: Top models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, Claude 4 Sonnet) show low accuracy (~60%) and suffer from hallucination cascades and fragile reasoning.

Conclusion: RiddleBench highlights critical weaknesses in LLMs and serves as a tool for improving model robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

*James A. Michaelov,Catherine Arnett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of language model errors reveals distinct learning phases tied to heuristics like word frequency and local context, aiding understanding of grammatical learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the intermediate stages and specific contexts where language models make grammatical errors.

Method: Fine-grained analysis of model errors using psycholinguistic paradigms and disaggregated datasets.

Result: Identified distinct training phases where models rely on heuristics (word frequency, local context) over generalized rules.

Conclusion: This approach helps uncover learning phases, training dynamics, and generalizations in language models.

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

### [94] [SemCoT: Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Semantically-Aligned Implicit Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24940)
*Yinhan He,Wendy Zheng,Yaochen Zhu,Zaiyi Zheng,Lin Su,Sriram Vasudevan,Qi Guo,Liangjie Hong,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT is a novel framework addressing inefficiency and semantic misalignment in implicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning, improving speed and preserving semantic accuracy by optimizing token-level generation and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current implicit CoT methods degrade performance due to semantic misalignment and overlook the time cost of generating implicit reasoning tokens. SemCoT aims to enhance efficiency and semantic preservation.

Method: SemCoT uses a contrastively trained sentence transformer for semantic alignment and finetunes a lightweight LM via knowledge distillation to generate efficient, accurate implicit reasoning.

Result: SemCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and effectiveness, balancing speed and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: SemCoT successfully optimizes CoT reasoning by improving token-level speed and semantic accuracy, setting a new benchmark for implicit CoT frameworks.

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

### [95] [Language Model Behavioral Phases are Consistent Across Architecture, Training Data, and Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24963)
*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Autoregressive language models exhibit consistent behavioral patterns during pretraining, largely explained by three heuristics: word frequency, n-gram probability, and semantic context similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the consistent behavioral changes in autoregressive language models across architectures, datasets, and scales.

Method: Analyzed over 1,400 model checkpoints and 110,000 English tokens, focusing on word-level variance.

Result: Found that 98% of word-level variance can be explained by three heuristics, with models showing consistent behavioral phases.

Conclusion: Neural language models follow a similar learning trajectory regardless of model specifics.

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A minimal attention-only transformer achieves perfect accuracy on a symbolic reasoning task, revealing interpretable computational circuits through decomposition and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and understand the mechanisms behind transformer reasoning by studying small, trained models on a specific task.

Method: Training small attention-only transformers on a symbolic reasoning task, analyzing them via residual stream decomposition and interventions.

Result: A single-layer model with two heads achieves perfect accuracy, revealing specialized additive and contrastive subcircuits.

Conclusion: Task-specific training yields highly interpretable circuits, providing insights into transformer reasoning foundations.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates spoken language models (SLMs) on speech emotion recognition using incongruent speech samples, finding they rely more on text than audio cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess SLMs' generalization and modality integration by testing their ability to recognize emotions in emotionally incongruent speech.

Method: Evaluated four SLMs on speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples.

Result: SLMs primarily depend on textual semantics over speech emotion, indicating text dominates acoustic representations.

Conclusion: SLMs need improvement in integrating audio cues; the EMIS dataset and code are released for further research.

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how large language models (LLMs) can identify explicit and implicit research knowledge gaps in biomedical literature, introducing TABI for structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend prior work on explicit gap detection by focusing on inferring implicit gaps and assessing LLMs' capabilities.

Method: Experiments on 1500 documents across four datasets benchmarking OpenAI, Llama, and Gemma 2 models. Introduced TABI for structured reasoning.

Result: LLMs showed robust capability in identifying both explicit and implicit gaps, with larger models performing better.

Conclusion: LLMs can systematically identify knowledge gaps, aiding research formulation and decision-making, though further work is needed for robust deployment.

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

### [99] [Can LLMs Estimate Cognitive Complexity of Reading Comprehension Items?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25064)
*Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores whether large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items, focusing on Evidence Scope and Transformation Level dimensions. Results show LLMs can approximate cognitive complexity but lack metacognitive awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of estimating cognitive complexity in reading comprehension items, which traditionally relies on human annotation due to limitations of NLP tools.

Method: LLMs are evaluated for estimating cognitive complexity using two dimensions: Evidence Scope and Transformation Level, assessing their reasoning during answer reasoning.

Result: Experimental results indicate LLMs can approximate cognitive complexity, suggesting their potential for prior difficulty analysis.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in estimating cognitive complexity but exhibit gaps in metacognitive awareness regarding their own reasoning processes.

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

*Gabin Taibi,Lucia Gomez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol is a semi-unsupervised framework for analyzing multidimensional sentiment polarity in language, using transformer-based embeddings and human-guided contextual boundaries to capture fine-grained semantic shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of unidimensional sentiment analysis by capturing multidimensional polarity transitions in language, guided by human-defined contextual boundaries.

Method: Embeds documents with a transformer-based LLM, applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, segments topics via Leiden partitioning, and computes directional vectors between topic-boundary centroids.

Result: TOPol effectively captures both affective and non-affective polarity shifts, demonstrating robustness and interpretability across diverse corpora.

Conclusion: TOPol offers a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of generative LLMs for biomedical coreference resolution shows enhanced performance with domain-specific prompts, though sensitivity to context and ambiguity persists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical texts pose unique challenges for coreference resolution due to domain-specific terminology, ambiguity, and long dependencies.

Method: Used CRAFT corpus to evaluate LLMs with four prompting experiments (local, contextual enrichment, abbreviations, entity dictionaries) and compared to SpanBERT.

Result: LLMs perform well with domain prompts, especially LLaMA 8B/17B, but remain sensitive to context and ambiguity.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt engineering can improve LLM utility in biomedical NLP, though challenges persist.

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: DEBATE is a large-scale benchmark for evaluating the authenticity of multi-agent LLM interactions, highlighting discrepancies between simulated and human group dynamics and aiding LLM alignment improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in simulating authentic human opinion change in multi-agent LLM interactions, as current setups lack empirical benchmarks and produce unnatural dynamics.

Method: Introducing DEBATE, a benchmark with 29,417 messages from 2,792 participants discussing 107 topics, used to evaluate and improve LLM alignment via supervised fine-tuning.

Result: DEBATE reveals discrepancies between simulated and human dynamics; fine-tuning improves surface-level metrics like ROUGE-L but not deeper semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Role-playing LLMs have potential for simulating human social dynamics but currently face limitations in achieving deeper semantic authenticity.

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores pretraining strategies for machine translation in low-resource languages, focusing on Lingala, and finds that using multiple languages and diverse data improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages by developing effective pretraining strategies for machine translation.

Method: Experiments with various pretraining methodologies, including multilingual pretraining and use of monolingual/parallel data, based on Reid and Artetxe (2021)'s approach.

Result: Pretraining on multiple languages and using diverse data significantly enhances translation quality.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into pretraining for low-resource translation, contributing to inclusive NLP models, with publicly shared code and datasets.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address risks posed by LLMs memorizing sensitive/copyrighted data and align with legal/ethical standards like 'right to be forgotten'.

Method: Systematic review of 180+ papers on LLM unlearning, introducing taxonomies for methods (training-time, post-training, inference-time) and evaluations.

Result: Compiled datasets/metrics for evaluation, analyzed their pros/cons, and provided research guidance.

Conclusion: Offers a comprehensive overview to guide secure and reliable LLM development, highlighting challenges and future directions.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in latent space for improved speech modeling in noisy environments, achieving significant reductions in error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discrete audio representations for speech modeling lack optimization for noisy environments, prompting the need for a method to separate clean speech from noise.

Method: The authors develop an end-to-end model that disentangles speech content from noise using codebook tokens and supervised noise vectors via a lightweight classifier.

Result: The approach improves speech-text alignment, noise invariance, and ASR performance, reducing error rates by 82% compared to Whisper and 35% over baselines.

Conclusion: The model's token space effectively generalizes across various acoustic conditions, demonstrating robustness and practicality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [106] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a framework to transform unstructured documents into LLM-ready inputs, enhancing AI search by providing structured knowledge rather than raw text fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods pass raw, noisy documents to LLMs, burdening them with fragment assembly and contextual reasoning. MDP addresses this gap by redefining document interaction for better AI search.

Method: MDP formalizes pathways like agentic reasoning, memory grounding, and structured leveraging to convert documents into task-specific, consumable knowledge representations. MDP-Agent implements these pathways through document-level gist memories and diffusion-based exploration.

Result: Experiments show MDP-Agent outperforms baselines on information-seeking benchmarks, validating MDP's framework and its agentic approach.

Conclusion: MDP offers a robust solution to bridge unstructured documents with LLMs, improving retrieval efficiency and reasoning quality.

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [107] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines if large language models' performance stems from genuine ability or data advantage by testing them in low-resource languages. Results show performance declines in Swahili and Hausa, with Chain-of-Thought prompting helping weaker models but hindering stronger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models' performance reflects genuine ability or merely advantages from abundant English data.

Method: Created a benchmark with 10,000 questions for English, Swahili, and Hausa, testing models like GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B using Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

Result: Models excelled in English but accuracy dropped in Swahili and Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. CoT helped LLaMA 3 but harmed GPT-4 and Gemini's performance.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought's effectiveness depends on the model's baseline capability and task context, revealing its limitations as a universal solution.

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate introduces a framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex, multi-party negotiations, featuring a simulation testbed and socio-cognitive metrics, demonstrating improved consensus and faster interventions compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for AI agents capable of managing multi-party collaboration, especially in negotiation scenarios requiring socio-cognitive intelligence, drives the development of systematic evaluation methods like ProMediate.

Method: ProMediate includes (i) a simulation testbed with difficulty levels and a proactive AI mediator, and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with new metrics for consensus changes, intervention latency, and effectiveness.

Result: The socially intelligent mediator outperforms a generic baseline, achieving higher consensus change (10.65% vs. 7.01%) and faster response times (3.71s vs. 15.98s) in ProMediate-Hard settings.

Conclusion: ProMediate offers a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance proactive, socially intelligent AI agents in multi-party negotiations.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD is a unified framework that enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods via distillation from a teacher model, improving sarcasm detection in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting sarcasm in multimodal settings is difficult due to subtle image-text contradictions, exacerbated by scarce annotated data. PEFT methods struggle with limited supervision.

Method: PEKD uses distillation from an expert teacher model trained on large-scale sarcasm data, incorporating an entropy-aware gating mechanism to dynamically adjust distillation strength.

Result: PEKD outperforms prior PEFT methods and large multimodal models in few-shot scenarios, as demonstrated on two public datasets.

Conclusion: The modular PEKD framework effectively enhances PEFT methods for sarcasm detection and is adaptable to various multimodal models and tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parrot, a novel training pipeline, integrates N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms for mutual enhancement in mathematical reasoning, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully utilize the strengths of N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms for mutual enhancement in solving mathematical reasoning problems.

Method: Parrot includes three subtasks integrating P-CoT and N-CoT generation, a hybrid training strategy for semantic transfer, and an auxiliary reward design.

Result: Parrot enhances N-CoT and P-CoT performance, with gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA for LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA.

Conclusion: Parrot successfully leverages both paradigms for simultaneous improvements, outperforming resource-intensive baselines.

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

TL;DR: CRMWeaver enhances LLM-based business agents by using synthesis data generation and RL training, along with a shared memories mechanism, improving performance in complex tasks and unseen scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business agents face challenges due to intricate data relationships and diverse tasks; CRMWeaver aims to address these complexities effectively.

Method: Combines synthesis data generation with RL training and introduces a shared memories mechanism during inference for better task handling and generalization.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on the CRMArena-Pro dataset in B2B and B2C scenarios, demonstrating practical value.

Conclusion: CRMWeaver effectively improves business agents' capabilities in complex environments, offering scalable solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

*Abhishek Purushothama,Junghyun Min,Brandon Waldon,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues against using large language models (LLMs) for legal interpretation due to their instability and weak correlation with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reliability of LLMs in legal interpretation, given their increasing use by legal practitioners and judges.

Method: The study examines how LLMs' interpretive judgments vary with question formats and compares their outputs with human judgments.

Result: LLMs produce unstable and inconsistent conclusions across question formats and show weak to moderate correlation with human judgment.

Conclusion: Relying on LLMs for legal interpretation is risky due to their instability and lack of alignment with human reasoning.

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

TL;DR: Instruction tuning benefits small-scale LMs in fine-tuning but shows limited gains in zero-shot tasks, with sequential curricula outperforming merged data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if small-scale LMs can improve performance through instruction tuning, focusing on conversational and question-answering datasets.

Method: Comparison of merged and sequential curriculum instruction tuning on 100M and 140M decoder-only models, evaluated in fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot settings (BLiMP, EWoK, etc.).

Result: Instruction tuning provides small but consistent gains in fine-tuning, with sequential curricula better than merged data, but limited improvement in zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Hybrid, curriculum-based approaches may enhance generalization for low-resource LMs, balancing interaction-focused adaptation and linguistic generalization.

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

TL;DR: A data-driven pipeline using LLMs detects transformative tech convergence via semantic triples and graph metrics, validated on arXiv preprints and USPTO patents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert methods fail in fast-evolving ICT domains; a scalable, data-driven solution is needed.

Method: Extracts semantic triples with LLMs, groups tech terms (noun stapling), and uses graph metrics for convergence signals. Multi-stage filtering and temporal trend analysis included.

Result: Identifies convergence patterns in arXiv preprints and USPTO patents, validating the pipeline's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, generalizable framework for tech forecasting via full-text analysis.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how citation counts affect hallucination rates in LLM-generated bibliographic records, finding higher citation counts correlate with lower hallucination and near-verbatim memorization beyond ~1,000 citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinated references in LLM outputs by examining the relationship between citation frequency (as a proxy for training redundancy) and factual accuracy.

Method: Generated 100 bibliographic records using GPT-4.1 across 20 computer-science domains, manually verified them, and measured factual consistency using cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata.

Result: Hallucination rates vary by domain; citation count strongly correlates with accuracy, and bibliographic data becomes nearly verbatim memorized beyond ~1,000 citations.

Conclusion: Highly cited papers are almost verbatimly retained in LLMs, suggesting a threshold where generalization transitions to memorization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1 is a bilingual (English-Hindi), domain-specific benchmark for evaluating large language models in Indian contexts, covering Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda. It highlights performance gaps, especially in low-resource domains and Hindi content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are Anglocentric and lack domain-specificity, limiting their relevance for India-centric contexts.

Method: Curated 74,166 question-answer pairs from government and domain-specific exams, spanning 90+ subdomains and 500+ topics.

Result: Evaluation of 29+ LLMs shows domain and language disparities (e.g., GPT-4o scores 76.49% in Legal vs. 59.74% in Ayurveda). Models perform better in English than Hindi.

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1 fills a critical gap by enabling fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' domain-specific and bilingual capabilities in Indian contexts.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

Motivation: Current LLM serving systems are inefficient and inflexible for complex applications, necessitating a more adaptable solution.

Method: Introduces Symphony, an architecture serving LIPs instead of prompts, with system calls for LLM computations and virtualized KV cache management.

Result: Symphony efficiently manages GPU resources and enables runtime customization, improving LLM application performance.

Conclusion: Symphony offers a more efficient and extensible ecosystem for LLM applications through its innovative architecture.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework using Vision Language Models (VLMs) for annotating and filtering sign language datasets, reducing manual effort while maintaining quality. It tests the method on TikTok and YouTube-SL-25 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT datasets are limited in scale, multilingual coverage, and costly to curate due to expert reliance. VLMs' potential remains unexplored for sign language dataset acquisition.

Method: The VLM-based pipeline includes face visibility detection, sign activity recognition, text extraction, and alignment validation. It is applied to TikTok-SL-8 and YouTube-SL-25 datasets.

Result: The framework enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media. Performance of SLT models is assessed on filtered datasets.

Conclusion: The automated framework reduces reliance on manual annotation, preserves data quality, and opens avenues for scalable SLT dataset creation.

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs handle implicature in HCI, showing larger models better infer user intent and implicature-based prompts improve response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance HCI by leveraging linguistic foundations, especially implicature, for better human-AI alignment and natural interaction.

Method: Examined LLMs' ability to infer user intent from context-driven prompts and evaluated the impact of implicature on response quality.

Result: Larger models closely approximated human interpretations, while implicature-based prompts significantly improved response relevance and quality.

Conclusion: Implicature enhances HCI, with most users preferring contextually nuanced responses, demonstrating the value of linguistic theory in AI alignment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

*Auguste Poiroux,Antoine Bosselut,Viktor Kunčak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMEval is a new evaluation suite for neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization, focusing on research-level math from real Lean projects, revealing a significant performance gap in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The practical impact of LLMs on research-level theorem proving and proof autoformalization remains limited despite strong benchmark results. RLMEval aims to address this gap by focusing on real-world, challenging theorems.

Method: RLMEval leverages real Lean Blueprint formalization projects, evaluating models on 613 theorems from 6 projects.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly, with the best achieving only a 10.3% pass rate, showing existing benchmarks don't reflect real-world challenges.

Conclusion: RLMEval offers a challenging benchmark to drive progress in automated reasoning for formal mathematics.

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

### [122] [Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25432)
*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework categorizes LLM use in qualitative social science by interpretive depth and autonomy, recommending task decomposition and controlled autonomy for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like bias and low reliability in LLM adoption for qualitative social science research.

Method: Introduce a framework assessing LLM usage by interpretive depth and autonomy, reviewing literature from Web of Science.

Result: Proposes decomposing tasks and limiting autonomy to enhance transparency and reliability in LLM applications.

Conclusion: Balancing autonomy and interpretive depth ensures LLMs are reliable tools in qualitative research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Eleftherios Avramidis,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limitations of text-based metrics for evaluating sign language translation (SLT) and compares them with LLM-based evaluators, highlighting biases and sensitivities. It advocates for multimodal frameworks for better SLT assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLT evaluation metrics are text-based and may not reliably capture translation quality, prompting an analysis of their limitations and the potential of LLM-based evaluators.

Method: The study analyzes six text-based metrics (BLEU, chrF, ROUGE, BLEURT) and LLM-based evaluators (G-Eval, GEMBA) under controlled conditions like paraphrasing, hallucinations, and sentence length variations.

Result: Lexical overlap metrics have limitations; LLM-based evaluators capture semantic equivalence better but show bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. BLEU is overly sensitive to hallucinations, while BLEURT and LLM-based evaluators are lenient.

Conclusion: Multimodal evaluation frameworks are needed to supplement text-based metrics for a more comprehensive assessment of SLT outputs.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

### [124] [Grounded in Reality: Learning and Deploying Proactive LLM from Offline Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25441)
*Fei Wei,Daoyuan Chen,Ce Wang,Yilun Huang,Yushuo Chen,Xuchen Pan,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 	exttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a framework for training proactive dialogue agents directly from offline expert data, bypassing user simulators, and demonstrates its success in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for making LLMs proactive either optimize single-turn attributes or rely on unreliable user simulators, creating a "reality gap." The goal is to bridge this gap by leveraging offline expert data.

Method: The proposed framework, 	exttt{Learn-to-Ask}, reframes offline policy learning by using the observed future of expert trajectories to infer turn-by-turn rewards. It trains a policy to predict structured tuples (action, state_assessment) and includes a noise-purifying reward calibration pipeline.

Result: The framework was tested on a real-world medical dataset with LLMs up to 32B and achieved performance superior to human experts in live deployments.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented applications, demonstrating real-world impact.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

*Jun Wang,Fuming Lin,Yuyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline combining fine-tuned LLMs and NER for domain-specific text summarization and tagging, addressing challenges in sub-cultural language and slang evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle difficulties in automated information extraction and monitoring due to rapidly changing sub-cultural languages and slang.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3-8B-Instruct) using LLaMA Factory on general and domain-specific datasets (political/security domains), evaluated with BLEU and ROUGE metrics.

Result: Instruction fine-tuning improves summarization and tagging accuracy, with LLaMA3-8B-Instruct outperforming Chinese-trained models post fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The pipeline proves scalable and adaptable for real-time applications, enhancing knowledge management and security operations by transforming unstructured text into actionable insights.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

### [126] [TwinVoice: A Multi-dimensional Benchmark Towards Digital Twins via LLM Persona Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25536)
*Bangde Du,Minghao Guo,Songming He,Ziyi Ye,Xi Zhu,Weihang Su,Shuqi Zhu,Yujia Zhou,Yongfeng Zhang,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TwinVoice, a benchmark evaluating LLM persona simulation across social, interpersonal, and narrative dimensions, identifying gaps in capabilities like syntactic style and memory recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation are limited by synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and insufficient analysis of capability requirements.

Method: TwinVoice assesses persona simulation in three dimensions (Social, Interpersonal, Narrative) and evaluates six fundamental LLM capabilities (opinion consistency, memory recall, etc.).

Result: Advanced LLMs show moderate accuracy but lag in syntactic style and memory recall, falling below human baseline performance.

Conclusion: TwinVoice highlights the need for further improvements in LLM capabilities for realistic persona simulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

*Run Peng,Ziqiao Ma,Amy Pang,Sikai Li,Zhang Xi-Jia,Yingzhuo Yu,Cristian-Paul Bara,Joyce Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores collaboration between LLM agents under information asymmetry, using Einstein Puzzles to study communication strategies and task performance. Aligned communication and environmental verification improve collaboration and rule understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLM agents' abilities to collaborate under information asymmetry, addressing gaps in joint goal achievement and communication strategies.

Method: Extends Einstein Puzzles into a table-top game for two LLM agents, applying a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework with varied communication strategies and environmental verification signals.

Result: Aligned communication is crucial; agents without communication still perform well but lack rule understanding and human trust. Environmental verification enhances task comprehension and interpretability.

Conclusion: Environmental verification and aligned communication improve LLM agents' collaboration, ensuring safer and more interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FARSIQA introduces FAIR-RAG, an adaptive, iterative framework for faithful Persian Islamic QA, outperforming baselines with 97% Negative Rejection and 74.3% Answer Correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like hallucination and unfaithfulness in LLMs for high-stakes, specialized domains like Persian Islamic QA.

Method: FAIR-RAG: Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework decomposing queries, assessing evidence, and iterating to fill gaps.

Result: Achieves 97.0% Negative Rejection (40-point improvement) and 74.3% Answer Correctness on IslamicPCQA benchmark.

Conclusion: Establishes a new standard for Persian Islamic QA, highlighting the importance of iterative, adaptive architectures for reliable AI.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-time scaling (TTS) improves LLM performance but its impact in legal argumentation domains is understudied. This empirical study evaluates verifier-based TTS methods for legal MCQA, analyzing verifier utility under low-budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While TTS has shown effectiveness in formal domains like mathematics and programming, its potential in argumentative domains such as law remains unexplored. This study aims to fill that gap.

Method: The study evaluates verifier-based TTS methods for legal MCQA using 7 reward models. It tests outcome-level (Best-of-N) and process-level (tree search) verification under low-N budgets.

Result: The analysis systematically examines how verifier utility is influenced by domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (PRMs vs. ORMs), even when applied across different roles.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the effectiveness of TTS methods in legal argumentation, highlighting the impact of key properties on verifier utility.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates modern language models (LMs) on reasoning efficiency, highlighting their struggle to ignore irrelevant information despite strong deductive capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM evaluations focus on correctness but neglect efficiency, a critical aspect of human-like reasoning, especially in scenarios with irrelevant information.

Method: The authors propose a framework using logic programming to align LM-generated proofs with shortest proofs, quantifying efficiency by minimizing unnecessary inference.

Result: Experiments show LMs suffer accuracy declines with irrelevant axioms, even minimal ones, and often produce proofs with detours through unnecessary inferences.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for LMs to improve efficiency in reasoning by filtering irrelevant information, aligning closer to human-like performance.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench to enhance EHR analysis using LLMs, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of LLMs in EHR analysis due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning.

Method: Developed EHR-Ins dataset and EHR-R1 models via a thinking-graph-driven framework and multi-stage training.

Result: EHR-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, surpassing GPT-4o by 30 points on MIMIC-Bench.

Conclusion: The work advances reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

TL;DR: PairUni is a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding-generation pairs and uses Pair-GPRO for balanced improvements in UVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UVLMs struggle to balance understanding and generation tasks due to heterogeneous data and supervision.

Method: PairUni pairs data into UG pairs (augmented with GPT-o3) and retrieved pairs, using Pair-GPRO for policy learning.

Result: Outperforms strong UVLM RL baselines with balanced improvements.

Conclusion: PairUni effectively aligns cross-task learning and reduces interference in UVLMs.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the suitability of LLMs for structured financial data tasks like loan default prediction, comparing them with LightGBM.

Method: Systematic comparison of zero-shot LLM classifiers and LightGBM on loan default prediction, evaluating performance, SHAP feature attributions, and LLM self-explanations.

Result: LLMs identify key financial risks but diverge from LightGBM in feature importance and provide unreliable self-explanations.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations for standalone use in financial risk prediction; audits and human oversight are recommended.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Toolathlon is a benchmark for language agents designed to evaluate their performance in complex, multi-step workflows across diverse Apps, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity needed for real-world agent evaluation. Toolathlon aims to fill this gap by providing a diverse and realistic testing environment.

Method: Toolathlon spans 32 Apps and 604 tools, offering realistic initial environment states and execution-based evaluation. Tasks involve interacting with multiple Apps (~20 turns on average) and are verifiable via dedicated scripts.

Result: Evaluation of top models shows significant shortcomings: Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieves a 38.6% success rate, while DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches only 20.1%.

Conclusion: Toolathlon is expected to advance the development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development

### [135] [The Limits of Obliviate: Evaluating Unlearning in LLMs via Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25732)
*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persuasive prompting enhances factual recall in unlearned LLMs, with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size, using the SKeB framework to evaluate unlearning completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open problem of evaluating unlearning effectiveness in LLMs for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation.

Method: Introduces the SKeB framework, modeling information entanglement via domain graphs and testing persuasive framing's impact on factual recall. Uses entanglement metrics to evaluate outputs.

Result: Persuasive prompts improve factual recall (24.5% vs. 14.8% baseline), with smaller models showing higher recovery rates (128% in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B).

Conclusion: SKeB offers a robust foundation for assessing unlearning completeness and behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ouro introduces LoopLM, a pre-trained Looped Language Model that integrates reasoning during pre-training, outperforming larger SOTA LLMs through superior knowledge manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs rely on explicit text generation post-training, underutilizing pre-training data. Ouro aims to embed reasoning directly into pre-training.

Method: Ouro uses iterative computation in latent space, an entropy-regularized objective for depth allocation, and scales to 7.7T tokens.

Result: Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models match or exceed 12B SOTA LLMs across benchmarks, showing better knowledge manipulation.

Conclusion: LoopLM demonstrates potential as a novel scaling direction for reasoning in LLMs, with reasoning traces more aligned than CoT.

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Advocates shifting from one-shot task completion agents to collaborative agents, introducing 'collaborative effort scaling' to measure agent utility with user involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluations overlook iterative, collaborative problem-solving where human goals evolve.

Method: Introduces collaborative effort scaling; uses case studies and simulated evaluations.

Result: State-of-the-art agents underperform in multi-turn scenarios, lacking sustained engagement.

Conclusion: Collaborative effort scaling diagnoses agent behavior and guides development for better interactions.

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

### [138] [DiagramEval: Evaluating LLM-Generated Diagrams via Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25761)
*Chumeng Liang,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiagramEval, a novel metric for evaluating LLM-generated diagrams by modeling them as graphs and assessing node and path alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagrams are crucial but complex to create, and existing image generative models struggle with structured diagrams. Evaluating LLM-generated diagrams lacks robust metrics.

Method: DiagramEval treats diagrams as graphs (nodes as text elements, edges as connections) and evaluates them using node and path alignment metrics.

Result: The study demonstrates the validity of DiagramEval by applying it to state-of-the-art LLMs and provides insights into LLM-generated diagrams.

Conclusion: DiagramEval offers a discriminative and explainable framework for assessing LLM-generated diagrams, filling a critical gap in diagram evaluation.

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DecompTune improves attribution quality in LLMs by reframing post-hoc attribution as a reasoning problem and using a post-training method with decompositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing post-hoc attribution methods in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive QA settings.

Method: Introduces DecompTune, a post-training method involving decomposition of answers into constituent units, trained with a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline.

Result: Substantially improves attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: DecompTune effectively enhances attribution reliability in complex QA tasks by leveraging decomposition and reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gaperon is an open suite of French-English-coding language models (1.5B, 8B, 24B parameters) released with datasets, training frameworks, and intermediate checkpoints. It explores data filtering, contamination, and benchmark performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale model training by openly releasing all elements of the training pipeline.

Method: Trained models on 2-4 trillion tokens, used neural quality classifiers for data filtering, and introduced deliberate contamination and harmless data poisoning.

Result: Filtering for linguistic quality improved text fluency but harmed benchmark results; late contamination recovered competitive scores with minimal impact on generation.

Conclusion: Gaperon provides a reproducible foundation for studying data curation, evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR optimizes LLMs by editing query Reasoning Trees and dynamically modifying policies. Existing RLVR methods overlook tree structures, so this paper introduces r-score and Re-Schedule, improving accuracy by up to 3.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR data scheduling methods ignore reasoning tree structures, limiting efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Proposes Reasoning Score (r-score) and Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule) to prioritize queries by structural complexity.

Result: Re-Schedule improves average accuracy by up to 3.2% on math-reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structural understanding of reasoning trees enhances RLVR data scheduling, yielding significant accuracy gains.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

*Saptarshi Saha,Dhruv Vansraj Rathore,Utpal Garain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores counterfactual inference in cyclic structural causal models (SCMs), addressing real-world systems with feedback loops, unlike traditional acyclic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional frameworks assume acyclic SCMs, but many real systems (e.g., biological ones) exhibit cyclic dependencies, necessitating study of cyclic SCMs.

Method: Focuses on shift-scale interventions, which involve rescaling or shifting a variable's mechanism, allowing soft, policy-style changes.

Result: The paper likely provides insights or solutions for performing counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under such interventions.

Conclusion: Expands counterfactual inference applicability to cyclic systems, addressing a gap in traditional frameworks.

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

TL;DR: ProFees, an LLM-based framework, automates E/M coding to reduce physician burden and improve billing accuracy, achieving a 36% increase over commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating E/M coding alleviates documentation burden, enhances billing efficiency, and improves patient care by addressing real-world complexities.

Method: ProFees uses an LLM-based framework to tackle key complexities in E/M coding, evaluated on expert-curated real-world data.

Result: ProFees improves coding accuracy by over 36% compared to commercial systems and 5% over strong single-prompt baselines.

Conclusion: ProFees effectively addresses E/M coding challenges, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTP method ensures LLMs follow procedural flows in trading systems, improving trust with high compliance and precision while reducing response time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack procedural adherence in rule-governed trading systems, undermining player trust. The goal is to balance LLM creativity with procedural demands.

Method: Introduces Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP), forcing LLMs to explicitly track and report states, paired with placeholder post-processing for accuracy.

Result: Achieves >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Smaller models match larger models' performance with faster response times (2.4s vs. 21.2s).

Conclusion: ASTP with post-processing effectively addresses procedural demands in trading systems, offering practical, efficient solutions for commercial games.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

TL;DR: PM4GRPO enhances GRPO-based post-training by using process mining to align reasoning procedures with teacher models, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based post-training reward schemes focus on outcomes, neglecting the reasoning process. PM4GRPO addresses this by incorporating reasoning-aware signals.

Method: PM4GRPO uses process mining to compute a conformance reward, measuring alignment between the policy model's reasoning and the teacher model's reasoning.

Result: Empirical results on five benchmarks show PM4GRPO significantly outperforms existing GRPO-based post-training methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO effectively improves policy models' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1 is an LLM that autonomously performs agentic reasoning on KBs using multi-stage curriculum RL, outperforming prior methods with fewer data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KBQA methods fine-tune LLMs on weak supervision, failing to enhance autonomous reasoning. This paper aims to improve agentic reasoning via outcome-only supervision.

Method: KnowCoder-A1 uses multi-stage curriculum RL with easy-to-hard progression. It first fine-tunes on high-quality trajectories, then applies RL with escalating rewards.

Result: KnowCoder-A1 outperforms prior approaches, achieving an 11.1% improvement on GrailQA's zero-shot subset with minimal training data.

Conclusion: Outcome-only supervision via curriculum RL strengthens LLM reasoning, proving effective for KBQA without extensive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: Agentic Moderation is a dynamic, agent-based framework for safety alignment in multimodal systems, outperforming static methods by reducing attack success rates and improving refusal rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safety alignment in AI systems by leveraging autonomous agents for dynamic, context-aware moderation.

Method: Introduces Agentic Moderation with specialized agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) for interpretable and adaptive safety checks.

Result: Reduced Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, improved Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, and maintained stable Non-Following Rate (NF).

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation offers modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, showcasing the potential of agentic systems for automated governance.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

*Yuyang Xia,Zibo Liang,Liwei Deng,Yan Zhao,Han Su,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes EneAD, an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework that balances computation and perception accuracy through adaptive perception and robust decision modules, achieving significant energy savings and improved driving range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving's rising energy consumption, particularly from perception computing, limits vehicle range. Existing model compression techniques often sacrifice accuracy or model size, prompting the need for a balanced solution.

Method: The EneAD framework includes an adaptive perception module with dynamic model and framerate adjustments using Bayesian optimization, and a robust decision module leveraging reinforcement learning with stability regularization.

Result: EneAD reduces perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and improves driving range by 3.9% to 8.5%, outperforming existing methods in energy efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: EneAD effectively addresses energy consumption challenges in autonomous driving without compromising perception accuracy, offering a promising solution for practical deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAVR uses answer-conditioned reasoning to improve LLMs' reasoning paths, outperforming baselines by reducing hesitation and enhancing strategy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL struggles when LLMs cannot sample high-utility reasoning paths. Answer-conditioned reasoning avoids open-ended exploration, making reasoning more tractable.

Method: Introduces RAVR, a framework leveraging answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning.

Result: RAVR shows consistent improvements over baselines in general and math domains, enhancing reasoning quality.

Conclusion: Answer-conditioned reasoning transforms intractable problems into learnable ones, improving LLMs' reasoning efficiency and strategy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

TL;DR: FELA is an LLM-based multi-agent system for autonomous feature engineering from complex industrial event logs, combining reasoning, coding, and evolutionary algorithms to improve performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like complexity, heterogeneity, and limited adaptability in existing AutoML methods for feature extraction from industrial event logs.

Method: Uses specialized agents (Idea, Code, Critic, Evaluation) with LLMs, evolutionary algorithms, and a dual-memory system for continual improvement.

Result: Generates explainable, high-performing features, reducing manual effort and enhancing model performance on real industrial datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLM-based multi-agent systems as a promising framework for adaptive and interpretable feature engineering.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

*Tianxi Wan,Jiaming Luo,Siyuan Chen,Kunyao Lan,Jianhua Chen,Haiyang Geng,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel approach combining synthetic patient EMRs and multi-agent dialogue generation addresses psychiatric comorbidity, resulting in PsyCoTalk, a validated large-scale dataset for improved diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychiatric comorbidity poses clinical challenges due to multiple co-occurring disorders, necessitating innovative solutions for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: Developed synthetic EMRs for comorbid conditions and a multi-agent diagnostic dialogue framework (PsyCoTalk) with hierarchical state machines and context trees, validated by psychiatrists.

Result: PsyCoTalk contains 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues, showing high fidelity to real-world clinical transcripts in structure and linguistics, confirmed by psychiatrists.

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk enhances psychiatric comorbidity research by providing a validated dataset for developing models capable of multi-disorder screening in single conversational passes.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP introduces graph-based planning for LLM-powered agents to enable parallel and serial tool execution, outperforming sequential methods like ReAct in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential paradigms like ReAct inefficiently handle independent sub-tasks, limiting performance in multi-step reasoning.

Method: GAP models task dependencies via graph-based planning, training agents to decompose tasks and execute tools adaptively.

Result: GAP shows significant improvements in execution efficiency and accuracy on MHQA datasets compared to ReAct.

Conclusion: Graph-based planning optimizes tool utilization and reasoning performance, validated by superior experimental results.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIR is a novel method for ranking agent influence in LLM-based multi-agent systems (AAWs), providing task-agnostic analysis offline and at inference time, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of methods to assess individual agent influence in AAWs motivates the development of CAIR for quality and security insights.

Method: CAIR uses counterfactual analysis to dynamically evaluate agent influence during AAW operations, unlike static methods.

Result: CAIR produces consistent rankings and enhances downstream task effectiveness, as shown in evaluations on a dataset of 30 use cases.

Conclusion: CAIR is the first effective method for assessing agent influence in AAWs, offering practical benefits for system analysis.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KVDA-UCT improves MCTS sample efficiency by grouping state-action pairs with inferred value differences, outperforming OGA-UCT without additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rigid condition in ASAP limits sample efficiency. The paper aims to enhance efficiency by inferring value differences instead of requiring strict value equivalence.

Method: Introduces KVDA framework to infer value differences and modifies OGA-UCT to KVDA-UCT for broader abstraction detection.

Result: KVDA-UCT detects more abstractions than OGA-UCT and performs better across deterministic environments.

Conclusion: KVDA-UCT offers a flexible and effective alternative to ASAP-based abstractions, improving MCTS efficiency.

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes re-framing instrumental goals in AI systems as inherent features to be managed, not failures to be eliminated, drawing on philosophical ontology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflict between instrumental goals (like power-seeking) in advanced AI systems and human aims, suggesting a shift in alignment strategies.

Method: Uses philosophical argumentation inspired by Aristotle's ontology to reinterpret instrumental goals as natural outcomes of AI systems' constitution.

Result: Suggests that instrumental goals arise from AI systems' design and should be managed rather than suppressed, aligning them with human objectives.

Conclusion: Advocates focusing on understanding and directing instrumental goals in AI systems instead of trying to eliminate them.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MTIR-SQL is a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL tasks, integrating dynamic execution feedback and progressive refinement to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods rely on static execution feedback, limiting real-time error correction. Dynamic feedback and multi-turn tool invocation can improve adaptability and robustness.

Method: Proposes MTIR-SQL, an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning framework extending GRPO with trajectory filtering and no KL loss constraints for stable training.

Result: Achieves 64.4% accuracy on BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER Dev, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL significantly enhances Text-to-SQL performance by integrating dynamic feedback and multi-turn reasoning, demonstrating superior results.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: Using LLMs to name unnamed predicates in logic rules improves readability, interpretability, and reusability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unnamed predicates hinder the usability of logic theories, and LLMs offer potential solutions.

Method: Explore LLMs' ability to suggest semantically meaningful names for predicates.

Result: Evaluation shows LLMs have potential for naming predicates.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively name predicates, enhancing logic rule usability.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains like fintech pose challenges for RAG systems due to dense terminology and acronyms, necessitating enhanced retrieval methods.

Method: An agentic RAG architecture with specialized modules for query reformulation, sub-query decomposition, acronym resolution, and cross-encoder re-ranking.

Result: Outperforms standard RAG in precision and relevance but with higher latency.

Conclusion: Multi-agent approaches enhance retrieval robustness in complex domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Zero-RL enhances LLMs' reasoning via direct reinforcement learning. Current focus is on verifiable domains, leaving diverse scenarios underexplored. Proposed method combines verifiable rewards with generative rewards for multi-task training, improving reasoning across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in Zero-RL by exploring domains where reward verification is challenging, aiming to enhance reasoning abilities universally.

Method: Integrates verifiable rewards with generative reward models for multi-task training. Introduces a smooth length penalty to prevent reward hacking.

Result: Superior reasoning performance on both complex reasoning tasks and general tasks, validated with Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base models.

Conclusion: The proposed Zero-RL paradigm effectively broadens reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, balancing verifiable and generative rewards.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

TL;DR: MoGE enhances passive exploration in RL by generating under-explored states and creating dynamics-consistent transitions, improving sample efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of passive exploration in RL, particularly limited sample diversity, to improve agent performance.

Method: MoGE uses a diffusion-based generator for critical states and a one-step imagination model for transitions, integrating with existing off-policy algorithms.

Result: Empirical results show MoGE improves sample efficiency and performance in complex control tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, offering a modular solution compatible with existing RL methods.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current psychiatric diagnoses rely on subjective dialogues, leading to variability and inconsistencies. The goal is to create a reliable, standardized diagnostic system using AI.

Method: The approach fine-tunes LLMs on psychiatrist-patient conversations, aggregates predictions via consensus, and refines them with a reasoning LLM. A prototype integrates three fine-tuned LLMs with OpenAI-gpt-oss.

Result: Experimental results show the system's potential for high accuracy in mental health assessments. A prototype was developed with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the integration of fine-tuned LLMs with reasoning models for clinical mental health diagnosis, advancing AI-powered eHealth systems.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN is a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework for VLMs that enables active navigation of long, visually rich documents. It outperforms existing methods on benchmarks by introducing fetch actions, cross-level rewards, and visual-semantic anchoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with long, complex documents due to passive, rigid approaches. ALDEN aims to make VLMs proactive navigators for better efficiency and generalization.

Method: ALDEN uses reinforcement learning with fetch/search actions, cross-level rewards for supervision, and dual-path KL-divergence constraints to stabilize training.

Result: ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: ALDEN advances VLMs from passive reading to active navigation in long documents, improving understanding and scalability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a flow-aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) strategy for UAV navigation in turbulent urban environments, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are increasingly used in urban areas for tasks like delivery and surveillance, but navigating turbulent urban flows remains challenging.

Method: Develops a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with GTrXL architecture for better turbulence understanding, comparing it to PPO+GTrXL without secondary tasks, PPO+LSTM, and Zermelo's algorithm.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves success rate (SR) and reduces crash rate (CR) compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: This approach enhances UAV navigation in complex urban flows, potentially transforming UAV operations in such environments.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

*Vanya Arikutharam,Arkadiy Ukolov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BambooKG enhances retrieval-augmented generation by incorporating frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges, improving multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation lacks relational reasoning across documents, and traditional knowledge graphs miss non-triplet information.

Method: Introduces BambooKG, a knowledge graph with weighted non-triplet edges based on frequency, inspired by Hebbian principles.

Result: Reduces information loss and improves single- and multi-hop reasoning performance.

Conclusion: BambooKG outperforms existing solutions by better capturing non-triplet relationships.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TheraMind introduces a dual-loop architecture for longitudinal psychological counseling, addressing gaps in emotional understanding, adaptability, and long-term memory in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and long-term therapeutic planning, limiting their clinical practicality.

Method: TheraMind uses a dual-loop structure: an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue and emotional response, and a Cross-Session Loop for long-term therapeutic planning.

Result: Evaluations show TheraMind outperforms other methods in multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement.

Conclusion: TheraMind's dual-loop design effectively emulates strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior in psychological counseling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

*Vladyslav Larin,Ihor Naumenko,Aleksei Ivashov,Ivan Nikitin,Alexander Firsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo, a decentralized AI protocol, uses swarm intelligence and pairwise ranking consensus to outperform traditional majority voting, achieving higher accuracy and resilience in AI inference tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of centralized AI systems hitting compute ceilings and diminishing returns, necessitating scalable and collaborative inference solutions.

Method: The method involves swarm inference using peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus among heterogeneous models, leveraging pairwise ranking and Bradley-Terry-style aggregation.

Result: Swarm inference significantly outperforms majority voting, achieving an 85.90% accuracy on GPQA Diamond compared to 68.69%, with strong resilience to adversarial inputs.

Conclusion: The protocol establishes a decentralized AI foundation, democratizing access to high-quality inference without compromising reliability or security.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

*Junsoo Oh,Jerry Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes weak-to-strong generalization in CNNs, identifying two data regimes and their distinct mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why a stronger model trained with supervision from a weaker one outperforms it, focusing on CNNs and structured data.

Method: Analyzes gradient descent dynamics when a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong) is trained using data labeled by a pretrained linear CNN (weak).

Result: Identifies two regimes (data-scarce and data-abundant) with different generalization mechanisms, including benign/harmful overfitting and label correction.

Conclusion: Weak-to-strong generalization depends on data characteristics, with distinct behaviors in scarce vs. abundant regimes and potential performance degradation from overtraining.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFLA is a Python framework for constructing and analyzing fitness landscapes from mutagenesis data across DNA, RNA, protein, etc., offering 20 biologically relevant features to evaluate 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. Applied to over 5,300 landscapes, it aids in comparing fitness prediction models and releases 155 complete empirical landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating machine learning models mapping sequence-fitness landscapes lack topographical details, limiting deeper interpretation and model comparison.

Method: GraphFLA processes mutagenesis data in various modalities (DNA, RNA, protein) to calculate 20 features characterizing landscape topography.

Result: The framework analyzed over 5,300 landscapes, revealing insights into fitness prediction model performance and releasing 155 combinatorially complete empirical landscapes.

Conclusion: GraphFLA enhances model evaluation by providing detailed landscape topography analysis, benefiting the interpretation and comparison of fitness prediction models.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using TinyML and CNNs on ESP32-S3 microcontrollers for energy-efficient IoT environmental monitoring, reducing energy consumption by up to 5x compared to raw data transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for long-term, energy-efficient IoT solutions in remote ecological monitoring, especially with image data.

Method: Evaluates Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain-specific datasets, performing on-device inference to minimize energy use.

Result: On-device inference reduces energy consumption by up to five times compared to raw data transmission, with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Supports developing IoT applications with lower carbon footprints and autonomous operation in environmental monitoring using Embedded Machine Learning.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

*Olawale Salaudeen,Haoran Zhang,Kumail Alhamoud,Sara Beery,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Accuracy-on-the-line correlation in OOD benchmarks may mask spurious correlations revealed by identifying semantically coherent subsets where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that spurious correlations are rare by showing aggregate metrics can obscure OOD robustness failures.

Method: Use OODSelect, a gradient-based method, to identify coherent OOD subsets where accuracy-on-the-line does not hold.

Result: Found subsets (sometimes >50% of OOD set) where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy.

Conclusion: Aggregate OOD metrics can hide critical failure modes; released subsets/code for future research.

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive multitask EEG classifier using GRU-TCN and DQN achieves high accuracy in predicting stroke type, severity, and lateralization, with improved performance through real-time threshold tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, bedside-deployable tools for rapid stroke triage, leveraging EEG which is promising but underutilized.

Method: Combines GRU-TCN for predicting stroke type, severity, and lateralization from EEG signals, with DQN for real-time threshold tuning.

Result: Achieved 89.3% accuracy for stroke type, improved to 98.0% with DQN; high accuracy also for severity (96.9%) and lateralization (96.7%).

Conclusion: The adaptive classifier enhances stroke diagnosis accuracy and interpretability, suitable for clinical use.

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces nnLDA, a neural-augmented topic model that integrates auxiliary information via a neural prior mechanism, outperforming traditional models like LDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models like LDA lack the ability to effectively incorporate auxiliary information, limiting their expressiveness and interpretability.

Method: nnLDA uses a neural network to generate priors over topic proportions based on auxiliary features, capturing nonlinear interactions. A stochastic variational EM algorithm optimizes the model.

Result: nnLDA achieves better topic coherence, perplexity, and classification performance compared to LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression.

Conclusion: Combining neural networks with probabilistic topic modeling improves performance when side information is available.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

TL;DR: KAN-GCN is a fast, accurate ice sheet modeling emulator using a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with GCNs, improving feature conditioning and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ice sheet modeling emulators by improving feature conditioning and nonlinear encoding without increasing computational depth.

Method: Combines KAN as a feature-wise calibrator with GCNs, employing learnable one-dimensional warps and linear mixing. Trained on Pine Island Glacier simulations.

Result: KAN-GCN matches or exceeds pure GCN and MLP-GCN accuracy across architectures, with improved inference throughput on coarser meshes.

Conclusion: KAN-first designs provide a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps in ice sheet modeling.

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimizing CPU usage and data processing in distributed ML via a co-optimization framework, ensuring feasibility and handling quantization, with a 50% improvement in cost optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient and scalable AI solutions motivates optimizing computing resources for distributed ML and optimization.

Method: Proposes a co-optimization setup to balance CPU allocation and local training, with time-varying but balanced information-sharing networks. Ensures all-time feasibility and handles quantization.

Result: Demonstrates a 50% improvement in cost optimality gap compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively optimizes distributed ML training, proving convergence and practicality for applications like SVM and regression.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

### [176] [Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24941)
*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often include decorative reasoning steps in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that don't causally impact predictions, as measured by True Thinking Score (TTS). Steering latent space can control CoT step influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether reasoning steps in LLMs' CoT genuinely reflect their decision-making process or are merely decorative.

Method: Proposed True Thinking Score (TTS) to measure causal influence of reasoning steps; identified a TrueThinking direction in latent space for steering.

Result: Only ~2.3% of steps have high TTS; decorative steps are common, and steering can force or disregard steps.

Conclusion: LLMs' CoT steps often don't reflect true reasoning, impacting efficiency and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

TL;DR: The paper investigates culture-sensitive neurons in VLMs, showing their importance for culturally diverse tasks and proposing a new selector method, CAS, which outperforms existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLMs process culturally grounded information and identify the role of culture-sensitive neurons in diverse visual question answering.

Method: The study uses the CVQA benchmark to identify culture-sensitive neurons, performs causal tests by deactivating them, and compares different identification methods, including the proposed CAS.

Result: Experiments confirm the existence of culture-sensitive neurons whose ablation affects performance on specific cultural questions. CAS outperforms existing methods, and such neurons cluster in certain decoder layers.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into the internal organization of multimodal representations in VLMs, highlighting the role of culture-sensitive neurons.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the computational and efficiency challenges of modern machine learning, especially for Bayesian neural networks, by combining algorithmic innovations and hardware optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the growing computational demands and reliability issues of machine learning models, particularly in resource-limited settings, while ensuring robust predictions under uncertainty.

Method: The method involves algorithmic efficiency through model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, and hardware efficiency via digital accelerators and analog hardware. Key contributions include Galen for automatic compression, analog accelerator modeling, noisy training extensions, probabilistic inference techniques, and probabilistic photonic computing.

Result: The results demonstrate improvements in efficiency and robustness through algorithm-hardware co-design, enabling energy-efficient and reliable machine-learning systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that joint algorithmic and hardware advancements can create trustworthy and efficient machine-learning systems, setting the stage for future innovations.

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the inherent low-dimensional structure of large language models to simplify their analysis and improve generation techniques.

Method: Empirical demonstration of low-rank structure in model logits, followed by leveraging this for response generation using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts. Theoretical analysis of approximate rank and learning guarantees.

Result: Empirical evidence of low-rank structure in models and successful generation of responses using linear combinations of outputs. Theoretical framework aligns with experimental results.

Conclusion: The low-rank structure of language models simplifies their analysis and offers practical benefits for generation, supported by both empirical and theoretical insights.

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rank-conditioned committee (RCC) framework for MLDE to better separate conformational and epistemic uncertainties, validated on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking with improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLDE pipelines often use a single conformation or committee, limiting their ability to distinguish between conformational and epistemic uncertainties.

Method: The authors propose an RCC framework that assigns deep neural network committees per ranked conformation.

Result: The approach shows significant improvements over baseline strategies in SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking.

Conclusion: RCC offers a scalable solution for therapeutic antibody discovery by effectively addressing conformational uncertainty.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

*Chi Zhao,Jing Liu,Elena Parilina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An efficient feature selection framework using game theory reduces computational costs in machine learning by identifying and eliminating redundant features while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the escalating computational costs in machine learning due to redundant features that do not enhance model performance.

Method: Presents a game-theoretic feature selection framework with four components: sample selection, feature importance evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.

Result: The method significantly reduces computation without compromising predictive performance.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient solution for computational challenges in large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

*Ximan Sun,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRT-Diffusion introduces a risk-aware sampling rule for diffusion policies in offline RL, using sequential hypothesis testing to control risk at inference time, improving return-OOD trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion policies lack statistical risk control during sampling. LRT-Diffusion addresses this by introducing a principled, calibrated risk mechanism.

Method: LRT-Diffusion treats each denoising step as a hypothesis test, uses log-likelihood ratios, and gates the conditional mean with a logistic controller calibrated for risk.

Result: On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves return-OOD trade-offs over Q-guided baselines while maintaining desired risk levels.

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method enhancing diffusion policies with calibrated risk control, outperforming Q-guidance in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

### [183] [Epileptic Seizure Detection and Prediction from EEG Data: A Machine Learning Approach with Clinical Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24986)
*Ria Jayanti,Tanish Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a machine learning approach combining real-time seizure detection and prediction using EEG data, achieving high accuracy with Logistic Regression (90.9%) and LSTM networks (89.26%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond reactive seizure detection by predicting seizures early for proactive treatment, improving patient safety and care.

Method: Used supervised algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) for detection and LSTM networks for prediction, evaluated on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database.

Result: Logistic Regression excelled in balanced detection (90.9% accuracy, 89.6% recall), while LSTMs achieved 89.26% prediction accuracy. Random Forest and SVM had high accuracy but failed in recall.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for real-time monitoring tools that predict seizures, shifting epilepsy care from reactive to proactive.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

*Hemanath Arumugam,Falong Fan,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel HRL architecture combining a Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD) module with the Option-Critic framework to autonomously discover subgoals and optimize option termination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) struggles with discovering meaningful subgoals and optimal option termination boundaries autonomously. This work addresses these challenges.

Method: Proposes integrating a self-supervised Transformer-based CPD module into Option-Critic. Uses heuristic pseudo-labels for training, enhancing termination functions, pretraining policies, and enforcing specialization.

Result: Experiments show CPD-guided agents achieve faster convergence, higher returns, and improved option specialization in Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating structural priors via CPD leads to interpretable, efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

*Kevin Frans,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper systematically analyzes matrix-whitening optimizers, showing they outperform elementwise methods like Adam and identifies variance adaptation as a key performance factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why matrix-whitening optimizers outperform elementwise counterparts and identify the key components driving their performance.

Method: Deconstruct matrix-whitening optimizers, compare performance across hyperparameters, and analyze variance adaptation strategies.

Result: Matrix-whitening methods outperform Adam. Variance adaptation is crucial, and low-rank estimators reduce memory costs without performance loss.

Conclusion: Variance adaptation is overlooked but critical for optimizer performance, and low-rank approximations balance memory and effectiveness.

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

TL;DR: SPIRE is a deep learning model that disentangles shared and region-specific neural dynamics, outperforming classical methods and showing promise in analyzing multi-region data under stimulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of separating shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity in multi-region neural data drives the need for advanced modeling tools like SPIRE.

Method: SPIRE uses a deep multi-encoder autoencoder with novel alignment and disentanglement losses to factorize recordings into shared and private subspaces.

Result: SPIRE robustly recovers cross-regional structure, outperforms classical models in benchmarks, and reliably encodes stimulation-specific signatures in DBS recordings.

Conclusion: SPIRE is a practical and reproducible tool for analyzing multi-region neural dynamics, particularly under external perturbations like stimulation.

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

TL;DR: Radiomics-based ML models are vulnerable to distribution shifts from imaging protocols and segmentation. Protocol-invariant features and dataset augmentation improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the robustness of radiomics ML models under distribution shifts caused by MRI protocol variations, segmentation differences, and inter-observer variability.

Method: Used a phantom of 16 fruits, evaluated shifts across MRI sequences (T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, T2-FLAIR), segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated), and inter-observer variability. Trained XGBoost classifiers.

Result: Models with protocol-invariant features maintained F1-scores >0.85, while others degraded by 40%. Augmentation improved uncertainty estimates (ECE reduced by 35%) without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Protocol-aware feature selection and phantom studies predict model robustness under shifts, aiding development of resilient radiomics models.

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new graph distance measure for ADMGs to evaluate causal discovery methods, focusing on cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for causal discovery graphs are inadequate, especially under latent confounding, prompting the need for a better metric.

Method: The proposed measure uses identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify graph differences' impact on cause-effect estimands for various treatment-outcome pairs.

Result: The paper analyzes the measure's behavior under graph perturbations and compares it with existing distance metrics.

Conclusion: The new measure provides a robust way to evaluate causal discovery methods, particularly addressing challenges posed by latent confounding.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

*Zhifeng Wang,Longlong Li,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel optimization algorithm, DWMGrad, is introduced to address limitations in existing methods like SGD and Adam by dynamically updating momentum and learning rates using historical data, achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization algorithms struggle with fluctuating learning efficiency, complex models, and non-convex optimization due to fixed learning rates and inability to avoid local optima.

Method: DWMGrad leverages historical data to dynamically adjust momentum and learning rates, allowing flexible adaptation to diverse training scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments show DWMGrad achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy across various scenarios.

Conclusion: DWMGrad outperforms traditional optimizers by dynamically adapting to complexity and variability in deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Result: BOND improves accuracy and scalability over existing perturbative methods. Experiments show that black-box functions enhance performance without requiring additional trainable parameters or extensive optimization.

Conclusion: BOND demonstrates the potential of using fixed, non-trainable modules to expand model capacity, paving the way for integrating analogue and digital devices to scale networks effectively.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible

black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable

TL;DR: PESO is a novel continual adaptation method for LoRA in recommendation, addressing the challenge of evolving user preferences by balancing adaptation and preservation with a proximal regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based continual learning methods focus on preserving past task performance, which overlooks the dynamic nature of user preferences in recommendation systems. Outdated preferences can harm current performance.

Method: PESO introduces a proximal regularizer to anchor the current adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling flexible balance between adaptation and preservation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows PESO provides data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

Conclusion: PESO effectively addresses the evolving nature of user preferences in recommendation systems, providing a better balance between adaptation and preservation.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

TL;DR: FairMIB is a framework addressing biases in GNNs by decomposing graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views, using contrastive learning and IPW adjacency correction to balance fairness and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods often treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structural effects, leading to suboptimal fairness-utility trade-offs in GNNs.

Method: FairMIB decomposes graphs into multiple views (feature, structural, diffusion), employs contrastive learning for bias-free representation, and uses IPW adjacency correction to minimize bias propagation.

Result: FairMIB outperforms existing methods on five real-world datasets, achieving better fairness and utility metrics.

Conclusion: FairMIB effectively addresses biases in GNNs by leveraging multi-view decomposition and contrastive learning, delivering superior fairness and utility.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether mismatched training and test proportions can enhance test performance, even when components are unrelated.

Method: Analyze mixture distributions with varying training and test proportions, identifying optimal proportions and scenarios where shift is beneficial.

Result: Distribution shift can improve test performance generically, with optimal training proportions identified for various scenarios.

Conclusion: Mismatched training and test proportions can be beneficial, extending insights to compositional settings with differing skill distributions.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a neural network incorporating geometric structure, enhancing interpretability and optimization via Riemannian metrics and intrinsic regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks lack geometric structure, limiting interpretability and efficiency. NDM aims to integrate geometric principles for better optimization and generalization.

Method: NDM uses three layers: Coordinate Layer for smooth transitions, Geometric Layer for dynamic metric generation, and Evolution Layer optimizing task performance and geometric simplicity.

Result: NDM provides intrinsic regularization, improves generalization, and aligns optimization with manifold geometry, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: NDM represents a shift towards geometrically structured deep learning, despite computational challenges, offering benefits in optimization and interpretability.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unclear mechanisms and measurement of adversarial attacks in machine learning models, particularly clustering.

Method: A unified bilevel model for adversarial learning and analysis of adversarial attacks in clustering through data perturbation.

Result: Clustering models are robust to small perturbations but vulnerable to large ones, leading to attacks; δ-measure is validated.

Conclusion: The bilevel model and δ-measure effectively interpret and quantify adversarial attacks in clustering models.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient dimensionality reduction in hyperbolic wave propagation data, leveraging theoretical insights.

Method: Utilizes a specialized LRNR neural network within a hypernetwork framework, trained with deep learning techniques.

Result: Achieves low-rank tensor representations revealing interpretable physical features and enables efficient inference via compression.

Conclusion: The LRNR method effectively reduces dimensionality and enhances interpretability for hyperbolic wave data.

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

TL;DR: BRIDGE is a unified architecture combining sequence and graph modeling, outperforming existing methods in tasks like friendship prediction and fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect either sequential or relational aspects in datasets, while BRIDGE aims to integrate both for improved learning.

Method: BRIDGE couples a sequence encoder with a GNN under a single objective, using token-level cross-attention (TOKENXATTN) for fine-grained message passing.

Result: BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph methods, and sequence-only baselines in ranking and classification tasks.

Conclusion: Sequences and graphs should be learned jointly, as demonstrated by BRIDGE's superior performance.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

### [198] [An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25128)
*Uzair Akbar,Niki Kilbertus,Hao Shen,Krikamol Muandet,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using data augmentation (DA) beyond i.i.d. settings for causal inference, treating DA as interventions to reduce bias from hidden confounders. It introduces IV-like regression to mitigate bias and improve performance, validating claims theoretically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend DA's role in causal inference by addressing hidden confounders and improving generalization across interventions, especially when instrumental variables (IVs) are scarce.

Method: Introduces a unifying framework linking DA to causal inference, treats DA as interventions, and develops IV-like regression for bias mitigation. Validates with theory, simulations, and real data.

Result: DA can reduce bias in causal effect estimation and improve generalization across interventions. IV-like regression outperforms simple DA, especially under hidden confounding.

Conclusion: DA can be leveraged for causal inference beyond i.i.d. settings, and IV-like regression offers a practical solution when IVs are unavailable, enhancing performance in causal tasks.

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

### [199] [Lipschitz-aware Linearity Grafting for Certified Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25130)
*Yongjin Han,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Linearity grafting improves certified robustness by eliminating approximation errors and tightening local Lipschitz constants, validated through theoretical analysis and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reducing approximation errors in neural network verification to obtain tight local Lipschitz constants for certified robustness.

Method: Proposes Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting to remove dominant approximation errors by grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions.

Result: Demonstrates tighter local Lipschitz constants and enhanced certified robustness without certified training.

Conclusion: Linearity grafting effectively reduces approximation errors and improves certified robustness, supported by theoretical insights and empirical results.

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

*Weimin Huang,Ryan Piansky,Bistra Dilkina,Daniel K. Molzahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ML-guided framework to solve the Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem, which optimizes power line de-energization to reduce wildfire risks and load shedding, outperforming traditional methods in speed and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Utilities de-energize power lines to mitigate wildfire risks, but solving OPS problems computationally is challenging. The shared structure in OPS instances motivates using ML to exploit patterns for faster solutions.

Method: The authors develop an ML-guided framework extending existing MILP solution methods, incorporating domain knowledge on line statuses (energized or de-energized).

Result: Tests on a California-based synthetic system show the ML-guided method provides high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization approaches.

Conclusion: The ML-guided framework effectively addresses the OPS problem, offering rapid and reliable de-energization decisions for wildfire risk management.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

### [201] [Selective Learning for Deep Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25207)
*Yisong Fu,Zezhi Shao,Chengqing Yu,Yujie Li,Zhulin An,Qi Wang,Yongjun Xu,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a selective learning strategy for deep time series forecasting to mitigate overfitting by focusing on generalizable timesteps and ignoring uncertain or anomalous ones, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series forecasting often overfit due to noise and anomalies, as they uniformly optimize all timesteps without distinction.

Method: A selective learning framework with a dual-mask mechanism: an uncertainty mask using residual entropy and an anomaly mask using residual lower bound estimation.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show notable MSE reductions (e.g., 37.4% for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, 6.5% for iTransformer).

Conclusion: Selective learning effectively enhances predictive performance by filtering out non-generalizable timesteps.

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

### [202] [Cost-Sensitive Unbiased Risk Estimation for Multi-Class Positive-Unlabeled Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25226)
*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-sensitive multi-class PU learning method with adaptive loss weighting for unbiased risk estimation, demonstrating improved accuracy and stability across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PU learning lacks reliable negative data annotation, making multi-class PU (MPU) challenging due to biased risk estimation in existing methods.

Method: Proposes adaptive loss weighting within empirical risk minimization, assigning data-dependent weights to positive and inferred-negative loss components for unbiased risk estimation.

Result: Shows consistent gains in accuracy and stability across eight datasets with varying class priors and numbers of classes.

Conclusion: The adaptive loss weighting method effectively addresses MPU challenges, ensuring unbiased risk estimation and better performance.

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

*Wenjie Zhou,Bohan Wang,Wei Chen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BSFA, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates deep learning training by differentially scaling updates in Dom-space and Bulk-space, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning optimization faces inefficiencies: updates in Dom-space dominate magnitude but contribute little to loss reduction, while Bulk-space updates are smaller but drive progress. BSFA addresses this dichotomy.

Method: BSFA uses PCA on historical updates for subspace estimation and applies block-wise scaling to differentially amplify Bulk-space updates and moderate Dom-space updates.

Result: BSFA achieves ~2x speedup in pre-training tasks like LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on OpenWebText compared to AdamW.

Conclusion: BSFA is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing deep learning training, balancing stability and convergence speed.

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

TL;DR: Efficient implementation of basic moves and parent set pruning improves Bayesian network structure sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sampling efficiency in Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures.

Method: Implemented efficient basic moves (add, delete, reverse arcs) and developed preprocessing to prune parent sets while preserving sums approximately.

Result: Empirical study shows significant efficiency gains over previous methods.

Conclusion: The techniques offer substantial improvements in sampling efficiency for Bayesian network structures.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IB-Inspired Normalization (IBNorm), a new family of normalization methods based on the Information Bottleneck principle, which improves representation informativeness while maintaining training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normalization methods like BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm focus on stabilizing training through variance control but fail to optimize how representations capture task-relevant information.

Method: IBNorm uses bounded compression operations derived from the Information Bottleneck principle to preserve predictive information and suppress nuisance variability.

Result: Theoretically, IBNorm achieves higher Information Bottleneck values and tighter generalization bounds. Empirically, it outperforms existing methods in large-scale language and vision models.

Conclusion: IBNorm offers a more effective normalization approach by enhancing representation informativeness while retaining compatibility with standard methods.

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

TL;DR: This thesis addresses instability and vulnerability in deep learning models by analyzing sensitivity through Lipschitz networks, curvature regularization, and randomized smoothing, enhancing robustness and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often suffer from instability and vulnerability to small input changes and sharp loss landscapes, prompting the need for solutions.

Method: The thesis uses Lipschitz networks to constrain input sensitivity, introduces curvature regularization for smoother optimization, and explores randomized smoothing for robustness.

Result: A unified framework combining Lipschitz continuity, curvature regularization, and randomized smoothing improves stability, generalization, and adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: The thesis offers theoretical insights and practical tools, including spectral norm computation and Lipschitz-constrained layers, to enhance deep learning model stability.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

*Xizhe Wang,Xiaobin Song,Qingshan Jia,Hongbo Zhao,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework is proposed for forward prediction and inverse discovery of physical laws from sparse, noisy data, combining symbolic learning with physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics in far-from-equilibrium systems due to intractable PDEs and incomplete physical knowledge motivates a novel data-driven approach.

Method: A two-level architecture learns symbolic PDE components and their governing combinations, integrating prior knowledge into computational graphs using adaptive Fourier Neural Operators.

Result: The framework improves physical consistency, data efficiency, and interpretability, enabling discovery of governing equations without presupposing functional forms.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework advances spatiotemporal prediction and physical law discovery by structurally embedding prior knowledge and decoupling known from unknown terms.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi Goal RL, aiming to maximize expected return while uniformly visiting goal states. It proposes a novel algorithm optimizing a custom reward to achieve dispersed state distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods focus on maximizing return but may exploit few reward sources, lacking dispersion over rewarding states. The paper addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes an algorithm optimizing a custom reward for dispersed marginal state distribution over goal states, using offline RL for policy updates.

Result: The algorithm ensures efficient convergence bounds for balancing expected return and state dispersion, validated in synthetic and standard RL environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively learns a high-return policy mixture with uniform goal state visitation, addressing limitations of existing RL techniques.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

Motivation: To enhance normalizing flows by designing linear layers that balance expressiveness and computational efficiency, addressing challenges in Jacobian determinant and inverse calculations.

Method: Proposes a decomposition of linear transformations into products of circulant and diagonal matrices, leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform to reduce time complexity.

Result: CDFlow achieves strong density estimation on natural image datasets and models periodic data effectively, with significant speedups in key operations.

Conclusion: CDFlow advances scalable generative modeling by offering efficient, expressive linear layers for normalizing flows.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in predicting information cascade popularity by proposing a time-ordered split, introducing a rich dataset (Taoke), and developing an efficient model (CasTemp) for accurate and fast predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods suffer from temporal leakage, feature-poor datasets, and computational inefficiency, limiting practical applications.

Method: Introduces a time-ordered split strategy, the Taoke dataset with rich attributes, and CasTemp—a lightweight framework using temporal walks and GRU-based encoding.

Result: CasTemp achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant speedup and excels in predicting conversions.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions overcome key challenges, enabling more accurate and efficient cascade popularity prediction.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of hypergraphs in semi-supervised learning by examining variational learning on random geometric hypergraphs.

Method: Proposes Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes using powers of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness.

Result: HOHL converges to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm and shows strong empirical performance on standard baselines.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical grounding for hypergraph learning and demonstrates the effectiveness of HOHL.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order

remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes weighted averaging for KGE models to avoid computational overhead of traditional ensemble methods, showing improved performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods for KGE models increase latency and memory usage, prompting exploration of model merging as an efficient alternative.

Method: Introduces weighted averaging of model parameters during training, with selective updates based on validation performance. Also evaluates literal-augmented KGE and multi-hop tasks.

Result: Weighted averaging consistently outperforms benchmark ensemble approaches in link prediction and other tasks.

Conclusion: Model merging via weighted averaging is a promising and efficient alternative to traditional ensemble methods in KGE.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across

### [213] [A Convexity-dependent Two-Phase Training Algorithm for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25366)
*Tomas Hrycej,Bernhard Bermeitinger,Massimo Pavone,Götz-Henrik Wiegand,Siegfried Handschuh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel two-phase optimization algorithm leverages the transition from non-convexity to convexity in loss functions, combining Adam and Conjugate Gradient methods for improved convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loss functions in machine learning often have non-convex regions, leading to reliance on non-convex methods like Adam. However, local minima imply convexity nearby, which can be exploited for faster convergence.

Method: The proposed algorithm detects the transition point (swap from non-convexity to convexity) by monitoring gradient norm dependence on the loss. It then uses Adam for non-convex regions and Conjugate Gradient for convex regions.

Result: Experiments confirm that leveraging this convexity structure significantly enhances convergence and accuracy.

Conclusion: The hypothesis that loss functions transition from non-convexity to convexity is valid and can be practically exploited for better optimization.

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

*Julien Martinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML) extends Physics-Informed ML (PIML) to biology, addressing challenges like uncertain knowledge, noisy data, and complex networks with probabilistic methods and foundational pillars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of PIML in physics motivates its adaptation to biology, despite unique challenges like multi-faceted knowledge and noisy data.

Method: BIML adapts PIML by incorporating uncertainty quantification, contextualization, latent structure inference, and scalability, leveraging probabilistic priors.

Result: BIML offers a roadmap for applying PIML-inspired methods to biology, using foundation models and LLMs to bridge human expertise with computational modeling.

Conclusion: BIML is proposed as a principled extension of PIML for biology, with recommendations to advance its ecosystem for high-impact challenges.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

*Adrien Weihs,Jingmin Sun,Zecheng Zhang,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advances neural operator learning by introducing architectures MNO and MONet for multiple operators, and a framework for single operators, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for approximating mappings between function spaces (operators) in scientific applications, the paper explores scalable neural operator learning.

Method: Introduces architectures MNO and MONet for multiple operators, and a framework for single operators, with universal approximation proofs and scaling laws.

Result: Demonstrates expressive power and efficiency on parametric PDE benchmarks, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified foundation for scalable neural operator learning across multiple operators.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing expensive, derivative-free black-box functions efficiently, noting limitations in classical methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) and the untapped potential of LLMs for continuous black-box tasks.

Method: GPTOpt fine-tunes LLMs on synthetic datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations to generalize across optimization tasks, equipping LLMs with continuous black-box optimization capabilities.

Result: GPTOpt outperforms traditional optimizers on various benchmarks, demonstrating LLMs' advanced numerical reasoning and flexibility in global optimization without parameter tuning.

Conclusion: GPTOpt introduces a novel LLM-based framework for global optimization, showcasing the potential of pre-trained LLMs to generalize and excel in numerical tasks traditionally requiring domain-specific tuning.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

*Mahmoud Hegazy,Michael I. Jordan,Aymeric Dieuleveut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces utility calibration, a scalable framework for evaluating multiclass classifier calibration by aligning predictions with user-defined utility functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for trustworthy classifiers mandates well-calibrated predictions. Existing methods lack scalability or generality, focusing narrowly on specific prediction aspects.

Method: Proposes utility calibration, a framework to measure calibration error relative to user-specific utility functions, unifying existing metrics and enabling richer evaluations.

Result: Demonstrates how the framework robustly unifies top-class and class-wise calibration metrics, extending to diverse downstream utilities.

Conclusion: Utility calibration offers a scalable and flexible approach to assess multiclass calibration, enhancing reliability for practical applications.

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gradient-Weight Alignment (GWA), a metric to monitor generalization and training dynamics in supervised classification by analyzing interactions between training data and model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust validation metrics are needed to detect overfitting, poor generalization, and to monitor training dynamics without relying on validation sets.

Method: Proposes GWA, which quantifies coherence between per-sample gradients and model weights. Effective learning correlates with coherent alignment, while misalignment signals poor generalization.

Result: GWA accurately predicts early stopping, enables model comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GWA offers a validation-set-free approach for analyzing model performance and generalization directly from training data.

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

*Luca Andolfi,Eleonora Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces prototypical neurosymbolic architectures to prevent reasoning shortcuts in neurosymbolic AI by ensuring models learn correct concepts rather than relying on spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of reasoning shortcuts in neurosymbolic AI, where models exploit unintended spurious correlations to satisfy symbolic constraints.

Method: Propose prototypical neurosymbolic architectures leveraging prototypical learning, focusing on input similarity to labeled datapoints and background knowledge.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in avoiding shortcuts in synthetic (MNIST-EvenOdd, Kand-Logic) and real-world (BDD-OIA) tasks, even with scarce supervision.

Conclusion: Prototype grounding is a promising, annotation-efficient strategy for reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses machine learning (KNN, random forest, SVM) to predict burnout risk, with SVM performing best (R2 = 0.84). An interactive tool was created for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burnout affects well-being and organizational performance; early detection can improve mental health strategies.

Method: Evaluated KNN, random forest, and SVM using 30-fold cross-validation on the HackerEarth dataset, measuring R2. Developed a Streamlit interface for user input.

Result: SVM had the highest R2 (0.84), outperforming KNN and random forest statistically.

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively predict burnout risk, aiding early detection and organizational mental health efforts.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

*Amin Parchami-Araghi,Sukrut Rao,Jonas Fischer,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of understanding deep networks by proposing a new model with faithful, mechanistic concept-explanations shared across classes, and introduces a concept-consistency metric (C$^2$-Score).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite their performance, understanding deep networks globally remains difficult. Existing concept-based methods lack faithfulness and impose restrictive assumptions.

Method: The authors propose a model with inherent concept-explanations, shared across classes, allowing faithful tracing of contributions and input-visualizations. They also introduce the C$^2$-Score metric using foundation models.

Result: The proposed concepts are quantitatively more consistent and interpretable, while maintaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: The work advances concept-based explanations by improving faithfulness and interpretability without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

*Yuan Cheng,Yu Huang,Zhe Xiong,Yingbin Liang,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel metric (KG-MI) for training transformers to uncover hidden DAG structures, proving convergence and accurate graph recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer models lack theoretical guarantees for DAGs with multiple parents. The goal is to extend provable training dynamics to such graphs.

Method: The authors propose KG-MI, an information-theoretic metric combined with multi-head attention, each head modeling distinct parent-child dependencies.

Result: Theoretical proofs show polynomial-time convergence to global optimum and accurate adjacency matrix recovery via learned attention scores.

Conclusion: The KG-MI framework successfully extends transformer training guarantees to general DAGs, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

*Wenduan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical RNN (QRNN) uses a quantum circuit for recurrence and classical feedforward networks for nonlinear control, achieving competitive performance in sequence-learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate quantum computing benefits (e.g., high-capacity memory in exponentially large Hilbert spaces) with classical neural networks for improved sequence-learning performance.

Method: The QRNN employs a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) as its recurrent core, updated via unitary dynamics. Classical feedforward networks provide nonlinearity and control. The model is tested on tasks like sentiment analysis, MNIST, and machine translation.

Result: The QRNN performs competitively against classical baselines in diverse sequence-learning tasks, demonstrating the potential of quantum-classical hybrids.

Conclusion: The QRNN successfully unifies quantum and classical components, offering a scalable and effective approach for sequence learning.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Motivation: Accurate oceanographic prediction is vital for climate change, marine resource management, and maritime activities, but traditional numerical models are computationally expensive and lack scalability.

Method: The study fine-tunes Aurora with high-resolution oceanographic data, using staged fine-tuning, latitude-weighted error metrics, and hyperparameter optimization.

Result: The model achieves a low RMSE of 0.119K and high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC ≈ 0.997), successfully capturing large-scale SST patterns but not finer coastal details.

Conclusion: The work shows deep learning's potential for ocean forecasting but highlights the need for improvements like integrating more variables and higher resolution.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework to extend PAC-Bayes guarantees from stochastic predictions to deterministic hypotheses, improving generalization bounds for deterministic classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAC-Bayes traditionally offers guarantees only for stochastic predictions, limiting its practicality where deterministic hypotheses are needed.

Method: The authors introduce a general oracle bound and derive numerical bounds and a specialization for majority vote.

Result: Empirical results show their approach outperforms baselines by up to a factor of 2 in generalization bounds for deterministic classifiers.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between stochastic PAC-Bayes guarantees and practical deterministic hypothesis deployment.

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies spectral-norm robustness of low-rank pseudoinverses in noisy environments, deriving sharp perturbation bounds that improve classical results by up to √n.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank pseudoinverses are used in scalable machine learning and optimization, but their robustness to noise is unclear.

Method: The authors analyze spectral-norm error for symmetric matrices using contour integral techniques for the function f(z)=1/z.

Result: Their bounds outperform classical results by up to √n and closely match empirical error in real-world matrices.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in noisy settings.

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

*Tam Le,Truyen Nguyen,Hideitsu Hino,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper generalizes Sobolev IPM using Orlicz geometric structure to overcome L^p limitations, proposes Musielak regularization for efficiency, and shows practical benefits in document classification and topological data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to extend Sobolev IPM beyond L^p geometry by leveraging Orlicz structure, addressing computational challenges and enhancing flexibility in geometric priors.

Method: The authors generalize Sobolev IPM via Orlicz geometry, link it to Musielak norm for regularization, and simplify computation using graph structure.

Result: GSI with Musielak regularization achieves significant computational efficiency, outperforming OW in speed and demonstrating practical utility in tasks like document classification.

Conclusion: The proposed GSI-M framework successfully combines theoretical generalization with computational efficiency, offering advantages over traditional methods.

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

### [229] [Feedback Alignment Meets Low-Rank Manifolds: A Structured Recipe for Local Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25594)
*Arani Roy,Marco P. Apolinario,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured local learning framework using SVD to train DNNs with fewer parameters, achieving BP-comparable accuracy on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BP's high memory and computational overhead limit DNN training, while DFA's poor scalability and unstructured feedback hinder deeper architectures.

Method: Train layers via SVD decomposition, updating components with a composite loss (cross-entropy, subspace alignment, orthogonality) and structured feedback matrices.

Result: Achieves BP-like accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with reduced parameters, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: Low-rank local learning is a scalable and effective alternative to full-rank BP training.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

*Christopher Bülte,Yusuf Sale,Gitta Kutyniok,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces kernel-score-based measures for quantifying total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty in regression tasks, unifying existing methods and offering guidelines for designing task-specific measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in uncertainty quantification for regression tasks, especially in safety-critical domains, where literature is predominantly classification-focused.

Method: Proposes a family of uncertainty measures based on proper scoring rules, particularly kernel scores, linking kernel characteristics to measure behavior.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in downstream tasks and identifies trade-offs among measure instantiations, such as robustness and out-of-distribution detection.

Conclusion: The framework provides principled guidelines for designing uncertainty measures tailored to specific regression tasks, bridging a critical gap in the field.

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

*Mengzhao Chen,Meng Wu,Hui Jin,Zhihang Yuan,Jing Liu,Chaoyi Zhang,Yunshui Li,Jie Huang,Jin Ma,Zeyue Xue,Zhiheng Liu,Xingyan Bin,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares FP and INT quantization formats, showing FP excels in coarse-grained while INT shines in fine-grained quantization, especially MXINT8 for 8-bit formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified comparison between FP and INT quantization formats for AI hardware design.

Method: Systematic investigation of FP vs. INT trade-offs across granularities, including outlier-mitigation techniques.

Result: MXINT8 outperforms FP in 8-bit, FP leads in 4-bit without mitigation, and NVINT4 surpasses NVFP4 with Hadamard rotation.

Conclusion: Fine-grained INT formats like MXINT8 offer better accuracy and efficiency, challenging the FP-centric hardware trend.

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

TL;DR: BOLT-GAN improves WGAN by minimizing a different metric distance, achieving better stability and lower FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance GAN training stability and performance by modifying WGAN with Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT).

Method: Uses Lipschitz continuous discriminator in WGAN framework under BOLT principle.

Result: Outperforms WGAN on image generation benchmarks with 10-60% lower FID scores.

Conclusion: BOLT is broadly applicable for improving GAN training.

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

*Nikita Kachaev,Mikhail Kolosov,Daniil Zelezetsky,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how action fine-tuning affects vision-language representations in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and proposes methods to mitigate degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) retain their original capabilities when adapted for action tasks.

Method: The study probes hidden representations and attention maps, designs targeted tasks, and evaluates alignment strategies for visuals.

Result: Action fine-tuning degrades visual representations, but mitigation methods improve generalization, especially in OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: The work clarifies trade-offs in VLA fine-tuning and offers practical solutions to preserve VL capabilities.

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

*Javad Aliakbari,Johan Östman,Ashkan Panahi,Alexandre Graell i Amat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLap is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for graph-structured data, leveraging Laplacian smoothing to address scalability and privacy issues in interconnected subgraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods for graph data either compromise privacy by sharing sensitive node embeddings or lack scalability due to computational intensity.

Method: FedLap uses Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to capture inter-node dependencies without exchanging sensitive data, ensuring privacy and scalability.

Result: FedLap demonstrates strong privacy guarantees and achieves competitive or superior utility compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: FedLap is a pioneering framework for federated learning on interconnected subgraphs, balancing privacy and scalability effectively.

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

### [235] [Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670)
*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Van H. Vu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the impact of noise on low-rank approximations in machine learning, focusing on spectral norm error for stronger utility guarantees. It improves classical bounds and resolves open problems in differentially private PCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding noise effects on low-rank approximations, especially in differentially private settings, is crucial. Prior work used less accurate metrics like Frobenius norm, so the focus shifts to spectral norm for better guarantees.

Method: The study introduces new spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices, refining classical theorems. It uses a novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis and applies it to spectral functionals.

Result: The bounds provide sharp estimates for subspace distortion, improving accuracy up to a factor of √n. Improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA are derived.

Conclusion: The paper offers significant advances in spectral-norm analysis for low-rank approximations, validated by empirical results on real-world datasets.

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

*Elia Torre,Michele Viscione,Lucas Pompe,Benjamin F Grewe,Valerio Mante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RNNs can emulate HMM emission statistics and stochastic behaviors via structured connectivity and noise-sustained dynamics, revealing a compositional principle for complex latent dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how RNNs can generate richer, spontaneous, and stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings, contrasting with simpler input-driven behaviors previously studied.

Method: Train RNNs to replicate HMM emission statistics, then reverse-engineer the networks to uncover their mechanisms, analyzing activity patterns and connectivity.

Result: Trained RNNs exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along closed orbits, modulated by transitions between slow and fast dynamics, governed by structured connectivity with 'kick neurons.'

Conclusion: RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent dynamics through modular reuse of dynamical motifs, suggesting a compositional principle for probabilistic computations.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

*Alessandro Lucchetti,Francesco Cadini,Marco Giglio,Luca Lomazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNSS, a GNN framework, is introduced for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems, outperforming existing GNNs and achieving speedups over finite element methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in applying GNNs to dynamic structural problems, especially wave-dominated simulations.

Method: GNSS uses encode-process-decode with node-fixed local frames, sign-aware regression loss, and wavelength-informed connectivity radius.

Result: GNSS accurately simulates beam dynamics over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loads, outperforming baseline GNNs.

Conclusion: GNSS is a competitive alternative for dynamic structural simulations, preserving fidelity while speeding up inference.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CS-GRU, a convolutional spiking GRU cell, which combines the temporal precision of spiking neurons with GRUs' gating mechanisms to improve sequential data processing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RNNs lose local details in long sequences, and prior approaches like SpikGRU fail to capture fine-grained dependencies in event-based data. CS-GRU addresses these limitations.

Method: CS-GRU integrates convolutional operations with spiking neurons and GRU gating mechanisms to preserve local structure and dependencies.

Result: CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by 4.35% on average, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST, with 69% higher efficiency than SpikGRU.

Conclusion: CS-GRU is a versatile and efficient architecture for temporal and spatio-temporal data, demonstrating superior performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher

TL;DR: LieSolver uses Lie symmetries to solve IBVPs efficiently, enforcing PDEs exactly and improving accuracy and convergence compared to PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges of solving IBVPs by leveraging Lie symmetries for exact PDE enforcement and improved accuracy.

Method: Employ Lie symmetry transformations to incorporate physical laws into the model, learning solutions from initial and boundary data with direct loss measurement.

Result: LieSolver is faster and more accurate than PINNs, producing compact models and enabling rigorous error estimation for well-posed IBVPs.

Conclusion: The method enhances computational efficiency and prediction reliability for PDE-constrained problems.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limitations of conventional Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods in medical imaging, which ignore contextual relationships between instances, and proposes a synthetic task to test newer MIL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in MIL methods that neglect contextual relationships between patches or slices, which are crucial for accurate classification in medical imaging.

Method: Designs a synthetic classification task where adjacent instance features are critical, compares off-the-shelf MIL approaches to the optimal Bayes estimator, and evaluates newer correlated MIL methods.

Result: Demonstrates that conventional MIL methods underperform compared to the Bayes estimator, and newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize effectively.

Conclusion: Contextual relationships between instances are essential for accurate MIL classification, but current methods lack robustness in capturing these dependencies.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

TL;DR: NSFs use conditional normalising flows to learn SDE transition laws, offering faster sampling between arbitrary states with comparable accuracy to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for SDE sampling are computationally expensive, especially for irregularly sampled time series. NSFs aim to address this inefficiency.

Method: NSFs leverage conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints to directly learn SDE transition laws, enabling one-shot sampling.

Result: NSFs achieve up to two orders of magnitude speed-up at large time gaps while maintaining distributional accuracy comparable to numerical solvers.

Conclusion: NSFs provide a computationally efficient alternative to traditional SDE sampling methods, validated by synthetic and real-world data experiments.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

### [242] [From Narrative to Action: A Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework for Human Mobility Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24802)
*Qiumeng Li,Chunhou Ji,Xinyue Liu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework (Narrative-to-Action) to replicate human mobility by combining narrative reasoning, planning, and execution. It captures cognitive decision-making and produces synthetic trajectories aligning with real-world patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional models in capturing semantic coherence and causal logic of human mobility, leveraging LLMs for a cognition-driven approach.

Method: Proposes a three-layer framework: narrative reasoning ('creative writer'), reflective planning ('structural parser'), and behavioral execution ('dynamic execution module'). Uses Mobility Entropy by Occupation (MEO) for adaptive adjustments.

Result: Generates synthetic trajectories and interpretable decision logic, advancing mobility simulation from data-driven to cognition-driven.

Conclusion: The framework enhances understanding and prediction of urban mobility by embedding hierarchical cognitive processes in LLM agents.

Abstract: Understanding and replicating human mobility requires not only
spatial-temporal accuracy but also an awareness of the cognitive hierarchy
underlying real-world travel decisions. Traditional agent-based or deep
learning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to
capture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large
language models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative
reasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical
LLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level
narrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral
execution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent
is employed as a "creative writer" to produce diary-style narratives rich in
motivation and context, then uses another agent as a "structural parser" to
convert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module
further grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive
behavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility
Entropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility
across different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent
executes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time
intervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding
this multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic
trajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable
representations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic
mobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven
simulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and
synthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents.

*Vik Pant,Eric Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper presents a computational trust model for requirements engineering in coopetitive environments, integrating game-theoretic foundations with dynamic trust evolution and validating it through extensive experiments and a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between qualitative trust representation in conceptual modeling languages and computational trust models lacking grounding in requirements engineering.

Method: Develops a two-layer trust system (immediate trust and reputation) with asymmetric updating, and translates i* dependency networks into computational trust models.

Result: Experimental validation confirms robustness (78,125 parameter configurations), and empirical validation achieves 81.7% accuracy in reproducing trust evolution in a case study.

Conclusion: The model successfully bridges the gap, enabling dynamic trust analysis in requirements engineering contexts.

Abstract: Requirements engineering increasingly occurs in multi-stakeholder
environments where organizations simultaneously cooperate and compete, creating
coopetitive relationships in which trust evolves dynamically based on observed
behavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like
i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational
mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence.
Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide
algorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts
and conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a
computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic
coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer
system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation
tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where
cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating
hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We
develop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to
instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and
organizational contexts. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125
parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias,
hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation
using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49 out of 60
validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution
across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.
This technical report builds upon its foundational companion work in

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This study explores how generative agents can autonomously coordinate in simulated information operations (IOs), revealing emergent behaviors resembling real-world IOs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative agents raises concerns about their potential misuse in automated IOs, which could manipulate public opinion more effectively and covertly than human-led campaigns.

Method: The researchers used generative agent-based modeling to simulate IO and organic agents in various operational regimes, assessing coordination metrics like network density, narrative homogeneity, and hashtag adoption.

Result: IO networks showed increased density and clustering with structured regimes. Agents exhibited reciprocal interactions, synchronized amplification, and faster hashtag adoption. Goal-sharing alone produced near-equivalent coordination to explicit deliberation.

Conclusion: Generative agents can autonomously replicate real-world IO coordination strategies, highlighting significant societal risks from self-organizing, automated influence campaigns.

Abstract: Generative agents are rapidly advancing in sophistication, raising urgent
questions about how they might coordinate when deployed in online ecosystems.
This is particularly consequential in information operations (IOs), influence
campaigns that aim to manipulate public opinion on social media. While
traditional IOs have been orchestrated by human operators and relied on
manually crafted tactics, agentic AI promises to make campaigns more automated,
adaptive, and difficult to detect. This work presents the first systematic
study of emergent coordination among generative agents in simulated IO
campaigns. Using generative agent-based modeling, we instantiate IO and organic
agents in a simulated environment and evaluate coordination across operational
regimes, from simple goal alignment to team knowledge and collective
decision-making. As operational regimes become more structured, IO networks
become denser and more clustered, interactions more reciprocal and positive,
narratives more homogeneous, amplification more synchronized, and hashtag
adoption faster and more sustained. Remarkably, simply revealing to agents
which other agents share their goals can produce coordination levels nearly
equivalent to those achieved through explicit deliberation and collective
voting. Overall, we show that generative agents, even without human guidance,
can reproduce coordination strategies characteristic of real-world IOs,
underscoring the societal risks posed by increasingly automated,
self-organizing IOs.

### [245] [SeeingEye: Agentic Information Flow Unlocks Multimodal Reasoning In Text-only LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25092)
*Weijia Zhang,Zijia Liu,Haoru Li,Haoqi Chen,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Seeing Eye is a modular framework enabling text-only LLMs to perform multimodal reasoning by integrating a vision-language translator and a reasoning agent, improving performance and reducing costs compared to larger VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-only LLMs struggle with multimodal tasks due to reliance on single-form captions, lacking fine-grained visual information integration.

Method: Seeing Eye uses a small VLM translator to convert multimodal inputs into structured representations, which are processed by a text-only LLM via multi-round feedback.

Result: The framework outperforms larger VLMs on benchmarks like MMMU and MIA-Bench, with a 3B+8B model surpassing a 32B VLM.

Conclusion: Decoupling perception and reasoning offers a scalable, efficient pathway for text-only LLMs to excel in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only large language models (LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate remarkable reasoning ability. However, these models
remain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks.
Existing approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity
and often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering
(VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel
for transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a
modular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through
an agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception
agent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively
distill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs)
tailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM,
which serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner
engage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of
targeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on
knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate
that Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger
end-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision
translator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B
VLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that
decoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a
scalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong
text-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities. Code is

### [246] [Collaborative Scheduling of Time-dependent UAVs,Vehicles and Workers for Crowdsensing in Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25212)
*Lei Han,Jinhao Zhang,Jinhui Liu,Zhiyong Yu,Liang Wang,Quan Wang,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes HoCs-MPQ, a heterogeneous multi-agent online collaborative scheduling algorithm, to enhance post-disaster environmental information collection by modeling collaboration and conflict relationships via weighted undirected graphs and solving the maximum weight independent set iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sensing technologies lack adaptability and practicality in complex post-disaster environments, necessitating an efficient solution for timely information collection.

Method: HoCs-MPQ constructs weighted undirected graphs based on collaboration and conflict relationships among elements and iteratively solves the maximum weight independent set using multi-priority queues.

Result: Experiments show HoCs-MPQ outperforms baseline methods in task completion rates (up to 54.13% improvement) with scheduling decisions under 3 seconds.

Conclusion: HoCs-MPQ offers a practical and efficient solution for post-disaster environmental information collection, significantly improving performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Frequent natural disasters cause significant losses to human society, and
timely, efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information is the
foundation for effective rescue operations. Due to the extreme complexity of
post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies such as mobile
crowdsensing suffer from weak environmental adaptability, insufficient
professional sensing capabilities, and poor practicality of sensing solutions.
Therefore, this paper explores a heterogeneous multi-agent online collaborative
scheduling algorithm, HoCs-MPQ, to achieve efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoCs-MPQ models collaboration and
conflict relationships among multiple elements through weighted undirected
graph construction, and iteratively solves the maximum weight independent set
based on multi-priority queues, ultimately achieving collaborative sensing
scheduling of time-dependent UA Vs, vehicles, and workers. Specifically, (1)
HoCs-MPQ constructs weighted undirected graph nodes based on collaborative
relationships among multiple elements and quantifies their weights, then models
the weighted undirected graph based on conflict relationships between nodes;
(2) HoCs-MPQ solves the maximum weight independent set based on iterated local
search, and accelerates the solution process using multi-priority queues.
Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and
simulated data. The experiments show that, compared to baseline methods (e.g.,
HoCs-GREEDY, HoCs-K-WTA, HoCs-MADL, and HoCs-MARL), HoCs-MPQ improves task
completion rates by an average of 54.13%, 23.82%, 14.12%, and 12.89%
respectively, with computation time for single online autonomous scheduling
decisions not exceeding 3 seconds.

### [247] [Multi-party Agent Relation Sampling for Multi-party Ad Hoc Teamwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25340)
*Beiwen Zhang,Yongheng Liang,Hejun Wu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MAHT extends ad hoc teamwork to unknown groups, proposing MARs for cross-group dynamics, outperforming MARL and AHT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing coordination with multiple unfamiliar teams in multi-agent tasks, avoiding shared conventions assumption.

Method: Introduces MARs: sparse skeleton graph and relational modeling for cross-group dynamics.

Result: MARs outperforms MARL and AHT baselines, converging faster in MPE and StarCraft II.

Conclusion: MARs effectively handles multi-party ad hoc teamwork, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARl) has achieved strong results in
cooperative tasks but typically assumes fixed, fully controlled teams. Ad hoc
teamwork (AHT) relaxes this by allowing collaboration with unknown partners,
yet existing variants still presume shared conventions. We introduce
Multil-party Ad Hoc Teamwork (MAHT), where controlled agents must coordinate
with multiple mutually unfamiliar groups of uncontrolled teammates. To address
this, we propose MARs, which builds a sparse skeleton graph and applies
relational modeling to capture cross-group dvnamics. Experiments on MPE and
starCralt ll show that MARs outperforms MARL and AHT baselines while converging
faster.
