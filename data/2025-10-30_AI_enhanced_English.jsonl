To address this gap, we introduce the\nGraph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate\nmodeling of dynamic structural problems.\n  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine\nlearning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic\nsimulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in\nnode-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in\nfinite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,\nwhich reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a\nwavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.\n  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz\nHanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the\nphysics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen\nloading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful\npredictions.\n  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial\ninference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These\nfindings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent\nupdate rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated\nstructural simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNSS, a GNN framework, is introduced for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems, outperforming existing GNNs and achieving speedups over finite element methods.", "motivation": "To address the gap in applying GNNs to dynamic structural problems, especially wave-dominated simulations.", "method": "GNSS uses encode-process-decode with node-fixed local frames, sign-aware regression loss, and wavelength-informed connectivity radius.", "result": "GNSS accurately simulates beam dynamics over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loads, outperforming baseline GNNs.", "conclusion": "GNSS is a competitive alternative for dynamic structural simulations, preserving fidelity while speeding up inference."}}

In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process.
