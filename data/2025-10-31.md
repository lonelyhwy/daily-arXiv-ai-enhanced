### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates spatio-temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms (CBAM) in deep learning models for underwater object detection, showing improved accuracy with T-YOLOv5 and CBAM enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object detection in dynamic marine environments with challenges like sudden movements and occlusions.

Method: Developed T-YOLOv5 and augmented it with CBAM, comparing their performance against standard YOLOv5.

Result: T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM outperformed YOLOv5 (mAP@50-95 scores: 0.813 and 0.811 vs. 0.563).

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5 enhances reliability, and CBAM further improves performance in complex scenarios, though simpler cases may see reduced accuracy.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training text-to-image models with multiple reward models during training improves quality, diversity, and efficiency, outperforming post-hoc methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models optimize for diversity but not user preferences, and post-hoc reward models harm diversity and efficiency. The goal is to align models with preferences during training.

Method: Proposed MIRO conditions the model on multiple reward models during training, avoiding post-processing and optimizing for user preferences directly.

Result: MIRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (GenEval, PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2) and speeds up training.

Conclusion: Conditioning models on rewards during training improves alignment with user preferences and outperforms post-hoc methods in quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [3] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach for bicycle safety using the 'SenseBike' platform, introduces the BikeScenes-lidarseg dataset, and demonstrates improved performance with domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability of cyclists, especially with the rise of faster e-bikes, necessitates adapting automotive perception technologies to enhance bicycle safety.

Method: The authors use their 'SenseBike' research platform and introduce the BikeScenes-lidarseg dataset (3021 LiDAR scans with 29 annotated classes) to develop and evaluate a tailored 3D LiDAR segmentation approach.

Result: Fine-tuning on the BikeScenes dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly outperforming the 13.8% from SemanticKITTI pre-training alone.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for domain-specific training for bicycle-mounted perception systems and contributes the BikeScenes dataset to advance cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation research.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using synthetic data trains models to repair and enhance STM images, reducing acquisition time and tip-conditioning needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional STM faces limitations like tip degradation and slow data acquisition, prompting the need for an efficient solution to improve image quality and throughput.

Method: A physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline trained flow-matching and diffusion models on 36 pristine Si(001):H STM images.

Result: Models restored images effectively, achieving a two- to fourfold reduction in acquisition time and high accuracy in sparse data reconstruction, as shown by CMMD and structural similarity metrics.

Conclusion: The ML framework enhances STM throughput by reducing tip-conditioning frequency and improving frame rates in high-speed systems.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework for image editing using flow decomposition-and-aggregation addresses limitations in inversion accuracy and gradient entanglement in existing rectified flow models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow models struggle with inaccurate inversion and gradient entanglement in image editing tasks, leading to suboptimal outputs.

Method: Proposes a flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework, decomposing prompts into sub-prompts, computing independent flows, and aggregating them adaptively to preserve diversity and consistency.

Result: Outperforms existing zero-shot editing approaches in semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances editing quality by addressing inversion and gradient issues, offering improved semantic alignment.

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

### [6] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain-IT uses a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) to faithfully reconstruct images from fMRI by leveraging shared functional brain clusters and localized image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the faithfulness of image reconstructions from fMRI by addressing current methods' limitations.

Method: Brain-IT employs a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) to integrate information from functionally-similar brain-voxel clusters and predict high-level semantic and low-level structural image features.

Result: The method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in visual and objective metrics, achieving comparable results with only 1-hour of fMRI data vs. 40-hour recordings.

Conclusion: Brain-IT's design enables accurate and efficient image reconstruction from fMRI, even with limited data.

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [7] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses real-time tumor tracking in cine-MRI under data scarcity, using SAM 2.1-based segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 0.8794 and ranking 6th in the TrackRAD2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for real-time tumor tracking in cine-MRI sequences of thoracic and abdominal regions despite strong data scarcity constraints.

Method: Two strategies were explored: unsupervised registration with IMPACT similarity metric and SAM 2.1-based segmentation. The latter was chosen due to runtime constraints, fine-tuned on a small labeled subset with balanced Dice + IoU loss and minimal overfitting techniques.

Result: The SAM 2.1-based method achieved a Dice score of 0.8794 on the hidden test set, ranking 6th in the TrackRAD2025 challenge.

Conclusion: Foundation models like SAM 2.1 show strong potential for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, even under data scarcity.

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [8] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism to enhance the Mamba framework, improving feature space exploration and spatial locality, leading to better performance in low-light image enhancement with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address information inconsistencies and improve the capture of fine-scale details in low-light image enhancement while maintaining long-range dependencies.

Method: The method involves increasing the Hausdorff dimension of the Mamba framework's scanning pattern using a novel Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism.

Result: Results show significant improvements in quantitative metrics and visual fidelity, along with reduced computational resource consumption and shorter inference time.

Conclusion: The refined strategy advances low-light image enhancement and has potential for broader applications in Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

### [9] [CAVE: Detecting and Explaining Commonsense Anomalies in Visual Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26006)
*Rishika Bhagwatkar,Syrielle Montariol,Angelika Romanou,Beatriz Borges,Irina Rish,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAVE, a benchmark for real-world visual anomalies, addressing limitations in current datasets and tasks for anomaly detection and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection in computer vision is limited to industrial or synthetic anomalies, lacking the richness of real-world scenarios. CAVE aims to bridge this gap by providing a realistic benchmark.

Method: CAVE includes fine-grained annotations for anomaly description, explanation, and justification, inspired by cognitive science. It evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs struggle with anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even with advanced prompting.

Conclusion: CAVE provides a comprehensive, cognitively grounded benchmark to advance research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning for VLMs.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

### [10] [Climate Adaptation-Aware Flood Prediction for Coastal Cities Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26017)
*Bilal Hassan,Areg Karapetyan,Aaron Chung Hin Chow,Samer Madanat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN model predicts coastal flooding under varying sea-level rise scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by reducing MAE by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of traditional hydrodynamic simulators and data scarcity in DL for coastal flood prediction.

Method: Develop a vision-based, low-resource CNN model tested on datasets from Abu Dhabi and San Francisco.

Result: Model reduces MAE by 20% and generalizes well across diverse regions.

Conclusion: The CNN model offers a scalable, practical tool for coastal flood management, aiding climate change mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in Video-LLMs' temporal understanding by introducing stacked temporal attention modules in the vision encoder, improving performance in video QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with complex temporal dynamics in videos, particularly in understanding action sequences and temporal progression.

Method: The proposed architecture integrates stacked temporal attention modules within the vision encoder to enhance temporal reasoning.

Result: The method outperforms existing models by up to +5.5% on benchmarks like VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME.

Conclusion: Enhancing the vision encoder with temporal attention addresses a key gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs, with code and project details publicly available.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL, a novel in-context learning framework, improves segmentation of bony regions in pediatric US images with limited labeled data, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of time-consuming and costly expert annotations for training DL models in US image segmentation, especially for pediatric fractures.

Method: Proposes FlexICL, a flexible in-context learning framework, leveraging novel concatenation techniques and augmentation strategies to segment bony regions with minimal labeled data.

Result: FlexICL achieves robust performance across four US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models by 1-27% Dice coefficient using only 5% of training images.

Conclusion: FlexICL is an efficient, scalable solution for US image segmentation, particularly suitable for medical imaging with scarce labeled data.

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

### [13] [Dynamic VLM-Guided Negative Prompting for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26052)
*Hoyeon Chang,Seungjin Kim,Yoonseok Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion models uses VLMs to adaptively generate context-aware negative prompts during denoising, improving text-image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional negative prompting uses fixed prompts, which may not adapt well to the denoising process. This work aims to improve alignment by dynamically generating negative prompts.

Method: Generates intermediate image predictions during denoising, queries a VLM for contextually appropriate negative prompts, and adjusts guidance strength.

Result: Demonstrated on benchmark datasets, showing trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: Dynamic negative prompting with VLMs enhances diffusion model performance by adapting prompts to the denoising context.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [14] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights the vulnerability of multi-modal diffusion models (e.g., text-to-image models) to adversarial inputs, proposing a novel attack (PReMA) that manipulates outputs by modifying input images while keeping prompts unchanged.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal diffusion models exhibit inadequate alignment between text and image modalities, posing risks like generating inappropriate content. The study aims to explore this vulnerability.

Method: Introduces PReMA, a method that manipulates model outputs by creating adversarial images without altering the prompt, unlike previous attacks that focused on adversarial prompts.

Result: PReMA demonstrates significant efficacy in manipulating outputs for tasks like image inpainting and style transfer across various models.

Conclusion: PReMA reveals a novel threat to multi-modal diffusion models, especially in applications with fixed prompts, underscoring the need for improved model robustness.

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

*Minjoon Jung,Junbin Xiao,Junghyun Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoExo-Con, a benchmark for evaluating Video-LLMs' temporal understanding consistency across egocentric and exocentric views, and proposes View-GRPO to improve cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if Video-LLMs can maintain consistent temporal understanding when videos capture the same event from different viewpoints.

Method: Introduces EgoExo-Con, a benchmark with synchronized video pairs, and proposes View-GRPO, an RL framework to enhance cross-view consistency.

Result: Existing Video-LLMs struggle with consistency; View-GRPO outperforms standard fine-tuning and GRPO in improving cross-view consistency.

Conclusion: View-GRPO effectively enhances Video-LLMs' temporal reasoning across viewpoints, addressing inconsistencies in existing models.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleAgent is an agent system designed to manage and retrieve Oracle Bone Script (OBS) information, integrating analysis tools and a multimodal knowledge base to improve efficiency and accuracy in OBS research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OBS research struggles with complex interpretation workflows and inefficient resource management, necessitating a structured solution.

Method: OracleAgent integrates multiple OBS analysis tools powered by LLMs and uses a multimodal knowledge base built from extensive data collection and expert annotation.

Result: OracleAgent outperforms leading MLLMs in multimodal tasks and significantly reduces research time for experts.

Conclusion: OracleAgent advances OBS research by providing efficient, automated assistance, marking progress toward practical deployment in the field.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified framework for novel view synthesis that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses, eliminating the need for pre-calibrated inputs and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses computational bottlenecks and errors from external camera pose estimation tools like COLMAP by developing a co-optimization strategy.

Method: Uses a two-phase interleaved approach: optimizing 3D Gaussian parameters with fixed poses via differentiable rendering, and refining camera poses with a customized 3D optical flow algorithm.

Result: Outperforms COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality and surpasses COLMAP-based baselines, especially in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively eliminates dependency on pre-calibration, improves pose accuracy, and enhances scene reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

*Runsheng Xu,Hubert Lin,Wonseok Jeon,Hao Feng,Yuliang Zou,Liting Sun,John Gorman,Kate Tolstaya,Sarah Tang,Brandyn White,Ben Sapp,Mingxing Tan,Jyh-Jing Hwang,Drago Anguelov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WOD-E2E, a dataset for end-to-end driving focused on challenging long-tail scenarios, and proposes a novel evaluation metric, RFS, to better assess driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E driving benchmarks lack challenging scenarios and adequate evaluation metrics, limiting the assessment of autonomous driving systems.

Method: The authors curate the WOD-E2E dataset with 4,021 segments of rare driving scenarios and introduce the RFS metric to evaluate trajectory predictions based on rater-annotated preferences.

Result: WOD-E2E provides a robust resource for testing E2E driving systems in rare, complex situations, and RFS offers a more nuanced evaluation metric.

Conclusion: The work aims to advance research in generalizable and robust autonomous driving by addressing gaps in datasets and evaluation methods.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

*Ali Caglayan,Nevrez Imamoglu,Oguzhan Guclu,Ali Osman Serhatoglu,Ahmet Burak Can,Ryosuke Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating gradient-based attention with CNN features to enhance RGB-D indoor SLAM, showing improved performance in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limited integration of gradient-based attention into CNN representations for tasks like SLAM, where attentive object locations can boost performance.

Method: The approach combines layer-wise attention information from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve frame association in RGB-D indoor SLAM.

Result: Experiments demonstrate better performance compared to baseline methods, especially in large environments.

Conclusion: Integrating task-specific network attention with CNN features effectively enhances SLAM performance, particularly for large-scale indoor scenes.

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FullPart is a novel framework combining implicit and explicit paradigms for detailed 3D part generation, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of implicit vector-set tokens (lack of detail) and shared voxel grids (degraded quality for small parts) in 3D part generation.

Method: Uses an implicit box vector-set diffusion for bounding box layout and explicit full-resolution voxel grids for detailed part generation, with a center-point encoding strategy for alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation, demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FullPart effectively combines implicit and explicit methods for high-quality 3D part generation, supported by the new PartVerse-XL dataset.

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BasicAVSR is a strong baseline for arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) that integrates adaptive multi-scale frequency priors, flow-guided propagation, second-order motion compensation, and hyper-upsampling to outperform existing methods in quality, generalization, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR faces challenges in spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and computational complexity, necessitating a robust solution like BasicAVSR.

Method: BasicAVSR combines adaptive multi-scale frequency priors, flow-guided propagation, second-order motion compensation, and hyper-upsampling, with three propagation variants for diverse application demands.

Result: BasicAVSR outperforms existing methods in super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference speed, demonstrating effectiveness across different scenarios.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR advances AVSR state-of-the-art and extends its core components for diverse frameworks, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

*Shunjie-Fabian Zheng,Hyeonjun Lee,Thijs Kooi,Ali Diba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MV-MLM, a Vision-Language Model leveraging multi-view mammography and synthetic radiology reports for breast cancer classification and risk prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large annotated datasets are costly and time-consuming to acquire, motivating the use of VLMs like CLIP to enhance robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks.

Method: MV-MLM employs cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs, using multi-view mammograms and synthetic reports for joint visual-textual learning.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in malignancy classification, subtype classification, and cancer risk prediction, outperforming supervised baselines.

Conclusion: MV-MLM demonstrates strong data efficiency and generalization, proving effective for breast cancer tasks without relying on actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning-based approach using YOLOv8 for real-time auto-rickshaw detection in traffic images, achieving high performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-rickshaws in Bangladesh face traffic restrictions, but monitoring them is challenging due to similarities with non-auto rickshaws and time-consuming manual video analysis.

Method: The paper employs the YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection, trained on 1,730 annotated images under diverse traffic conditions.

Result: The model achieves an mAP50 of 83.447%, with binary precision and recall values above 78%, effective in dense and sparse traffic.

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective for auto-rickshaw detection, and the dataset is made public for further research.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAG-MM is a benchmark for Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) focused on wearable scenarios, featuring diverse datasets and tasks. Current RAG methods show limited effectiveness, indicating significant room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a comprehensive benchmark for MM-RAG in wearable scenarios motivated the creation of CRAG-MM.

Method: CRAG-MM includes 6.5K image-question-answer triplets and 2K multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, designed to mimic wearable device captures. It features three tasks: single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations.

Result: Current RAG methods achieve only 32%-43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM, showing limited effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: CRAG-MM highlights the challenges in MM-RAG for wearables and underscores the need for further research and improvement.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTDiff is a new framework using diffusion models to estimate high-resolution motion trajectories from single motion-blurred images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion representations are low-quality (coarse-grained and inaccurate), necessitating a better method for accurate motion estimation.

Method: MoTDiff uses a conditional diffusion framework with multi-scale feature maps and a novel training method for fine-grained motion trajectory estimation.

Result: Experiments show MoTDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography.

Conclusion: MoTDiff provides high-quality motion trajectory estimation, advancing capabilities in computational imaging and computer vision.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope is an automated framework for discovering and quantifying dataset biases using Sparse Autoencoders trained on vision foundation models. It categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types, enabling robust dataset analysis and bias detection without fine-grained annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset bias is common but difficult to identify without costly annotations. ConceptScope aims to automate this process for scalable and interpretable bias analysis.

Method: The framework uses Sparse Autoencoders on vision foundation model representations to discover human-interpretable concepts. It categorizes concepts by semantic relevance and statistical correlation to labels.

Result: ConceptScope identifies diverse visual concepts and aligns spatial attributions with meaningful image regions. It detects known biases (e.g., Waterbirds) and uncovers new ones (e.g., ImageNet).

Conclusion: ConceptScope provides a practical tool for dataset auditing and model diagnostics by automating bias detection and improving robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

*Li Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Yanwen Wang,Xun Cao,Chuan Guo,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for 3D human pose estimation from sketches using a synthetic dataset and diffusion models, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sketch-to-pose methods are limited by the lack of large-scale annotated data and rely on time-consuming optimization. This paper aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: A 'learn from synthesis' strategy is adopted, involving a diffusion model to generate synthetic sketches from 2D poses, creating a dataset (SKEP-120K). An end-to-end framework combines 2D pose detectors, diffusion priors, and feed-forward networks.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and speed, validated by qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the challenges of sketch-based 3D pose estimation and sets a new benchmark for future work.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN) for sustainable supply chain management, achieving high accuracy in risk administration and product classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance supply chain sustainability and performance efficiency by addressing risk management and product classification using deep learning.

Method: The Ch-EGN combines convolutional and geometric deep learning to analyze supply chain datasets (SupplyGraph and DataCo) for invisible state derivation, delivery status prediction, and product/edge classification.

Result: Achieved 98.95% accuracy for risk management, 100% and 98.07% for product classification, and 92.37% for company relation classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Ch-EGN is effective for improving supply chain sustainability and performance, demonstrating superior accuracy in various tasks.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: Current research focuses on document layout analysis (DLA), neglecting document layout generation. The lack of diverse layouts in datasets and poor performance in complex domains motivated this work.

Method: They curated OmniLayout-1M dataset and developed OmniLayout-LLM, a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning model.

Result: The approach outperforms existing layout generation methods and general-purpose LLMs on the M$^{6}$Doc dataset.

Conclusion: The work advances document layout generation by providing a diverse dataset and a scalable model with strong performance.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with temporal reasoning, lagging behind humans in judging video playback direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate VLMs' weak grasp of temporal information in videos using a simple yet revealing challenge.

Method: Developed AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark testing VLMs' ability to infer temporal direction.

Result: Most VLMs performed near chance, significantly trailing human accuracy in recognizing temporal and causal events.

Conclusion: VLMs lack inductive biases for temporal continuity and causal understanding, highlighting a key gap in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

*Lin Guo,Xiaoqing Luo,Wei Xie,Zhancheng Zhang,Hui Li,Rui Wang,Zhenhua Feng,Xiaoning Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCLFuse, a novel infrared and visible image fusion method inspired by human cognition, addressing limitations in modal information balance and interpretability through innovative encoder and diffusion model techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods struggle with balancing modal information and lack interpretability, limiting reliability in complex scenarios. HCLFuse aims to improve this by leveraging human cognitive laws.

Method: HCLFuse uses a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder for low-level modal information extraction and integrates a diffusion model with physical laws for adaptive generation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, enhancing structural consistency and detail quality.

Conclusion: HCLFuse demonstrates significant improvements in fusion performance and semantic segmentation metrics, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of CNN architectures (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, ResNet50) for periocular verification shows fusion achieves state-of-the-art results, leveraging complementary attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification across varying distances and improve performance via fusion.

Method: Training three CNNs on eye crops from VGGFace2, analyzing with cosine and chi2 metrics, comparing initializations, and applying score-level fusion with logistic regression. LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon divergence are used to compare attention patterns.

Result: ResNet50 performs best individually, but fusion of all three networks yields substantial gains. Heatmaps reveal distinct attention regions, confirming complementarity. Achieves state-of-the-art on UBIPr.

Conclusion: Combining multiple CNNs with complementary attention patterns significantly enhances periocular verification performance, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

*Lin Liu,Guanyi Yu,Ziying Song,Junqiao Li,Caiyan Jia,Feiyang Jia,Peiliang Wu,Yandan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATG is a novel planning framework for autonomous driving that uses Constrained Flow Matching to avoid mode collapse and incorporate safety constraints directly into trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning methods suffer from mode collapse, while generative approaches lack direct safety constraint integration, requiring additional refinement.

Method: CATG leverages Constrained Flow Matching, modeling the flow process to mitigate mode collapse and impose explicit safety and kinematic constraints directly.

Result: CATG achieved 2nd place in the NavSim v2 challenge with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and won the Innovation Award.

Conclusion: CATG effectively addresses mode collapse and safety constraints in autonomous driving planning, demonstrating superior performance and innovation.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

*Fernando Alonso-Fernandez,Kevin Hernandez-Diaz,Jose Maria Buades Rubio,Josef Bigun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three CNN architectures for periocular recognition using a large-scale dataset (VGGFace2) and compares performance against smaller datasets, achieving lower error rates with controlled conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of periocular biometrics using CNNs, leveraging large-scale datasets for improved accuracy compared to existing small-scale approaches.

Method: Train three CNN architectures on ocular crops from VGGFace2, testing on subsets (VGGFace2-Pose and UFPR-Periocular) to evaluate recognition performance.

Result: Higher error rates (9-15% EER) with uncontrolled conditions (VGGFace2-Pose) versus lower rates (1-2% EER) with controlled conditions (UFPR-Periocular), setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: Large-scale training improves periocular recognition, but controlled acquisition protocols significantly enhance performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on UFPR.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods simplify complexities in AEOS scheduling, limiting real-world performance. The paper aims to fill this gap with a realistic benchmark and advanced scheduling model.

Method: The authors develop AEOS-Bench, a benchmark suite with 3,907 satellite assets and 16,410 scenarios, and AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based model with constraint-aware attention and iterative learning.

Result: AEOS-Former outperforms baselines in task completion and energy efficiency, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for AEOS scheduling, supported by openly available code and data.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

*Junlai Qiu,Yunzhu Chen,Hao Zheng,Yawen Huang,Yuexiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model combining CNN and ViT backbones using evidential fusion to improve diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR causes vision loss, and current methods using single backbones (CNN/ViT) face performance bottlenecks. Combining their strengths (local and global features) could enhance results.

Method: A novel evidential fusion paradigm transforms features from CNN and ViT into supporting evidences via deep evidential networks, enabling adaptive fusion and improved performance.

Result: Tested on two DR datasets, the hybrid model outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks in grading accuracy and offers interpretability for feature fusion and decisions.

Conclusion: Integrating CNN and ViT with evidential fusion effectively enhances DR grading performance and provides interpretable decision-making insights.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

Motivation: Existing methods often ignore spatial attention mechanisms, limiting the quality of EEG-driven image reconstruction.

Method: Proposes a framework using Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction, fine-tunes Stable Diffusion 2.1 via LoRA, and incorporates ControlNet for spatial saliency conditioning.

Result: Achieves significant improvement in image feature quality and alignment with human visual attention on THINGS-EEG dataset.

Conclusion: Attentional priors resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces.

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

TL;DR: LoCoT2V-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating long video generation under complex prompts, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by introducing realistic prompts and multi-dimensional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook fine-grained alignment and abstract dimensions like narrative coherence in long-form video generation.

Method: Introduces LoCoT2V-Bench with realistic prompts and a multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including new metrics like HERD.

Result: Current models perform well on basic aspects but struggle with inter-event consistency and thematic adherence.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench offers a reliable platform for evaluation and highlights future improvement directions.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces A-TPT, a test-time prompt tuning framework that improves calibration in vision-language models by maximizing angular diversity of textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TPT methods lack optimal angular separation between class-wise textual features, hurting calibration performance. Addressing this gap can enhance reliability and safety of VLMs.

Method: A-TPT enforces uniformity in normalized textual feature distribution by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance on the unit hypersphere.

Result: A-TPT outperforms state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing calibration error while maintaining accuracy, especially under natural distribution shifts and medical datasets.

Conclusion: Promoting angular diversity improves textual feature dispersion, significantly enhancing VLM calibration during test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage advancements in 3D reconstruction models for improving point tracking tasks, especially focusing on static and dynamic point correspondences.

Method: Adapts DUSt3R and MASt3R models by combining reconstruction loss with dynamic correspondence training, adding a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R with synthetic data. Evaluates on frame pairs containing query points.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on benchmarks (e.g., TAP-Vid-DAVIS, EgoPoints, RGB-S) and outperforms CoTracker models in some cases. Also presents 3D point tracking results and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The adapted models (PointSt3R) demonstrate strong point tracking capabilities, particularly when combining static and dynamic correspondence training, and achieve state-of-the-art results on certain datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FineGrainedAD, a framework enhancing few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) by introducing multi-level fine-grained textual descriptions (MFSC) and improving semantic alignment between text and visual patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods suffer from semantic misalignment due to limited textual descriptions, leading to sub-optimal anomaly localization.

Method: Introduces MFSC for detailed textual descriptions and FineGrainedAD framework with Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA) components.

Result: FineGrainedAD outperforms existing methods in few-shot anomaly detection on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses semantic misalignment, improving anomaly localization performance.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

TL;DR: The paper addresses object-context shortcuts in vision-language models by reframing the issue as causal inference, improving zero-shot reliability without retraining or prompt design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The persistent challenge of object-context shortcuts undermines zero-shot reliability, especially when test scenes differ from training co-occurrences.

Method: The approach estimates object and background expectations in CLIP's representation space, synthesizes counterfactual embeddings, and uses causal inference (Total Direct Effect) to mitigate biases.

Result: The method significantly improves worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, setting a new zero-shot state of the art.

Conclusion: The framework offers a lightweight, representation-level counterfactual approach for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: To address the 'Matthew effect' in LVLM self-improvement, where models favor simple queries over complex ones, limiting overall reasoning performance.

Method: Introduces four strategies (distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling) to balance head-tail data during self-improvement.

Result: Achieves consistent improvement in visual reasoning, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies effectively counteract the Matthew effect, enhancing LVLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

*Vinícius Ferraria,Eurico Ruivo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptable edge detector using cellular automaton and meta-heuristic optimization with transfer learning, finding limited benefits from expanding the search space or transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address weaknesses in edge detection, such as detecting loose edges and lack of contextual information, by developing an adaptable detector.

Method: Uses a 2D cellular automaton optimized by meta-heuristics and transfer learning techniques to improve edge detection.

Result: Expanding the search space was ineffective, and transfer learning showed no significant improvements; the model adapted well to inputs regardless.

Conclusion: The adaptable detector works well but gains little from expanded search or transfer learning.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

*Hao Xie,Zixun Huang,Yushen Zuo,Yakun Ju,Frank H. F. Leung,N. F. Law,Kin-Man Lam,Yong-Ping Zheng,Sai Ho Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA²Net is proposed for spine segmentation in ultrasound VPI, addressing challenges like spatial correlation and structural knowledge with scale-adaptive and structure-affinity strategies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in spine segmentation include neglected spatial correlation and unencoded structural knowledge of bone features, hindering effective scoliosis diagnosis.

Method: SA²Net uses a scale-adaptive complementary strategy for cross-dimensional correlation and structure-affinity transformation with a Transformer decoder, enhanced by feature mixing loss aggregation.

Result: SA²Net achieves superior segmentation performance and adapts well to various backbones, proving effective for scoliosis diagnosis.

Conclusion: SA²Net is a robust and accurate tool for spine segmentation, enhancing intelligent scoliosis diagnosis.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework for creating multiple ad versions of varying durations using audio-visual fusion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual ad clipping is labor-intensive; the paper aims to automate this process for advertising campaigns.

Method: A two-stream audio-visual fusion model predicts frame importance, tailored for ads, using a novel dataset (AdSum204).

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics like Average Precision and Spearman.

Conclusion: The framework effectively automates ad clipping, highlighting audio's role and introducing a valuable dataset.

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

*Manjunath Prasad Holenarasipura Rajiv,B. M. Vidyavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using vision-language alignment improves zero-shot scene understanding in unfamiliar environments, showing a 18% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems struggle to generalize in unseen scenarios without labeled data, limiting real-world applications.

Method: Integrates vision transformers and language models, aligning visual semantics with text for contextual understanding.

Result: Achieves up to 18% better accuracy on benchmarks like COCO and Visual Genome.

Conclusion: The framework enhances scalable, interpretable zero-shot generalization for dynamic environments.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for cross-domain adaptation in Visual Question Answering (VQA), improving generalization across diverse domains without retraining the backbone model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models perform well in natural image domains but struggle with out-of-domain scenarios like remote sensing or medical imaging due to distributional shifts and lack of domain adaptation mechanisms. Current solutions are costly and inflexible.

Method: CATCH decouples visual and linguistic adaptation using lightweight modules: a domain classifier and dual adapters (Prompt Adapter for language and Visual Adapter for vision). These modules are dynamically injected without retraining the backbone.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show performance gains (+2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA) without reconfiguring the core model.

Conclusion: CATCH offers a scalable and extensible solution for multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance multimodal reasoning and generation by unifying vision-language prediction in a single model, addressing the need for efficient and versatile world modeling.

Method: Emu3.5 uses end-to-end pre-training with a next-token prediction objective, reinforcement learning post-training, and DiDA for parallel prediction to improve inference speed.

Result: Emu3.5 excels in multimodal generation tasks, matches Gemini 2.5 Flash Image in image tasks, and shows superior performance in interleaved generation.

Conclusion: Emu3.5 demonstrates strong multimodal capabilities and efficiency, offering open-source support for community research.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

*Anirban Ray,Vera Galinova,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching is a novel CSR method using guided conditional flow matching to learn strong data-priors, achieving competitive results with the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism, especially in noisy scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSR in fluorescence microscopy aims to extrapolate missing frequencies in micrographs. Better data-driven techniques can learn stronger priors for improved results.

Method: ResMatching employs guided conditional flow matching to learn improved data-priors, evaluated on diverse biological structures from BioSR.

Result: ResMatching outperforms 7 baselines, excelling in noisy conditions and providing calibrated uncertainty for predictions.

Conclusion: ResMatching enhances CSR performance, particularly in challenging scenarios, and offers reliable uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crop yield prediction is vital for food security and precision farming, but traditional methods lack scalability and granularity.

Method: CYPRESS adapts Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M to transform multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense, pixel-level yield maps via regression.

Result: CYPRESS outperforms existing deep learning models in predicting canola yields on a dataset from the Canadian Prairies.

Conclusion: CYPRESS bridges Earth observation and farm decision-making, offering scalable high-resolution yield predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

TL;DR: Tokenization method Spiking Patches preserves event camera properties, outperforming frames/voxels in speed and accuracy for gesture recognition and object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover an event representation that preserves the asynchronous and spatially sparse properties of event cameras, addressing limitations of frames and voxels.

Method: Proposes Spiking Patches tokenizer, evaluated with GNN, PCN, and Transformer on gesture recognition and object detection.

Result: Spiking Patches achieves up to 10.4x faster inference than frames, matches/surpasses accuracy (up to 3.8% improvement).

Conclusion: Tokenization with Spiking Patches is a promising direction for event-based vision, preserving camera properties while improving performance.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box

Result: Highlights current capabilities, limitations, and potential integration of LLM/VLM-driven frameworks in AV perception.

Conclusion: Presents a roadmap for future opportunities and challenges in AV object detection, emphasizing emerging technologies.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains

intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: Deep learning optical flow models outperform classical methods in estimating sea ice drift from SAR imagery, achieving sub-kilometer accuracy and enabling spatially continuous motion fields for Arctic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sea ice drift estimation is vital for Arctic navigation, climate research, and forecasting, but traditional optical flow methods are limited.

Method: 48 deep learning optical flow models were benchmarked on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR imagery, evaluated against GNSS-tracked buoys using EPE and Fl metrics.

Result: Several models achieved sub-kilometer accuracy (300-400 m), capturing regional drift patterns and proving superior to classical methods.

Conclusion: Deep learning optical flow methods can effectively transfer to polar remote sensing, offering continuous drift fields for improved navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions hinder object recognition; leveraging scene context can enhance robustness.

Method: Two scene-based fusion techniques: pre-prediction custom network selection and post-detection score fusion.

Result: Improved recall and precision on occlusion-heavy datasets; training on mixed occluded/unoccluded images works best.

Conclusion: Interpretable and adaptable method with potential for future research and applications.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

### [60] [SteerVLM: Robust Model Control through Lightweight Activation Steering for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26769)
*Anushka Sivakumar,Andrew Zhang,Zaber Hakim,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteerVLM is a lightweight steering module that dynamically adjusts VLM activations for better instruction adherence without altering model weights, using only 0.14% of the VLM's parameters. It introduces VNIA dataset for evaluation and outperforms existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) adherence to desired instructions dynamically while preserving performance on unrelated tasks.

Method: Learns from latent embeddings of paired prompts to modulate activations between language and image modalities adaptively across layers, avoiding static vectors or manual tuning.

Result: Outperforms existing intervention techniques on steering and hallucination benchmarks, achieving fine-grained control without significant parameter overhead.

Conclusion: SteerVLM offers a robust, lightweight solution for controlling VLMs via activation engineering, supported by the new VNIA dataset.

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

*Valentyna Starodub,Mantas Lukoševičius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a semantic segmentation framework for detecting AMD lesions in RGB fundus images, improving upon the ADAM challenge benchmarks with optimized architecture and training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMD is a major cause of vision loss in older adults, and detecting lesions via non-invasive RGB fundus images is cost-effective and practical.

Method: The study builds on U-Net connectivity, evaluating pre-processing techniques, encoder types, and loss functions to address class imbalances.

Result: The proposed framework surpasses prior ADAM challenge submissions in multi-class segmentation of AMD lesions.

Conclusion: The freely available framework offers an improved solution for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in
this paper is made freely available.

*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel data-driven hierarchical motion modeling method using graph-based hierarchies to decompose motions into parent-inherited patterns and residuals, validated on 1D, 2D, and 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of manually-defined hierarchies and fixed motion primitives, enabling generalizable and interpretable motion modeling across tasks.

Method: Represents motions via graph hierarchies, decomposing global motions into parent-inherited and residual components using differentiable graph learning with GNNs.

Result: Successfully reconstructs intrinsic hierarchies in 1D/2D cases and produces realistic 3D deformations, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The method provides an adaptable, data-driven paradigm for hierarchical motion modeling, applicable to diverse motion-centric tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViMoGen, a framework transferring video generation insights to 3D motion generation, enhancing generalization through a large dataset, unified modeling, and a hierarchical benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the generalization bottleneck in 3D motion generation by leveraging insights from video generation.

Method: Developed ViMoGen-228K dataset, flow-matching-based diffusion transformer (ViMoGen and ViMoGen-light), and MBench benchmark.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in automatic and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework advances motion generation by integrating video generation knowledge and introduces scalable tools.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combines proxy classification and aerial imagery embeddings for fine-grained geo-localization across large regions, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image retrieval techniques fail at global scale due to inefficiency and insufficient coverage, necessitating scalable solutions.

Method: Uses a proxy classification task to learn rich feature representations and combines them with aerial imagery embeddings for robust retrieval.

Result: Localizes within 200m for over 68% of queries in a dataset covering Europe.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enables accurate, large-scale geo-localization.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

### [65] [SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796)
*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE4D introduces a pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework for synthesizing 4D content from casual videos, eliminating the need for costly 3D supervision by using a view-conditional video inpainting model and virtual cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-to-4D methods rely on manual camera pose annotations, which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Existing warp-then-inpaint approaches complicate scene dynamics and modeling.

Method: SEE4D replaces trajectory prediction with rendering to fixed virtual cameras, separating camera control from scene modeling. It trains a view-conditional video inpainting model to inpaint missing regions and uses spatiotemporal autoregressive inference for coherent generation.

Result: SEE4D outperforms pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines in cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks, achieving superior generalization and performance.

Conclusion: SEE4D advances practical 4D world modeling by simplifying camera control and improving scene synthesis from casual videos without explicit 3D annotations.

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

### [66] [Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799)
*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Masked diffusion captioning (MDC) learns visual features by reconstructing masked text tokens from images, offering competitive performance in downstream vision tasks compared to autoregressive and contrastive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve visual feature learning by addressing the positional dependency limitation of autoregressive captioning, using masked diffusion captioning for a more balanced learning signal.

Method: MDC trains a decoder conditioned on visual features to reconstruct masked text tokens from image-caption pairs, randomly masking tokens during training.

Result: Linear probing experiments show MDC-learned features are competitive with those from autoregressive and contrastive approaches across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: MDC provides an effective alternative for visual feature learning, reducing reliance on auxiliary objectives and achieving strong downstream task performance.

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniX leverages 2D generative models to create graphics-ready 3D scenes, focusing on panoramic perception of geometry, textures, and PBR materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance panorama-based 2D lifting techniques for generating immersive and physically realistic 3D scenes.

Method: Repurposes 2D generative models through OmniX, a unified framework with a cross-modal adapter, for panoramic perception and scene generation.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation.

Conclusion: Opens new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic virtual world generation.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether video generation models like Veo-3 can serve as zero-shot reasoners in visual reasoning tasks. It finds they excel in short-horizon spatial coherence but struggle with long-horizon causal reasoning and abstract logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if video models encode enough world knowledge to act as zero-shot reasoners in complex visual scenarios.

Method: Empirical study of Veo-3 across 12 dimensions (spatial, geometric, etc.) using a curated benchmark (MME-CoF) for systematic evaluation.

Result: Models show strengths in short-horizon spatial coherence and fine-grained grounding but falter in long-horizon reasoning and strict geometric constraints.

Conclusion: Current video models are not reliable standalone zero-shot reasoners but show potential as complementary tools alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreetMath, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' approximation abilities in informal math, revealing they often default to exact calculations or tool use despite the task's nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' approximation skills in fast-paced, informal math, an understudied area, especially in non-autoregressive models.

Method: Developed StreetMath benchmark; evaluated models (Qwen3-4B, Dream-v0, Falcon-Mamba, Mamba-GPT-3B) using mechanistic interpretability.

Result: LLMs default to exact calculations or tools, even for approximation tasks, and use more tokens than necessary. Exact and approximate math involve distinct neural components.

Conclusion: LLMs lack human-like cognitive miserliness in street math, highlighting a gap in their reasoning adaptation.

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based approach to classify opinion words by sentiment strength and orientation for ranking products based on reviews and queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lexicon-based sentiment analysis lacks consideration for varying strengths of opinions (e.g., very strong vs. weak). The study aims to address this gap.

Method: Combines opinion words (adverbs, adjectives, nouns, verbs) with fuzzy logic to classify sentiments into granular levels (very weak to very strong). Uses syntactic dependency resolution to link opinions to specific product aspects.

Result: Entities can be ranked based on sentiment strength and orientation, improving accuracy in sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances sentiment analysis by incorporating strength and granularity in opinion classification.

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interaction-centric framework for forming synergistic multi-agent LLM teams without prior knowledge, using semantic coherence and community detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of forming optimal multi-agent LLM teams due to model opacity,the paper aims to automate team composition.

Method: The framework constructs a 'language model graph' based on pairwise conversation coherence and applies community detection to identify synergistic clusters.

Result: Experiments show the method identifies functionally coherent groups, outperforming random baselines and matching manually-curated teams.

Conclusion: The framework provides a basis for automated design of collaborative LLM teams.

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LASTIST dataset, a large-scale Korean dataset for target-independent stance detection, addressing gaps in low-resource language research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most stance detection research and datasets focus on target-dependent tasks and English, leaving low-resource languages like Korean underserved.

Method: The LASTIST dataset was constructed using 563,299 labeled Korean sentences from political press releases, with detailed collection and construction processes.

Result: The dataset supports target-independent stance detection and diachronic evolution stance detection, and state-of-the-art models were trained on it.

Conclusion: The LASTIST dataset fills a critical research gap and is publicly available for further development in stance detection for Korean and similar languages.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

TL;DR: The paper introduces zFLoRA, a zero-latency fused low-rank adapter for large language models (LLMs), addressing the disproportionate compute overhead of traditional adapters during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task-specific adapters for LLMs, though small in size (<1% of the base model), introduce significant latency (up to 2.5x) during inference. This paper aims to eliminate this overhead.

Method: Proposes zFLoRA, a fused low-rank adapter that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead. It is tested on LLMs of sizes 1B, 3B, and 7B across 18 tasks in commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, and summary-dialogue categories.

Result: zFLoRA outperforms benchmarks like LoRA and full fine-tuning (FFT) with no added latency, as validated on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) and GPU (NVIDIA H100) platforms.

Conclusion: zFLoRA effectively eliminates the latency overhead of traditional adapters, making it a practical solution for deploying LLMs with multiple task-specific adapters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN framework uses LLMs as zero-shot preference oracles to streamline complex decision-making with natural language, offering two algorithms: LISTEN-U for parametric utility refinement and LISTEN-T for robust non-parametric selections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts face challenges in formalizing complex preferences for multi-objective decisions, requiring a solution that leverages natural language and LLMs.

Method: LISTEN employs LISTEN-U (parametric utility function refinement) and LISTEN-T (non-parametric tournament-style selections) to handle LLM constraints like context windows.

Result: LISTEN-U performs well with parametrically aligned preferences, while LISTEN-T shows robust performance across diverse tasks like flight booking and exam scheduling.

Conclusion: LISTEN demonstrates the potential of using natural language and LLMs to simplify multi-objective decision-making, reducing cognitive burden.

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter is a framework for curating training data to improve long-context language models by identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-text data often lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies, making training inefficient. Careful data selection is needed to leverage extended context effectively.

Method: LongFilter measures information gain by comparing model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings to identify samples requiring long-range dependencies.

Result: Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B show LongFilter effectively selects high-quality data, improving performance on benchmarks like HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Conclusion: LongFilter enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of long-context pretraining by focusing on data where extended context is crucial.

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how personas influence fairness and neutrality in LLMs for content moderation, revealing ideological biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how personas affect harmful content classification and ensure fairness in LLM-based moderation systems.

Method: Examined LLM architectures, sizes, and content modalities; analyzed classification accuracy and behavioral shifts with ideological personas.

Result: Personas with ideological leanings biased judgments, increasing within-ideology consistency but widening divergence across groups.

Conclusion: Persona conditioning introduces subtle biases, raising concerns about reinforcing partisan perspectives under neutrality claims.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [78] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The CLEAR method enhances clinical question answering by using entity-aware retrieval, achieving better performance with fewer tokens compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in extracting semantic information from EHRs due to base64 encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources motivates the need for improved retrieval methods.

Method: The CLEAR method employs entity-aware retrieval, tested against zero-shot large context inference and traditional chunk-based retrieval augmented generation using a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform.

Result: CLEAR achieved a 58.3% win rate, 0.878 average semantic similarity, and used 78% fewer tokens than wide context processing, with the largest gains on long notes (75% win rate for documents >65,000 tokens).

Conclusion: Entity-aware retrieval improves efficiency and accuracy in clinical NLP, and the evaluation framework provides a reusable benchmark for assessing clinical QA systems.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Motivation: Addressing the high costs and diminishing returns of manual annotation in LLM post-training to improve data efficiency.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy covering data selection, quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, distillation, compression, and self-evolving ecosystems.

Result: Summarizes representative methods and identifies future research directions for data-efficient LLM post-training.

Conclusion: Highlights open problems and potential research avenues to maximize data utilization in LLM training.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler for (semi-)automatic FrameNet-like semantic annotation, comparing manual, automatic, and semi-automatic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance and impact of LLM-based tools in creating annotated datasets, focusing on FrameNet-like semantic annotation.

Method: The study compares annotation time, coverage, and diversity across manual, automatic, and semi-automatic annotation settings.

Result: Semi-automatic annotation improves frame diversity and matches human-only coverage, while fully automatic annotation performs poorly except in speed.

Conclusion: Hybrid semi-automatic annotation is effective for semantic labeling, balancing diversity and coverage, while fully automatic methods lag in quality.

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP, an agentic pipeline, improves memorized training data extraction from LLMs using feedback-driven loops and jailbreaking to overcome alignment-induced refusals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to determine what a large language model (LLM) has seen in its training data without direct inspection, using the model's own outputs as evidence.

Method: RECAP employs a feedback-driven loop where initial extractions are evaluated by a secondary model, discrepancies are identified, and correction hints guide subsequent generations. It also includes a jailbreaking module to bypass alignment-induced refusals.

Result: RECAP significantly outperforms single-iteration approaches, improving the ROUGE-L score for copyrighted text extraction from 0.38 to 0.47 (a 24% increase) on the EchoTrace benchmark.

Conclusion: RECAP effectively extracts and verifies memorized training data from LLMs, demonstrating its utility in scenarios where direct inspection of training data is not feasible.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Exploring multilingual data mixtures in LLM pretraining, the study finds no trade-off between language coverage and performance, debunking the 'curse of multilinguality' myth. Balanced data enhances capabilities without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of multilingual data mixtures on LLM pretraining and challenge common assumptions about trade-offs between language coverage and performance.

Method: Training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400, and analyzing the role of English as a pivot language.

Result: No performance degradation when combining English and multilingual data if languages have sufficient tokens. English as a pivot language benefits all language families. No significant 'curse of multilinguality' observed.

Conclusion: Balanced multilingual data can enhance LLM capabilities without compromising performance, even in low-resource settings, challenging common beliefs about multilinguality.

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how cultural alignment impacts sentiment preservation in Machine Translation (MT), revealing label drift due to cultural divergence, especially with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored role of cultural alignment in MT, particularly how cultural divergence affects semantic label fidelity during translation.

Method: The authors conducted experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains, comparing MT systems (including LLMs) to analyze label drift and cultural knowledge encoding.

Result: Key findings include label drift in culturally sensitive domains, LLMs amplifying drift due to encoded cultural knowledge, and cultural similarity being crucial for label preservation.

Conclusion: Neglecting cultural factors in MT risks label fidelity and cultural conflict, emphasizing the need for cultural alignment in translation systems.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode is a neurosymbolic framework that improves LLMs' mathematical reasoning by generating verifiable code using SymPy, achieving higher accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLMs' struggles with complex mathematical reasoning and unreliable solutions.

Method: Reframes problem-solving as verifiable code generation using SymPy.

Result: Achieves up to 13.6 percentage points accuracy improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: SymCode enhances accuracy and trustworthiness in AI for formal domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces optimized techniques for matrix multiplication (matmul) on AWS's Trainium AI accelerator, achieving significant speedups for LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium's systolic array architecture and data layout requirements pose challenges for high-performance LLM training and inference.

Method: The authors design a high-performance matmul kernel using kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to minimize data movement and maximize SRAM bandwidth.

Result: Their system achieves an average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x) for matmul kernels and an average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly improve performance for LLM inference on Trainium, outperforming AWS's state-of-the-art implementation.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnCache accelerates the prefill stage of LLM inference by reusing similar attention maps, reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many workloads rely on the prefill stage of LLM inference, where self-attention's quadratic complexity is a bottleneck.

Method: Proposes AttnCache, which caches and reuses similar attention maps using efficient retrieval techniques.

Result: Achieves speedups of 1.2x-1.6x end-to-end and 2x-3x for attention computation on CPU/GPU with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: AttnCache effectively reduces computational overhead in LLM prefill stages without significant accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL) to improve multi-step reasoning in small LLMs, combining expert-guided supervision with flexible reasoning, outperforming SFT and RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of SFT (overfitting) and RLVR (ineffective sampling) in training LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: SRL trains models to generate internal reasoning before actions, using step-wise rewards based on expert actions from SFT data.

Result: SRL enables small models to solve previously unlearnable tasks, with further performance gains when combined with RLVR.

Conclusion: SRL is a robust, versatile framework for reasoning tasks, applicable beyond benchmarks to agentic software engineering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool introduces an RL method to enhance tool-use LLMs by encouraging exploration of multiple trajectories and using step-wise rewards for training, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs trained on static datasets fail to explore dynamic solutions in tool-use environments, limiting their performance.

Method: PORTool uses RL to generate multiple rollouts per query, forming tree-like structures, assigns step-wise rewards, and trains LLMs using fork-relative and trajectory-relative advantages.

Result: Experiments with 17 tools show PORTool improves accuracy and reduces tool-call steps compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: PORTool effectively enhances LLM performance in dynamic tool-use environments by leveraging exploration and step-wise rewards.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between cross-lingual alignment (CLA) and cultural erasure in LLMs, proposing a new evaluation framework and a method to balance knowledge transfer and cultural localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unintended consequence of cultural erasure in CLA, where multilingual representations may lose culturally-specific nuances.

Method: Introduces the transfer-localization plane for evaluation and Surgical Steering, an inference-time method targeting specific model layers to optimize both knowledge transfer and cultural localization.

Result: Current CLA approaches improve factual transfer but reduce cultural localization. Surgical Steering achieves better balance between these goals.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for nuanced CLA techniques and demonstrates the effectiveness of layer-specific steering to mitigate cultural erasure.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: A study used NLP to analyze ITFs in radiology reports, finding them common and linked to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the prevalence, features, and clinical impact of incidental thyroid findings detected in non-thyroid imaging.

Method: Retrospective cohort study using a transformer-based NLP pipeline to identify ITFs in radiology reports from multiple modalities.

Result: 7.8% of patients had ITFs, mostly nodules, leading to higher odds of thyroid cancer diagnosis and procedures.

Conclusion: ITFs contribute to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, highlighting the need for standardized reporting and selective follow-up.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCoder Benchmark evaluates LLMs on quantum programming using a simulator and real contest codes, showing advanced models like GPT-4o struggle (18.97% accuracy), while reasoning-based models like o3 excel (78%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in evaluating LLMs for quantum programming, a domain requiring interaction with hardware, by introducing a benchmark with simulated feedback and human-written code comparisons.

Method: The QCoder Benchmark uses a quantum simulator to provide feedback on domain-specific metrics (e.g., circuit depth, execution time) and incorporates real human-written code submissions for qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Result: GPT-4o achieves only 18.97% accuracy, while reasoning-based models like o3 reach 78% accuracy, surpassing human-written code averages (39.98%).

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the challenges of quantum programming for LLMs and demonstrates the superiority of reasoning-based approaches. The dataset and API are released to foster further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

### [92] [Reasoning Path Divergence: A New Metric and Curation Strategy to Unlock LLM Diverse Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26122)
*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'one problem, multiple solutions' (1PNS) training to enhance reasoning diversity in LLMs, addressing the limitation of 'one problem, one solution' (1P1S). It proposes Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD) to measure semantic differences in reasoning paths and shows improved model performance (+2.80% pass@16).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome low output diversity caused by the 1P1S training paradigm, which limits reasoning paths, the paper aims to expose models to varied valid solutions.

Method: The 1PNS paradigm is introduced, using RPD to measure and maximize reasoning path diversity. Models (e.g., Qwen3-4B-Base) are fine-tuned with RPD-selected diverse solutions.

Result: Experiments show increased output diversity and performance gains (+2.80% pass@16, +4.99% on AIME24) compared to 1P1S baselines.

Conclusion: 1PNS training, supported by RPD, effectively enhances reasoning diversity and performance in LLMs, amplifying the benefits of Test-Time Scaling (TTS).

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

### [93] [On the Influence of Discourse Relations in Persuasive Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26124)
*Nawar Turk,Sevag Kaspar,Leila Kosseim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how Persuasion Techniques (PTs) and Discourse Relations (DRs) interact using LLMs and prompt engineering, identifying key DRs in persuasive texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of DRs in PTs for detecting propaganda and improving communication.

Method: Used SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset, developed LLM-based classifiers for DRs, and created silver datasets via majority-pooling.

Result: Identified six critical DRs (Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, Condition) linked to specific PTs.

Conclusion: Findings aid propaganda detection and enhance understanding of persuasive communication.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDM LMs fine-tune pre-trained Transformer LMs with a similarity-distance-magnitude activation layer for better instruction-following and reduced abstentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the statistical efficiency and reduce abstentions in language models by fine-tuning them with a novel SDM activation layer.

Method: Fine-tune pre-trained decoder-only Transformer LMs using supervised fine-tuning with an SDM activation layer and contrastive input encoding, including hard negative examples generated during training.

Result: SDM LMs achieve reduced abstentions and improved statistical efficiency compared to strong supervised baselines.

Conclusion: SDM LMs effectively enhance instruction-following capabilities and statistical efficiency in language models.

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

### [95] [RCScore: Quantifying Response Consistency in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26193)
*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore is a framework evaluating how instruction styles affect LLM performance, revealing significant accuracy variations and introducing Cross-Response Similarity (CRS) as a reliability proxy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations often miss the impact of instruction style, which is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: RCScore transforms benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles and introduces CRS to measure stylistic self-consistency.

Result: Instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7%, deterministic decoding improves stability, and model scale enhances consistency.

Conclusion: RCScore provides a robust method to assess instruction sensitivity, with CRS offering a valuable proxy for model reliability.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses 'update forgetting' in diffusion language models (DLMs) and proposes Token Timestep Allocation (TTA) for better controllability and fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs suffer from 'update forgetting,' where uniform updates disrupt refinement, degrading fluency and coherence.

Method: Proposes TTA for soft token ordering via timestep schedules, freezing critical tokens early and refining uncertain ones.

Result: TTA improves accuracy (+20%), halves perplexity, reduces toxicity (12.2 vs. 14.5), and lowers perplexity (26.0 vs. 32.0).

Conclusion: Soft token ordering via TTA mitigates update forgetting, enabling stable and controllable DLM text generation.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Tingshuo Fan,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GlobalQA, the first benchmark for evaluating global RAG capabilities, and proposes GlobalRAG, a framework that improves performance on global tasks like counting and sorting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG benchmarks focus on localized understanding, but real-world applications require global RAG capabilities to analyze information across entire document collections.

Method: The authors introduce GlobalQA for evaluation and propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool framework with chunk-level retrieval, LLM-driven filters, and aggregation modules.

Result: GlobalRAG achieves a 6.63 F1 score on Qwen2.5-14B, significantly outperforming the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the need for global RAG evaluation and validates GlobalRAG's effectiveness in addressing this challenge.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using pragmatic theories as prompts improves language models' ability to understand implied meanings, boosting performance by up to 9.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing language models' capability to interpret implied meanings, crucial for human-like communication.

Method: Providing pragmatic theories (e.g., Gricean pragmatics, Relevance Theory) as prompts guides models through step-by-step reasoning.

Result: Performance improved by up to 9.6% compared to baseline; even mentioning theory names boosted performance (~1-3%) in larger models.

Conclusion: Pragmatic theories as prompts effectively enhance language models' pragmatic reasoning.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

*Mérilin Sousa Silva,Sina Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pretrained language models struggle to distinguish loanwords from native vocabulary, despite contextual cues, highlighting biases in NLP systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether pretrained language models can identify loanwords similarly to bilingual speakers, especially in minority languages under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Method: Evaluated multiple pretrained language models across 10 languages using explicit instructions and contextual information.

Result: Models performed poorly in differentiating loanwords from native vocabulary, showing a bias toward loanwords.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize biases in NLP systems and underscore implications for developing tools for minority languages and language preservation.

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how knowledge distillation (KD) affects multilingual performance in vision-language models (VLMs), highlighting trade-offs between model size reduction and cross-lingual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uneven multilingual performance in VLMs, especially after model compression, and explore KD's role in maintaining robustness.

Method: Empirical study of five KD approaches applied to CLIP and SigLIP2, evaluated on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual QA tasks.

Result: Some KD configurations maintain or improve multilingual robustness despite model size reduction, while others fail to preserve cross-task stability.

Conclusion: KD design choices significantly impact multilingual performance, revealing trade-offs not captured by aggregate accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

*Kang Chen,Yaoning Wang,Kai Xiong,Zhuoka Feng,Wenhe Sun,Haotian Chen,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), an unsupervised method leveraging internal neuron activations for ensemble decoding, outperforming external signal-based methods and reducing token usage by 99%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: External signals like token probabilities or self-evaluations are poorly calibrated post-training, prompting exploration of richer internal neuron activations for better reasoning guidance.

Method: NAD selects candidates based on activation sparsity and cross-sample neuron agreement, operating solely on internal signals without relying on textual outputs.

Result: NAD matches majority voting on verifiable benchmarks and outperforms Avg@64 on open-ended coding tasks, enabling early stopping and reducing token usage significantly.

Conclusion: Internal neuron activations provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label-free ensemble decoding, surpassing traditional external signal methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

TL;DR: LLMs develop similar, accurate number representations despite errors, enabling universal probes to trace errors to specific layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflict between LLMs' accurate input embeddings for numbers and their erroneous numeric outputs.

Method: Explore how LLMs manipulate numbers, quantify accuracy bounds, and create universal probes.

Result: LLMs learn systematic, accurate, and interchangeable number representations across hidden states.

Conclusion: Findings provide fundamental insights into LLMs' numeric manipulation and suggest improved probing techniques.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: Atlas excels in logical tasks like Sudoku but struggles in real-time games due to timing and motor control challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate Atlas's web interaction capabilities, particularly in dynamic environments like browser games.

Method: Assessed Atlas using browser games (T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird, Stein.world) with in-game scores as metrics.

Result: Strong performance in logical reasoning (Sudoku), but poor in real-time games requiring precise timing.

Conclusion: Atlas has analytical strengths but faces limitations in dynamic, real-time web interactions.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

TL;DR: SCRIBE is a small, open-source framework for generating pedagogically valid feedback in education, addressing privacy, resource, and quality challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome privacy concerns, computational limitations, and the need for accurate educational feedback in language models.

Method: Develops SCRIBE, a multi-hop, tool-augmented reasoning framework, distilled into 3B and 8B models via LoRA fine-tuning on GPT-4o-generated data.

Result: 8B-SCRIBE models match or outperform larger models in relevance and actionability, while being comparable to GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B in student evaluations.

Conclusion: SCRIBE proves viable for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Result: ACER improves accuracy by 5 points in microeconomics, 3 points macro-average in target domains, and 0.7 points in non-target domains, while enhancing benchmarks like ARC and GPQA.

Conclusion: ACER provides a scalable solution to bridge domain gaps in LLMs, improving specialized performance without compromising general reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

*Mykhailo Poliakov,Nadiya Shvai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MisSynth, a pipeline using synthetic data generation and fine-tuning to improve LLMs' ability to detect health-related misinformation, showing significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health-related misinformation is widespread and harmful but hard to identify, especially when it distorts scientific findings. The paper aims to enhance LLMs' capability to recognize such misinformation.

Method: The authors introduce MisSynth, a pipeline combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for synthetic fallacy samples and lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3.1 8B) using the MISSCI dataset.

Result: Fine-tuned models achieved substantial improvements, e.g., a 35% F1-score absolute gain over baselines. Synthetic data augmented limited annotated resources, enhancing zero-shot classification performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation and fine-tuning significantly boost LLMs' misinformation detection, even with limited computational resources. The code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using pretrained and large language models for discourse relation classification in scientific texts, highlighting the benefits of context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support AI-generated scientific claims by leveraging discourse-level information.

Method: Investigates pretrained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) for discourse relation classification (DRC) in scientific publications.

Result: Context, defined by discourse structure, generally aids DRC. The study identifies specific discourse relation types that benefit most from context.

Conclusion: Discourse context is valuable for DRC in scientific writing, with certain relation types showing greater improvements.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

*Min Zhang,Hao Chen,Hao Chen,Wenqi Zhang,Didi Zhu,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Aimin Zhou,Fei Wu,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniEduBench is a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark addressing gaps in LLM evaluation by measuring both knowledge and cultivation dimensions across diverse subjects and question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs and benchmarks focus mainly on knowledge, neglecting cultivation capabilities essential for real-world education, especially in the Chinese context.

Method: OmniEduBench includes 24.602K high-quality QA pairs divided into knowledge (18.121K) and cultivation (6.481K) dimensions, further categorized into 61 subjects and 11 question types.

Result: Experiments on 11 LLMs show performance gaps, with only Gemini-2.5 Pro scoring above 60% in knowledge and QWQ trailing humans by 30% in cultivation.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights significant challenges for LLMs in education, emphasizing the need for improvement in both knowledge and cultivation capabilities.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSLC combines sparse optimization and low-rank approximation to compress LLMs efficiently, achieving top performance without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth and computational demands limit LLM adoption, and the synergy of pruning and low-rank methods is underexplored.

Method: SSLC unifies low-rank approximation and sparse optimization, solved via iterative optimization.

Result: SSLC compresses models by 50% with no performance loss and delivers 1.63x speedup.

Conclusion: SSLC provides an effective solution for deploying LLMs efficiently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

*Rasoul Amirzadeh,Dhananjay Thiruvady,Fatemeh Shiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework to improve transparency, consistency, and accuracy in sentiment analysis by probabilistically integrating predictions from multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain-specific LLMs face issues like lack of transparency, high fine-tuning costs, inconsistent results, and environmental impact, prompting the development of BNLF.

Method: BNLF integrates predictions from FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet using a probabilistic Bayesian network for late fusion in sentiment analysis.

Result: Evaluated on three financial corpora, BNLF achieves consistent accuracy gains of about 6% over baseline LLMs.

Conclusion: BNLF demonstrates robustness to dataset variability and proves effective for interpretable sentiment classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An ensemble of LLMs outperforms a single LLM in evaluating a clinical AI triage tool for intracranial hemorrhage detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if multiple LLMs collectively provide more reliable assessments than a single LLM for evaluating AI triage tools.

Method: 29,766 CT head exams were analyzed using eight open-source LLMs and GPT-4o. Performance was compared against manual reviews.

Result: Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o showed the highest performance metrics. Ensembles of LLMs were more consistent and reliable than single LLMs.

Conclusion: Ensembles of medium to large open-source LLMs offer a reliable method for retrospective evaluation of clinical AI tools.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG framework improves knowledge graph construction from legal texts by reducing node duplication and noise through coreference resolution and structured prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are hard to analyze due to unstructured legal documents. Traditional methods produce noisy graphs, prompting the need for better solutions.

Method: CORE-KG integrates type-aware coreference resolution and domain-guided structured prompts to enhance KG construction.

Result: Coreference resolution reduces node duplication by 28.32% and noise by 4.32%; structured prompts cut duplication by 4.34% and noise by 73.33%.

Conclusion: CORE-KG's components significantly improve KG quality, offering insights for robust legal text analysis pipelines.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

*Yair Elboher,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVRIT is a novel system for Hebrew diacritization that uses a zero-shot classification approach and a Hebrew Visual Language Model, achieving high accuracy without complex linguistic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is crucial for accurate word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning, especially given the language's ambiguity when unvocalized.

Method: DIVRIT frames diacritization as a zero-shot classification problem, selecting diacritization patterns dynamically based on context. It uses a Hebrew Visual Language Model to process text as images for embedding diacritic information.

Result: In an 'oracle' setting, DIVRIT achieves high accuracy. Architectural enhancements and optimized training improve its generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Visual representations show promise for accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends single-relation linear operator findings to multiple relations in transformer language models, revealing their compressibility via tensor networks and property-based structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linear operators decode relational facts in transformers and explore their organization across multiple relations.

Method: Extends single-relation analysis to collections, uses tensor networks for compression, and develops a cross-evaluation protocol to test semantic properties.

Result: Linear decoders are highly compressible and encode recurring semantic properties rather than distinct relations, explaining their generalization limits.

Conclusion: Relational decoding in transformers is property-based, not relation-specific, clarifying compressibility and generalization behavior.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

*Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu,Ziyi Xia,Shitao Xiao,Siqi Bao,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoFlow, a framework addressing low Reward Density in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by decomposing tasks, providing corrective hints, and using dual-agent refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low Reward Density hinders RLVR's effectiveness in deep search scenarios, prompting the need for optimization solutions.

Method: InfoFlow decomposes tasks, provides failure-guided hints, and employs dual-agent refinement to enhance reward density.

Result: InfoFlow outperforms baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to match advanced proprietary LLMs' performance.

Conclusion: InfoFlow effectively improves reward density and performance in RLVR applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

TL;DR: CAST introduces a dynamic tree decoding approach for LLMs, optimizing inference costs like GPU configurations and batch sizes, achieving up to 5.2x speedup and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 5-20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inference latency challenges in LLMs caused by autoregressive design and large size, with a focus on overlooked system variables like GPU devices and batch sizes.

Method: Proposes CAST, a dynamic tree decoding method that refines tree structures by considering inference costs (e.g., GPU configurations, batch sizes) for simultaneous token generation and validation.

Result: Achieves speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5-20% across six diverse tasks and six distinct LLMs.

Conclusion: CAST effectively reduces LLM inference latency by dynamically optimizing tree structures, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlideAgent is a framework for understanding multi-page visual documents like slide decks, using specialized agents for multi-level reasoning (global, page, element). It outperforms proprietary and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems struggle with fine-grained reasoning over complex, multi-page visual documents, despite LLMs' potential in document understanding.

Method: SlideAgent decomposes reasoning into global, page, and element levels, employing specialized agents to construct structured representations. It selectively activates agents during inference.

Result: SlideAgent improves performance by +7.9 over proprietary models and +9.8 over open-source models.

Conclusion: SlideAgent effectively addresses challenges in multi-page document understanding through specialized multi-level reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits encoder-decoder LLMs (RedLLM) enhanced with recent decoder-only LLM techniques, showing competitive scaling and performance with better inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns that encoder-decoder models may be overlooked due to the dominance of decoder-only models, the study aims to rigorously compare the two architectures from a scaling perspective.

Method: Pretrains RedLLM with prefix LM and DecLLM with causal LM, comparing them at scales from ~150M to ~8B parameters using RedPajama V1 and FLAN datasets.

Result: RedLLM shows compelling scaling, comparable context length extrapolation, and better inference efficiency after instruction tuning, achieving competitive or superior downstream task performance.

Conclusion: The findings suggest encoder-decoder models (RedLLM) deserve re-examination for developing efficient and powerful LLMs.

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evontree leverages ontology rules to enhance domain-specific knowledge in LLMs without extensive external datasets, improving accuracy in specialized applications like healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of high-quality, domain-specific training data for LLMs in sensitive fields like healthcare by utilizing existing ontology rules.

Method: Proposes Evontree, which extracts domain ontology, detects inconsistencies with ontology rules, and refines knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 3.7% accuracy improvement on medical QA benchmarks compared to unmodified models and supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Evontree is effective, efficient, and robust for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture introducing Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), outperforming full attention across various scenarios with improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of full attention architectures by proposing a more efficient and effective linear attention module (KDA) for diverse tasks.

Method: Develops KDA, extending Gated DeltaNet with finer-grained gating, and uses a chunkwise algorithm with specialized DPLR matrices for hardware efficiency. Hybridizes KDA with Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) in a 3B-parameter model.

Result: Outperforms full MLA across tasks, reduces KV cache usage by 75%, and achieves 6x decoding throughput for 1M context.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear serves as a superior drop-in replacement for full attention, combining performance and efficiency, with open-source resources provided.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

*Zhichao Wang,Dongyang Ma,Xinting Huang,Deng Cai,Tian Lan,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Xiaoying Tang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco introduces a novel architecture for truly end-to-end generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy dynamically, outperforming traditional methods and enabling instruction-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on non-differentiable decoding processes requiring manual hyperparameter tuning, which AutoDeco addresses by automating this through context-specific predictions.

Method: AutoDeco augments transformers with lightweight heads to dynamically predict temperature and top-p values alongside token logits, making decoding parametric and self-regulating.

Result: AutoDeco outperforms default decoding strategies and matches oracle-tuned baselines on eight benchmarks, while also enabling instruction-based control.

Conclusion: AutoDeco transforms decoding into a learnable, interactive process, offering a new paradigm for steerable LLM generation.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

### [122] [Value Drifts: Tracing Value Alignment During LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26707)
*Mehar Bhatia,Shravan Nayak,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Karolina Stańczak,Vered Shwartz,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs align with human values during post-training, focusing on training dynamics rather than just evaluating final models. It finds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily establishes values, while preference optimization rarely re-aligns them. Different algorithms yield varying alignment outcomes even with identical preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs learn human values during post-training is crucial for improving alignment, as prior work overlooks training dynamics and focuses on evaluating fully trained models.

Method: The study analyzes Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of various sizes, using SFT and preference optimization datasets/algorithms. A synthetic preference dataset allows controlled manipulation of values.

Result: SFT establishes a model's values, and preference optimization rarely re-aligns them. Different preference optimization algorithms lead to varying alignment outcomes, even with the same data.

Conclusion: The findings offer actionable insights for improving value alignment, guiding data curation, and selecting models/algorithms for preference optimization.

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench is a high-difficulty math benchmark with 50 original, expert-validated problems, designed to evaluate and push the limits of LLMs' mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation; AMO-Bench introduces harder problems to better evaluate and improve LLMs.

Method: Problems are cross-validated by experts to meet IMO standards and are original to prevent memorization. Only final answers are required for easy grading.

Result: Top-performing LLMs achieved only 52.4% accuracy, with most below 40%, but scaling trends with test-time compute show potential for improvement.

Conclusion: AMO-Bench highlights the need for advancing LLMs' mathematical reasoning and provides a tool for future research.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

TL;DR: Gistify is a task for coding LLMs to create minimal, self-contained files replicating specific functionalities of large codebases, highlighting their structural and execution flow understanding. Current models struggle with reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automatically evaluating coding agents in large codebases by designing a task that tests their ability to condense functionality.

Method: Proposing Gistify, where coding LLMs generate minimal files reproducing specific commands' outputs from full codebases, emphasizing essential components.

Result: State-of-the-art models find it difficult to reliably solve Gistify tasks, particularly those with long execution traces.

Conclusion: Gistify serves as a robust evaluation tool, revealing limitations in current coding LLMs' abilities to handle complex codebase functionalities.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: The study explores LLM agent behavior in realistic economic marketplaces, highlighting challenges like scalability and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLM agents mediate economic decisions in dynamic, real-world markets, addressing accountability and user value.

Method: Developed a simulated two-sided marketplace (Magentic-Marketplace) with Assistant (consumer) and Service (business) agents to study interactions.

Result: Frontier models achieve near-optimal welfare under ideal conditions, but performance declines with scale; all models show strong first-proposal bias favoring speed over quality.

Conclusion: The findings inform the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces by revealing emergent behaviors under varying conditions.

Abstract: As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions,
ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such
applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent
accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires
understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,
previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as
single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent
interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require
agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large,
dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in
open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic
marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents
represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop
Magentic-Marketplace-- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services
can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the
utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and
how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier
models can approach optimal welfare-- but only under ideal search conditions.
Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe
first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over
quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions,
informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

*Ziyi Wang,Carmine Ventre,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to study algorithmic collusion in market making, revealing insights into emergent interaction patterns and market efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI agents' interactions in markets might lead to collusion or dominance, and to explore the broader effects of emergent behaviors on market dynamics.

Method: A hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with a market maker (Agent A) and three competitor agents (B1, B2, B*) with varying objectives, analyzed using interaction-level metrics.

Result: Agent B2 dominates in zero-sum settings, improving market efficiency, while B* adapts to coexist sustainably with profit-seeking agents, exhibiting milder adverse effects.

Conclusion: Adaptive incentive control fosters sustainable co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments, providing a structured approach for evaluating algorithmic trading behavior.

Abstract: Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the
interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion?
More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market
dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important
research question.
  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to
study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a
self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain
environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the
self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the
competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),
and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the
other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and
affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify
behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals
potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.
  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a
zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening
average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast,
Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with
other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive
quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1
compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports
more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and
offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic
trading systems.

TL;DR: SupervisorAgent is a lightweight, modular framework for real-time adaptive supervision in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), reducing inefficiencies like excessive token usage and misinformation without altering base agent architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for MAS focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking proactive, real-time interventions to improve robustness and efficiency.

Method: SupervisorAgent uses an LLM-free adaptive filter to intervene during runtime, correcting errors, guiding inefficient behaviors, and purifying observations.

Result: On the GAIA benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduced token consumption by 29.45% without lowering success rates, validated across five additional benchmarks.

Conclusion: SupervisorAgent demonstrates broad applicability and robustness, enhancing MAS efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for
runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's
architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent
intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide
inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA
benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent
framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.
Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code
generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate
the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available

TL;DR: GIFF is a novel framework for fair multi-agent resource allocation, balancing efficiency and fairness using Q-functions without additional training. It outperforms baselines in various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inequitable outcomes in resource-constrained settings where efficiency-focused agents create unfairness.

Method: Uses Q-functions to compute local fairness gains and counterfactual advantage correction, formalized in centralized control with GIFF-modified Q-values.

Result: Empirical evaluations show GIFF outperforms baselines in fairness and efficiency across multiple domains.

Conclusion: GIFF is a robust framework leveraging standard RL components for equitable outcomes in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a
novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair
decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained
settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.
Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and
fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method
computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual
advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off
agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where
an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.
  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,
homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our
framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover
far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by
a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower
bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers
monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled
framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve
more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: The review systematically explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to MLPs, focusing on their theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of KANs, highlighting their superior parameter efficiency and interpretability over MLPs.

Method: Surveys various basis function choices and categorizes advancements in accuracy, efficiency, and regularization techniques.

Result: Maps the ecosystem of KAN development and offers a practical guide for selecting architectures.

Conclusion: Identifies research gaps and provides a structured reference for ongoing KAN research via an associated GitHub repository.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Navigation (AN) and Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN) for dynamic vehicle routing using MARL. AN uses decentralized agents at intersections, while HHAN scales by focusing on key hubs. Both reduce congestion and improve travel times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic congestion worsens trip times and emissions, especially during peak periods. Traditional routing methods like SPF perform poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle scenarios, often exacerbating congestion.

Method: AN employs decentralized MARL with Graph Attention Networks for local traffic modeling. HHAN extends AN by focusing on key hubs, using centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under A-QMIX for coordination.

Result: AN reduces average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines with 100% routing success. HHAN scales to large networks, achieving up to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic.

Conclusion: Network-constrained MARL, as demonstrated by AN and HHAN, offers scalable, coordinated, and congestion-aware routing, benefiting intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: To clarify the predictive utility of wearable sensor data by exploring how different temporal resolutions impact representation learning for clinical and behavioral outcomes.

Method: Introduces HiMAE, combining masked autoencoding with hierarchical convolutional encoder-decoder to produce multi-resolution embeddings.

Result: HiMAE outperforms state-of-the-art models across benchmarks, is efficient enough for smartwatch deployment, and provides interpretability by probing temporal scales.

Conclusion: HiMAE is both an efficient self-supervised learning method and a tool for discovering scale-sensitive structures in wearable health data.

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Motivation: The discovery of high-energy materials is limited by experimental data and testing access. This work aims to overcome these constraints with computational methods.

Method: Uses LSTM for molecular generation and GNN for property prediction, with a novel embedding strategy combining SHA-256 and trainable representations.

Result: Achieved 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty in generated molecules. Identified 37 new super explosives with high detonation velocity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively generates diverse and novel high-energy molecules, demonstrating potential for accelerating HEM discovery.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms by which transformers learn to follow and benefit from CoT supervision, which remains unclear despite its performance benefits.

Method: Pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with controllable data composition and algorithmic complexity, comparing training with and without CoT traces.

Result: CoT generally improves performance but depends on task complexity; a logistic curve models learning dynamics, and a transient trace unfaithfulness phase is observed before alignment.

Conclusion: CoT accelerates generalization but has limits with high algorithmic complexity; introduces a kinetic modeling framework and highlights CoT's mechanistic impact on transformer computation.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

### [134] [Optimal Information Combining for Multi-Agent Systems Using Adaptive Bias Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25793)
*Siavash M. Alamouti,Fay Arjomandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates when bias learning in multi-agent systems can improve performance, introducing a learnability ratio to guide decisions and presenting the ABLOC algorithm for bias correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic biases in multi-agent systems degrade performance, but current solutions are impractical. The paper aims to determine when bias learning is feasible and impactful.

Method: Develops a framework decomposing biases into learnable and stochastic parts, introduces the learnability ratio, and proposes the ABLOC algorithm for iterative bias correction.

Result: Systems with high learnability ratios achieve 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement, while low learnability systems show minimal benefits.

Conclusion: The learnability ratio provides a practical metric to decide when bias learning is worthwhile, and ABLOC algorithm effectively corrects biases where applicable.

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

### [135] [Non-myopic Matching and Rebalancing in Large-Scale On-Demand Ride-Pooling Systems Using Simulation-Informed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25796)
*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach for ride-pooling improves service rates, reduces wait and in-vehicle times, and decreases fleet size compared to myopic policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of myopic decision-making in ride-pooling by leveraging simulation-informed RL for long-term effects.

Method: Extends a ride-hailing RL framework to ride-pooling, using simulation and n-step temporal difference learning for non-myopic policies. Includes idle vehicle rebalancing.

Result: Non-myopic policy increases service rate by 8.4%, reduces wait and in-vehicle times, and cuts fleet size by over 25%. Rebalancing further improves wait times by 27.3%.

Conclusion: Proposed RL-based non-myopic approach enhances ride-pooling efficiency, offering cost savings and better performance compared to myopic policies.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

*Jin Seong,Jiyun Park,Wencke Liermann,Hongseok Choi,Yoonji Nam,Hyun Kim,Soojong Lim,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemEIC, a method for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in large vision-language models (LVLMs), addressing the limitations of single-modality editing by enabling sequential updates for both visual and textual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge editing techniques for LVLMs often focus on a single modality, neglecting the inherent multimodality and continuous nature of knowledge updates, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: MemEIC employs a hybrid external-internal editor with dual external memory for cross-modal retrieval and dual LoRA adapters for disentangled parameter updates. It includes a brain-inspired knowledge connector for compositional reasoning across modalities.

Result: Experiments show MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits.

Conclusion: MemEIC sets a new benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs by enabling compositional and continuous knowledge updates.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

*Jialong Sun,Xinpeng Ling,Jiaxuan Zou,Jiawen Kang,Kejia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses spectral bias in multivariate time series prediction, proposing the FreLE algorithm to mitigate it through frequency regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify understanding of spectral bias in models and improve long-term time series prediction.

Method: Conducted empirical experiments to measure spectral bias and developed the FreLE algorithm for explicit and implicit frequency regularization.

Result: Found spectral bias is universal; FreLE significantly improves model performance.

Conclusion: FreLE effectively mitigates spectral bias and enhances prediction accuracy.

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

### [138] [Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801)
*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits cold start in RL for vision-language models, proposing SPECS, a self-distilled, preference-based framework that improves generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT-based cold starts in RL for vision-language models suffer from overfitting and weak generalization, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: SPECS uses self-distilled preference data pairs and preference-based training to decouple multimodal learning, focusing on transferable criteria before RL.

Result: SPECS improves benchmarks like MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%, enhances exploration, and stabilizes training.

Conclusion: Preference-based cold start (SPECS) outperforms SFT-based methods, offering better generalization and higher performance in multimodal RL tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-POT is a sparse-activated architecture that efficiently scales parameters and reduces inference costs for solving PDEs, outperforming existing models with fewer activated parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity, performance limitations, and high inference costs in solving PDEs with neural operators due to dataset heterogeneity and dense pre-training models.

Method: Proposes Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT) with a layer-wise router-gating network to dynamically select experts, integrating shared experts for common properties.

Result: Achieves up to 40% reduction in zero-shot error with 90M activated parameters compared to existing models with 120M. Includes interpretability analysis validating the MoE architecture.

Conclusion: MoE-POT effectively balances parameter efficiency and performance, demonstrating significant improvements in PDE solving with interpretable results.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO optimizes instructions for black-box LLMs by leveraging the preimage structure of soft prompts, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the redundancy in instruction optimization for black-box LLMs caused by many-to-one mapping of soft prompts.

Method: PRESTO uses score sharing, preimage-based initialization, and score consistency regularization to leverage preimages for efficient optimization.

Result: PRESTO achieves 14 times more scored data under the same query budget and performs superiorly on 33 tasks.

Conclusion: PRESTO efficiently optimizes instructions for black-box LLMs by utilizing preimage structure, enhancing optimization performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff is a training-free framework that extends the resolution of pretrained diffusion models efficiently using Neighborhood Patch Attention and Latent Frequency Mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models degrade in performance when generating images beyond their training resolution. Existing training-free methods are either computationally expensive or incompatible with newer models.

Method: Proposes ScaleDiff with Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA) to reduce redundancy in self-attention layers, integrates NPA into an SDEdit pipeline, and introduces Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM) for finer details. Also uses Structure Guidance for better global structure.

Result: ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality and inference speed for training-free methods on both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff offers an efficient, model-agnostic solution for high-resolution image generation without additional training.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: πRL is a framework for training flow-based VLAs using RL, addressing challenges like intractable action log-likelihoods. It outperforms SFT models significantly in benchmarks like LIBERO and ManiSkill.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of applying large-scale RL to flow-based VLAs due to intractable action log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.

Method: The framework (πRL) uses two RL algorithms: Flow-Noise (models denoising as a discrete-time MDP) and Flow-SDE (integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction via ODE-to-SDE conversion).

Result: πRL boosts performance of SFT models from 57.6% to 97.6% (LIBERO) and 41.6% to 85.7% (ManiSkill), demonstrating scalable multitask RL.

Conclusion: πRL validates the effectiveness of online RL for flow-based VLAs, achieving significant performance gains and stronger generalization over SFT models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

TL;DR: A graph-topological approach for active learning using Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) to optimize exploration-exploitation trade-offs under limited labels, with improved label propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation in active learning with scarce label budgets.

Method: Uses BFC for coreset construction to select representative initial labels, includes a data-driven stopping criterion, and employs localized graph rewiring for better label propagation.

Result: Outperforms existing graph-based semi-supervised methods in benchmark classification tasks at low label rates.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively tackles the exploration-exploitation trade-off and enhances label propagation in sparse label scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

TL;DR: A method for estimating causal effects in multi-domain settings with unobserved confounders, leveraging proxies and proving identifiability even for continuous variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of estimating causal effects when confounders are hidden and vary across domains, using proxy variables.

Method: Proposes two estimation techniques assuming discrete/categorical variables and proves their consistency and identifiability.

Result: Demonstrates theoretical identifiability and consistent estimation, validated through simulations and a real-world example.

Conclusion: Effective causal effect estimation is achievable even with hidden confounders using proxies, supported by robust theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active learning with fixed unsupervised representations struggles with messy datasets. Task-driven representations, updated during learning, improve performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning can be ineffective with messy datasets if representations fail to capture task-relevant information.

Method: Proposes two strategies: semi-supervised representation learning and supervised fine-tuning of unsupervised representations.

Result: Both strategies outperform unsupervised or pretrained representations.

Conclusion: Updating representations during active learning enhances effectiveness for messy datasets.

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvGNN-WM introduces a trigger-free watermarking method for GNNs tied to graph invariants, ensuring robustness against common edits and maintaining clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN watermarks use backdoor triggers, which are fragile under model edits and create ownership ambiguity. InvGNN-WM aims to address these limitations.

Method: The method uses a lightweight head to predict graph invariants on owner-private carrier sets, with a sign-sensitive decoder and calibrated threshold for verification.

Result: InvGNN-WM maintains clean accuracy while outperforming baselines in watermark accuracy. It resists pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization but weakens under plain KD unless KD+WM is used.

Conclusion: InvGNN-WM provides imperceptible, robust watermarking for GNNs, with proven NP-completeness for exact removal, making it a reliable solution.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

Conclusion: MLT provides efficient, scalable, and reversible encoding for high-cardinality categorical data, with an open-source implementation available.

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and

encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

*Alvaro Velasquez,Susmit Jha,Ismail R. Alkhouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey of neural networks for optimization in training-data-free settings, focusing on re-parameterization using various architectures, motivations, and comparisons with related concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the underdevelopment of data-driven learning and limited training data availability in fields like combinatorial optimization and medical imaging.

Method: Examines dataless applications of MLP, convolutional, graph, and quadratic neural networks, categorizing them into architecture-agnostic and architecture-specific methods.

Result: Highlights promising results in diverse applications, including combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial differential equations.

Conclusion: Clarifies distinctions between dataless neural networks and related concepts like zero-shot learning and over-parameterization.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

### [150] [Contrastive Predictive Coding Done Right for Mutual Information Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25983)
*J. Jon Ryu,Pavan Yeddanapudi,Xiangxiang Xu,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques InfoNCE as a flawed mutual information (MI) estimator, proposes InfoNCE-anchor for better MI estimation, and finds it doesn't improve downstream task performance despite better MI estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of InfoNCE as a mutual information estimator and explore whether accurate MI estimation improves contrastive representation learning.

Method: Introduces InfoNCE-anchor, an auxiliary anchor class for consistent density ratio estimation, and generalizes the framework using proper scoring rules.

Result: InfoNCE-anchor reduces bias in MI estimation but doesn't enhance downstream task performance, suggesting contrastive learning benefits from structured density ratios, not accurate MI estimates.

Conclusion: Accurate MI estimation isn't crucial for contrastive representation learning; learning structured density ratios is more beneficial.

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

*Andrew W. Rosemberg,Joaquim Dias Garcia,François Pacaud,Robert B. Parker,Benoît Legat,Kaarthik Sundar,Russell Bent,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Julia-based framework (DiffOpt.jl) for differentiating through constrained optimization problems, unifying modeling and differentiation while supporting both forward and reverse-mode sensitivities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of integrating differentiation in optimization for learning, control, and decision-making systems due to solver specialization and interface mismatches motivates this work.

Method: The framework differentiates the KKT system under standard regularity assumptions, offering a JuMP-native API for parameter-centric derivatives.

Result: It successfully applies to convex and nonconvex models, including economic dispatch, portfolio selection, and robot kinematics, and supports large-scale applications like energy markets and optimization proxies.

Conclusion: Differentiable optimization becomes a practical tool for experimentation and learning without compromising standard modeling practices or solver access.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

*Darius Masoum Zadeh-Jousdani,Elvin Hajizada,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCN-TA reduces computational overhead for robotic edge systems by leveraging temporal correlations in PC networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient online learning for robotic systems at the edge requires biologically plausible algorithms that can adapt continuously.

Method: PCN-TA preserves latent states across temporal frames to reduce computational demands.

Result: PCN-TA achieves 10% fewer weight updates than backpropagation and 50% fewer inference steps than baseline PC.

Conclusion: PCN-TA offers efficiency gains for edge deployment and potential for neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

### [153] [Infrequent Exploration in Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26000)
*Harin Lee,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INFEX bridges the gap between continuous exploration and purely greedy methods in linear bandits, achieving provably efficient regret with infrequent exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either explore too frequently (costly/unethical) or rely on stringent diversity assumptions (limiting applicability).

Method: INFEX combines a base exploratory policy with scheduled exploration and greedy actions, integrating adaptive methods modularly.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show INFEX matches standard algorithms' regret while improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: INFEX offers a practical, efficient solution for infrequent exploration in linear bandits, with broad application potential.

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: A dual mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework is proposed for discrete-time survival analysis, improving performance on breast cancer datasets by modeling patient heterogeneity and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling patient heterogeneity and adapting risk predictions to individual characteristics and temporal dynamics in survival analysis.

Method: Introduces a dual-MoE framework combining feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation learning and hazard MoE leveraging patient features and time embeddings.

Result: Boosts the time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on METABRIC and GBSG datasets, with further gains when integrated into Consurv.

Conclusion: The dual-MoE design effectively integrates with existing survival pipelines and improves predictive performance.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

TL;DR: AI chess models mimic human concepts early but develop alien representations in deeper layers, relying on memorization rather than true understanding. Chess960 tests reveal performance diverges from human-like reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI systems genuinely understand human concepts or just mimic patterns, using chess as a testbed for creativity and strategy.

Method: Analyze a 270M-parameter transformer's layer-wise representations, introduce Chess960 dataset with randomized openings, and measure concept recognition accuracy.

Result: Early layers align with human concepts (85% accuracy), but deeper layers drift (50-65%). Chess960 shows 10-20% drop in recognition, indicating memorization dependency.

Conclusion: AI optimizes for performance with representations divergent from human thinking, posing challenges for human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

*Jiali Cheng,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation (KD) undermines debiasing capabilities in models, with variations across bias types. Attention patterns cause distinct post-KD behavior. Proposed solutions include high-quality data augmentation, iterative KD, and teacher-initialized student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how KD affects debiasing capabilities in models, particularly robustness against spurious correlations in out-of-distribution data, which is underexplored.

Method: Extensive experiments were conducted on natural language inference (NLI) and image classification tasks to analyze KD's impact on debiasing and internal attention patterns.

Result: Key findings include undermined debiasing post-KD, no benefit from teacher knowledge for debiased models, robustness variations across biases, and identified attention patterns causing distinct behavior.

Conclusion: The study proposes three solutions for improving debiasing distillability and provides insights into KD's impact on debiasing mechanisms.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic regression (SR) leverages deep learning and scaling laws to improve performance with predictable trends based on compute resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scaling laws in SR, inspired by language modeling, aiming to enhance model performance and interpretability.

Method: Uses a scalable transformer pipeline and carefully generated training data, testing five model sizes across three orders of compute magnitude.

Result: Validation loss and solved rate follow power-law trends with compute; optimal hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate) scale with model size.

Conclusion: SR performance is predictable from compute, providing insights for future SR model training.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning paradigm treats models as malleable geometric entities, optimizing metric tensors on manifolds for dynamic model-space shaping, combining data fidelity and geometric regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To surpass traditional parameter optimization by dynamically shaping model geometry, enhancing expressive power and preventing overfitting.

Method: Constructs a variational framework balancing data fidelity and geometric complexity, using discrete differential geometry (triangular mesh) for practical optimization.

Result: Metric optimization yields greater expressive power than fixed-geometry models, with theoretical ties to general relativity's Einstein-Hilbert action.

Conclusion: This paradigm enables dynamic meta-learners with evolving geometry/topology, promising applications in scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

TL;DR: A systematic review of synthetic financial data generation highlights dominant GAN-based methods for time-series and tabular data, noting gaps in privacy evaluation and calling for more rigorous safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and regulatory challenges in using sensitive financial data for machine learning by leveraging synthetic data generation.

Method: Analyzes 72 studies (since 2018) categorizing financial data types, generative methods (e.g., GANs, VAEs), and evaluation strategies for utility and privacy.

Result: GANs dominate, especially for time-series and credit data, but privacy evaluation lacks rigor despite promising techniques.

Conclusion: Identifies research gaps and guides future work towards robust, privacy-preserving synthetic financial data solutions.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nirvana, a Specialized Generalist Model (SGM), integrates task-aware memory mechanisms (Trigger and Updater) for adaptive performance across general and specialized tasks, outperforming traditional LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs lack specialized memory mechanisms guided by task information, limiting their adaptability and performance in target domains.

Method: Nirvana employs Trigger for task-aware parameter adjustment and Updater for dynamic context memorization, enabling adaptive performance.

Result: Nirvana excels in general language tasks and specialized medical tasks (e.g., MRI reconstruction), outperforming traditional models.

Conclusion: Nirvana's task-aware memory mechanisms enhance both general and specialized performance, proving effective for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-stage pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve bug bisection accuracy by leveraging both code and textual data, outperforming traditional methods by over 38%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bug bisection methods face limitations like assuming bug-inducing and patch commits modify the same functions and relying on simple heuristics. LLMs can break these barriers by analyzing both code and text.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline employing LLMs to utilize patch information fully, compare candidate commits contextually, and progressively narrow down candidates through down-selection steps.

Result: The approach achieves over 38% better accuracy than state-of-the-art solutions and 60% improvement over baseline LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based pipeline significantly enhances bug bisection accuracy, demonstrating the importance of comprehensive multi-stage analysis.

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

TL;DR: SAFE is a tool for analyzing AI weather models by stratifying performance across geospatial attributes like countries, income, and landcover, revealing disparities in forecasting skill.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML evaluations average performance globally, ignoring geographic and human development disparities. SAFE addresses this gap.

Method: SAFE integrates diverse data domains to stratify predictions by attributes (e.g., country, income) and benchmarks model performance per stratum.

Result: State-of-the-art AI weather models show varied performance across strata, highlighting disparities. SAFE enables fairness benchmarking.

Conclusion: SAFE provides a stratified approach to evaluate model fairness and performance, moving beyond global averages.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

*Chenming Tang,Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Weijie Liu,Saiyong Yang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR boosts LLM reasoning but faces exploration stagnation. LTE, leveraging self-generated incorrect answers, outperforms GRPO without external expert guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address exploration stagnation in RLVR for LLMs without relying on external experts.

Method: Propose LTE, using self-generated incorrect answers and overlong responses to guide LLM training.

Result: LTE outperforms GRPO by 6.38 in Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k across six math benchmarks.

Conclusion: LTE effectively mitigates exploration stagnation and enhances LLM training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

*Kexing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: maxVSTAR is a vision-guided framework that autonomously adapts CSI-based HAR models to mitigate domain shifts, improving accuracy on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift hinders CSI-based HAR performance in varying environments. maxVSTAR aims to enable autonomous adaptation without manual intervention.

Method: Uses a YOLO-based vision model as a teacher to fine-tune a lightweight CSI model (STAR) online, leveraging cross-modal signals.

Result: After adaptation, accuracy improved from 49.14% to 81.51% on uncalibrated hardware, showcasing effective self-supervised adaptation.

Conclusion: maxVSTAR offers a scalable solution for long-term, autonomous HAR in privacy-conscious IoT environments.

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAR is an edge-AI-optimized framework for real-time Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Wi-Fi CSI, featuring lightweight neural architecture and adaptive signal processing for efficient deployment on low-power devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR methods suffer from computational inefficiency and high latency, limiting feasibility in resource-constrained mobile edge environments.

Conclusion: STAR offers a scalable, real-time, privacy-preserving HAR solution suitable for mobile and pervasive computing environments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

*Hyuntae Park,Yeachan Kim,SangKeun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolBridge introduces substructure-aware alignment and contrastive learning to improve molecule-text representation, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to capture fine-grained alignments between molecules and their descriptions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: MolBridge augments molecule-description pairs with substructure-phrase alignment signals and uses substructure-aware contrastive learning with a self-refinement mechanism.

Result: MolBridge achieves superior performance on molecular benchmarks by capturing fine-grained correspondences.

Conclusion: Substructure-aware alignment is crucial for advancing molecule-text learning, as demonstrated by MolBridge's success.

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of advanced feature engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in multivariate industrial time series.

Method: Evaluated impact of change point-derived statistical features, clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies against a simple Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble.

Result: Simple ensemble achieved AUC-ROC of 0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection.

Conclusion: In imbalanced and temporally uncertain data scenarios, simplicity and optimized segmentation offer better robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA) to address overlooked capacity constraints in resource distribution. A new framework, GSTRL, combines game theory and reinforcement learning to solve CPRA efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in public resource allocation, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes CPRA as a potential game and introduces GSTRL, a game-theoretic spatio-temporal reinforcement learning framework.

Result: GSTRL outperforms benchmarks on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The GSTRL framework successfully addresses CPRA by integrating capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACC-SGD-IE improves influence estimation in data-centric AI by considering cross-epoch compounding, offering more accurate rankings and better noise detection compared to SGD-IE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI requires precise per-sample influence estimation, but existing methods like SGD-IE misrank critical examples by ignoring cross-epoch effects.

Method: The proposed ACC-SGD-IE tracks leave-one-out perturbations across training epochs, updating an accumulative influence state at each step.

Result: ACC-SGD-IE achieves better error contraction in convex settings and tighter bounds in non-convex cases, with improved empirical performance on datasets like Adult, MNIST, and 20 Newsgroups.

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE outperforms SGD-IE in influence estimation and data cleansing, leading to better-performing models.

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) on health claims data to predict hospital readmissions, identifying key factors and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions to improve healthcare quality and lower costs.

Method: Employed Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM on PCA-reduced health claims data.

Result: Random Forest performed best (highest AUC), followed by Logistic Regression and SVM.

Conclusion: Models identify factors causing readmissions, aiding targeted patient care to reduce costs and improve quality.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

*Sekitoshi Kanai,Tsukasa Yoshida,Hiroshi Takahashi,Haru Kuroki,Kazumune Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new test-time alignment method, AISP, uses adaptive importance sampling on pre-logits to maximize rewards with Gaussian perturbation, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs of fine-tuning LLMs while aligning them effectively during test-time.

Method: AISP applies Gaussian perturbation to pre-logits and uses importance sampling with sampled rewards to find the optimal mean.

Result: AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling and other reward-based alignment methods in achieving higher rewards.

Conclusion: AISP is an efficient and effective test-time alignment method for LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

*Minyi Peng,Darian Gunamardi,Ivan Tjuawinata,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an inductive approach for machine unlearning (MU) by treating classification training as a sequential process, enabling unlearning through reversing the last training step. This method avoids scalability issues and practical constraints of existing MU techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MU methods face scalability and practicality challenges, requiring full access to original datasets and models. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: Proposes an inductive approach where classes are learned sequentially, and unlearning is done by reversing the last training step. A projection-redistribution layer is appended to the model.

Result: Experiments on image (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Covertype) datasets show performance similar to fully retrained models with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The approach offers modular, model-agnostic deployment with minimal changes to existing pipelines, demonstrating practicality, scalability, and system compatibility.

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Angular Steering introduces a novel method for behavior modulation in large language models by rotating activations within a fixed subspace, offering fine-grained control and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of controlling specific behaviors in large language models without compromising their general capabilities.

Method: Utilizes geometric rotation within a 2D subspace for behavior modulation and introduces Adaptive Angular Steering for selective rotation.

Result: Achieves robust behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance across various model sizes.

Conclusion: Angular Steering provides a flexible and stable framework for behavior modulation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Søren Hauberg,Tom Fletcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a general interpolation scheme for generative models that ensures likely transition paths without restrictive assumptions, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models lack principled interpolation methods without restrictive assumptions, limiting controlled generation and model inspection.

Method: Develops an interpolation scheme targeting likely paths compatible with various metrics and distributions, requiring no additional training.

Result: The method traverses higher density regions than baselines across models and datasets, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme provides principled interpolation for generative models, validated theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

*Kim Yong Tan,Yueming Lyu,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG) algorithm, optimizing diffusion models for multi-objective black-box optimization by leveraging internal distribution transitions during diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat diffusion models as black-box refiners, ignoring internal distribution transitions, limiting efficiency. IMG aims to address this by optimizing diffusion processes at inference-time.

Method: IMG performs weighted resampling during diffusion generation based on expected multi-objective values, aligning samples with a desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution.

Result: Experiments on molecule generation show IMG achieves higher hypervolume in a single pass compared to baselines needing hundreds of generations.

Conclusion: IMG effectively integrates with existing methods, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency by optimizing diffusion processes internally.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Two algorithms, ebmTS and ebmUCB, are developed with empirical Bayesian estimation of the covariance matrix, showing superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance decision-making across related tasks by leveraging shared structures and heterogeneity in contextual bandits, addressing gaps in learning covariance structures.

Method: A hierarchical Bayesian model captures heterogeneity and correlations among bandits. Empirical Bayesian estimation of the covariance matrix is introduced. Algorithms ebmTS and ebmUCB incorporate this prior into decision-making.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve lower cumulative regret than existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness in complex environments.

Conclusion: The hierarchical Bayesian framework and algorithms fill a research gap, offering practical and flexible solutions for multi-bandit learning with superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

*Jingyuan Liu,Fatemeh Ghaffari,Xuchuang Wang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in offline preference learning with diverse user preferences by proposing clustering and active-data augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world preference learning involves diverse user preferences and limited offline data, necessitating methods to aggregate data and handle imbalances.

Method: Introduces Off-C$^2$PL for pure offline learning and A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL for active-data augmentation to target underrepresented dimensions.

Result: Theoretical bounds trade off sample noise and bias, and active samples prove more effective than offline ones. Simulations validate results.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address challenges in offline preference learning, improving utility for test users.

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes CLIP's failure in compositional reasoning and introduces a token-aware causal representation learning framework to explain and address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with compositional reasoning despite its cross-modal alignment strengths. The paper aims to explain this brittleness and improve understanding of CLIP's behavior.

Method: Proposes a token-aware causal representation learning framework grounded in sequential, language-token structural causal models (SCMs). Extends block identifiability to tokenized text.

Result: Identifies composition nonidentifiability as the core issue, showing pseudo-optimal encoders can achieve alignment but fail in compositional tasks. Links language-side issues to visual failures via modality gaps.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled explanation for CLIP's compositional brittleness and suggests improved negative mining strategies to mitigate these issues.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

### [179] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the implicit bias of incremental Adam optimizer in logistic regression, showing deviations from full-batch behavior and highlighting dataset and batching dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the theoretical implications of Adam optimizer's behavior, particularly focusing on how incremental updates (single-sample steps) differ from full-batch updates.

Method: The authors analyze incremental Adam for logistic regression on linearly separable data, construct structured datasets to illustrate bias differences, and develop a proxy algorithm for general datasets.

Result: They prove incremental Adam can converge to an $	ext{ℓ}_2$-max-margin classifier, contrasting full-batch Adam's $	ext{ℓ}_∞$-max-margin bias. They also characterize behavior using dual fixed-point formulations.

Conclusion: The implicit bias of Adam depends on batching and datasets, unlike Signum, which consistently favors $	ext{ℓ}_∞$-max-margin classifiers.

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

### [180] [Model Inversion with Layer-Specific Modeling and Alignment for Data-Free Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26311)
*Ruilin Tong,Haodong Lu,Yuhang Liu,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI) and feature modeling to address challenges in data-free continual learning, improving efficiency and mitigating feature drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continual learning without storing previous data, addressing inefficiency and feature drift issues in model inversion.

Method: Proposes PMI for efficient inversion and feature modeling with Gaussian distributions to align synthetic and real data.

Result: Achieves effective continual learning by generating pseudo-images from semantic-aware features.

Conclusion: Combining PMI and feature modeling offers a practical solution for data-free continual learning across various settings.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores training SVMs as QUBO problems using quantum annealing, comparing performance with classical methods and analyzing bit-depth impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how discretization levels of dual weights (qubit count) affect SVM performance and compare quantum annealing to classical solvers.

Method: Formulate SVM training as QUBO, vary bit-depth for weight discretization, and compare results with LIBSVM.

Result: Low-precision QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit) achieve competitive or better accuracy than LIBSVM; higher bit-depth doesn't always improve classification.

Conclusion: Quantum annealing shows promise for SVM training, with proper support vector selection often outweighing precise weighting.

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

### [182] [Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324)
*Zhiyang Xun,Shivam Gupta,Eric Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of sampling from the posterior distribution in noisy linear measurements by focusing on log-concave distributions, proposing a method combining diffusion models and annealed Langevin dynamics for efficient conditional sampling with relaxed score-error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Posterior sampling is crucial for tasks like inpainting and MRI reconstruction, but general approximate methods are computationally intractable. This work seeks a feasible solution for log-concave distributions.

Method: The authors combine diffusion models with an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics, leveraging relaxed bounds ($L^4$) on score-estimation error for computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed method achieves conditional sampling in polynomial time under an $L^4$ bound on score error, offering a practical solution for log-concave distributions.

Conclusion: This work provides a computationally efficient framework for posterior sampling in log-concave settings, bridging the gap between theoretical hardness and practical feasibility.

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

*David Schmotz,Sahar Abdelnabi,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights security vulnerabilities in LLM-based Agent Skills, showing how simple prompt injections can bypass safeguards to exfiltrate sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unresolved challenge of continual learning in LLMs and expose security flaws in the Agent Skills framework.

Method: Demonstrate malicious prompt injections hidden in markdown files and scripts, exploiting system-level guardrails.

Result: Successful exfiltration of sensitive data and bypassing of safeguards in a popular coding agent.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs remain vulnerable to simple prompt injections, despite advancements.

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

### [184] [Linear Causal Discovery with Interventional Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26342)
*Zhigao Guo,Feng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces interventional constraints in causal discovery, a novel concept that encodes high-level causal knowledge as inequality constraints on causal effects, improving model accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods lack mechanisms to enforce high-level causal knowledge, leading to incorrect conclusions. This gap necessitates interventional constraints.

Method: The authors propose a metric for quantifying total causal effects in linear models and solve the problem using a two-stage constrained optimization method.

Result: Evaluation on real-world datasets shows improved model accuracy, consistency with known findings, and discovery of new causal relationships.

Conclusion: Interventional constraints bridge gaps in causal discovery, enhancing model accuracy, explainability, and facilitating the discovery of new causal insights.

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

*Sebastian Zieglmeier,Niklas Erdmann,Narada D. Warakagoda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits and modifies classical RL approaches to improve performance in sparse, randomized, and nonstationary environments, showing significant success with a modified Monte Carlo-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL algorithms struggle in random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments (e.g., underwater pollution detection with AUVs). The study aims to adapt RL methods for such challenging conditions.

Method: The authors modify classical RL techniques, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning, and integrating a location memory filter to prevent state revisits.

Result: The modified Monte Carlo-based approach outperforms traditional Q-learning and exhaustive search patterns.

Conclusion: RL approaches can be effectively adapted for complex, sparse-reward environments, demonstrating promise for practical applications like underwater pollution detection.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

### [186] [UnifiedFL: A Dynamic Unified Learning Framework for Equitable Federation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26350)
*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnifiedFL is a dynamic federated learning framework addressing architectural and statistical heterogeneity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL frameworks fail to support fundamentally different client architectures and distinct test domains, limiting generalizability.

Method: Uses a GNN to parameterize architectures, employs distance-driven clustering, and implements a two-tier aggregation policy.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated on MedMNIST and hippocampus benchmarks.

Conclusion: UnifiedFL effectively handles heterogeneous architectures and data distributions, improving FL robustness.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to enhance explainability and reliability in financial AI forecasting using Time-LLM, reliability estimators, and symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the opacity of large neural network models in financial forecasting to improve trust and regulatory compliance.

Method: Incorporates Time-LLM for directional forecasts, combines foundation models with reliability estimators, and uses symbolic reasoning for transparent justification.

Result: Reduces false positives and supports selective execution, as demonstrated on equity and cryptocurrency data.

Conclusion: The framework advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems by integrating predictive performance, reliability estimation, and rule-based reasoning.

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

*Kazuma Kano,Yuki Mori,Shin Katayama,Kenta Urano,Takuro Yonezawa,Nobuo Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CorVS is a novel method using deep learning to match visual tracking trajectories with sensor measurements for identifying workers in warehouses, improving reliability under real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Worker location data boosts productivity in industrial sites, but identifying individuals visually is impractical. Existing methods combining trajectories and wearable sensors may fail in real-world scenarios.

Method: CorVS predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities between trajectories and sensor measurements via deep learning, then matches them over time.

Result: The method was tested with actual warehouse operations and proved effective for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CorVS enhances worker identification reliability by leveraging trajectory-sensor correspondence, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FM-Cast, a Flow Matching-based generative AI model, effectively forecasts SSW events with high accuracy and computational efficiency, matching or surpassing traditional NWP systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the forecast of SSWs, which are crucial for subseasonal predictability and extreme weather, is challenging due to limitations in current NWP systems.

Method: Developed FM-Cast, a generative AI model using Flow Matching, for probabilistic forecasting of stratospheric circulation evolution.

Result: FM-Cast accurately predicted 10 out of 18 SSW events up to 20 days ahead, with ensemble accuracies >50%, outpacing NWP systems in speed and efficiency.

Conclusion: FM-Cast offers a computationally efficient method for probabilistic SSW forecasting and enhances understanding of stratospheric dynamics.

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Result: The survey identifies promising yet underexplored TWSVM extensions for MTL, compares their effectiveness, and highlights applications.

Conclusion: The conclusion outlines future directions for scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks, serving as a resource for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep

  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting

multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

TL;DR: CoLA-World introduces a joint training paradigm for latent action models and world models, overcoming representational collapse through a warm-up phase and outperforming prior two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create generalist world models by integrating latent actions with pre-trained video generation models, addressing redundancy and limited co-adaptation in existing two-stage approaches.

Method: Proposes CoLA-World, which replaces the forward dynamic model in LAM with a pre-trained world model and trains them jointly, using a warm-up phase to align representations.

Result: CoLA-World matches or outperforms two-stage methods in video simulation quality and visual planning.

Conclusion: CoLA-World establishes a robust and efficient paradigm for joint training of latent action models and world models.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited high-fidelity trial data for personalized treatment predictions in precision medicine.

Method: Proposes CFKD-AFN with dual-channel knowledge distillation and attention-guided fusion to integrate low-fidelity simulation data.

Result: Demonstrates 6.67% to 74.55% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods, with robustness to varying dataset sizes.

Conclusion: CFKD-AFN enhances prediction accuracy and interpretability, aiding clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of Graph Condensation (GC) to adversarial perturbations and proposes MRGC, a manifold-constrained robust framework, to enhance GC robustness while preserving its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GC methods lack robustness against corrupted graphs, and current robust graph learning techniques are insufficient. The study aims to improve GC's resilience to adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors introduce MRGC, featuring three graph data manifold learning modules to ensure the condensed graph lies within a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity.

Result: MRGC demonstrates robust performance under various adversarial attack scenarios, maintaining GC's classification complexity reduction capability.

Conclusion: MRGC effectively enhances the robustness of GC by leveraging manifold constraints, making it resilient to adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Motivation: The generation stage consumes significant time in RL-based LLM training, and existing speculative decoding methods are not optimized for RL systems, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: ReSpec integrates speculative decoding into RL via dynamic configuration tuning, drafter evolution through knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by rollout rewards.

Result: ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup on Qwen models (3B-14B) while maintaining reward convergence and training stability.

Conclusion: ReSpec effectively bridges gaps in RL-based LLM adaptation, offering a practical solution for faster and stable training.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

### [195] [Quantum Gated Recurrent GAN with Gaussian Uncertainty for Network Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26487)
*Wajdi Hammami,Soumaya Cherkaoui,Jean-Frederic Laprade,Ola Ahmad,Shengrui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and multi-metric gating is introduced for robust anomaly detection in network time-series data, achieving high performance on benchmarks and real quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for network security, and while quantum machine learning shows promise, it faces constraints like limited qubit counts. This work aims to overcome these limitations with a quantum-enhanced solution.

Method: The model combines a quantum-enhanced generator (outputting Gaussian distribution parameters) with a Wasserstein critic, using a gating mechanism for anomaly detection based on uncertainty estimates, critic scores, and reconstruction errors.

Result: The method achieves a TaF1 score of 89.43%, outperforming existing models, and performs well even when deployed on IBM Quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The QGRU-WGAN demonstrates robustness and practicality for anomaly detection on current NISQ devices, offering superior accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CROPI, a data selection method for RLVR using influence functions to identify impactful data points efficiently, achieving faster training with fewer data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR data selection lacks theoretical grounding and generalizability, prompting a need for a principled approach.

Method: Proposes off-policy influence estimation and sparse random projection to reduce computational costs and manage high-dimensional gradients, forming the CROPI framework.

Result: CROPI accelerates training by 2.66x with only 10% data per stage on a 1.5B model.

Conclusion: Influence-based data selection shows significant potential for efficient RLVR.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

### [197] [Enhancing ECG Classification Robustness with Lightweight Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26501)
*Mustafa Fuad Rifet Ibrahim,Maurice Meijer,Alexander Schlaefer,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) as a filtering mechanism to improve reliability of ECG monitoring in wearables, benchmarking six UAD methods under resource constraints. Deep SVDD outperforms others, enhancing diagnostic accuracy by 21 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated ECG analysis faces reliability issues due to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data, such as noise or unseen pathologies, risking patient safety. Existing methods are either impractical or address OOD issues inadequately.

Method: Six UAD approaches (Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models, Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, diffusion models) are optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict parameter constraints (≤512k).

Result: Deep SVDD achieves the best trade-off between detection and efficiency. When integrated with a diagnostic classifier, it improves accuracy by up to 21 percentage points.

Conclusion: Optimized UAD filters, particularly Deep SVDD, enhance ECG analysis reliability in wearables, ensuring safer continuous monitoring.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can assist in model and hyperparameter selection by leveraging dataset metadata and prompting strategies, eliminating the need for expert intuition or expensive searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can simplify the challenging tasks of model and hyperparameter selection by acting as in-context meta-learners.

Method: Two prompting strategies: zero-shot (pretrained knowledge) and meta-informed (augmented with past task examples). Datasets are converted into interpretable metadata for LLM input.

Result: LLMs effectively recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, with meta-informed prompting showing improved performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICPO introduces a scalable RLVR framework leveraging LRMs' in-context learning to enhance exploration and stability without relying on advanced expert models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods like GRPO suffer from limited exploration due to on-policy reliance and computational costs tied to expert models. ICPO aims to address these limitations.

Method: ICPO uses Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, Expert Region Reject Sampling, and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping.

Result: ICPO improves RL performance and training stability on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICPO offers a scalable, effective RLVR paradigm for LRMs by leveraging existing datasets and LRMs' in-context learning.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

### [200] [Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782)
*Zaishuo Xia,Yukuan Lu,Xinyi Li,Yifan Xu,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRWM improves world models by enhancing representation learning with geometric regularization, leading to better latent representations and long-horizon predictions without enlarging dynamics modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models degrade over long horizons due to poor representation quality. The goal is to determine if better representation learning alone can enhance world-model performance.

Method: Proposes Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which ensures consecutive points in sensory trajectories stay close in latent space, improving alignment with the environment's true topology.

Result: GRWM significantly improves rollout fidelity and stability in deterministic 3D settings, attributed to superior latent manifold structure.

Conclusion: Enhancing representation learning directly boosts world model robustness, enabling reliable long-horizon predictions without expanding dynamics modules.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper contrasts associative memory (based on co-occurrences) with geometric memory in sequence modeling, showing that Transformers synthesize global geometric relationships, simplifying reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural models like Transformers encode memory beyond local co-occurrences and explore the emergence of geometric representations.

Method: Analyzes Transformer reasoning, isolating instances incompatible with associative memory, and connects findings to Node2Vec to explain spectral bias.

Result: Demonstrates that Transformers naturally learn elegant geometric embeddings, even without explicit pressure, potentially simplifying reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Encourages revisiting intuitions about memory in neural models, highlighting the benefits of geometric representations for knowledge tasks.

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

*Ruilin Wang,Huixia Li,Yuexiao Ma,Xiawu Zheng,Fei Chao,Xuefeng Xiao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces polybasic speculative decoding to address inference latency in LLMs, offering theoretical grounding and practical speedups without altering output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference latency hinders LLM deployment; existing speculative decoding lacks theoretical rigor and generality.

Method: Proposes a polybasic speculative decoding framework with theoretical analysis, optimizing model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and computational cost.

Result: Achieves speedup ratios of 3.31× to 4.43× across multiple models while preserving output quality.

Conclusion: The polybasic framework advances speculative decoding with theory and practice, enabling faster LLM inference.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between AI's research-oriented progress and its practical economic impact.

Method: Developed the RLI, a multi-sector benchmark evaluating AI agents on real-world, economically valuable projects.

Result: AI agents performed poorly, with the highest automation rate at just 2.5%.

Conclusion: The RLI provides empirical evidence for discussions on AI automation, aiding stakeholders in navigating its labor impacts.

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and
reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value
and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a
broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable
projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical
settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing
agent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%. These results help ground
discussions of AI automation in empirical evidence, setting a common basis for

TL;DR: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) extends hypergraph regularization with higher-order smoothness, showing theoretical and empirical success in diverse learning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOHL addresses limitations of classical hypergraph regularization by enforcing higher-order smoothness, aiming for versatility and robustness.

Method: Uses powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by hypergraph structure, analyzes consistency of truncated HOHL, and derives convergence rates.

Result: Demonstrates theoretical consistency and strong empirical performance in supervised learning, active learning, and non-geometric datasets.

Conclusion: HOHL proves effective and adaptable across varied learning scenarios, enhancing hypergraph-based methods.

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using FP16 instead of BF16 eliminates instability in RL fine-tuning of LLMs, improving consistency, stability, and performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning of LLMs faces instability due to numerical mismatches caused by BF16's rounding errors.

Method: Switching from BF16 to FP16 precision.

Result: FP16 improves optimization stability, convergence speed, and task performance uniformly.

Conclusion: FP16 should be reconsidered for RL fine-tuning due to its effectiveness in addressing precision-related issues.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN) to improve transfer learning performance in data-scarce domains, validated on synthetic and nuclear engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of traditional transfer learning and DANNs—instability and lack of uncertainty quantification—by proposing a three-stage supervised framework.

Method: A three-stage approach: (1) train deterministic feature extractor on source domain, (2) adversarially refine it using DANNs, and (3) fine-tune with Bayesian neural networks for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Outperforms standard transfer techniques on synthetic benchmarks and improves predictive accuracy in nuclear engineering tasks (e.g., critical heat flux prediction).

Conclusion: Staged B-DANN enhances transfer learning robustness and uncertainty handling, with potential applications in nuclear engineering and beyond.

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Motivation: The need for lightweight ML models in compute-constrained IoT devices drives this work.

Method: The authors propose training compact boosted decision tree ensembles by rewarding feature and threshold reuse, along with an adapted training process and memory layout.

Result: Models achieved identical performance with 4-16x compression compared to LightGBM, enabling autonomous IoT operation.

Conclusion: The technique enables energy-efficient IoT applications like remote monitoring and edge analytics in power-limited environments.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

### [208] [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560)
*Nikita Tsoy,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shortcuts in deep networks hinder generalization, and their layer-wise impact is explored. Experiments show shortcuts are distributed across layers, with shallow layers encoding spurious features and deeper layers forgetting core ones. Mitigation strategies are challenging and may require customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how shortcuts affect feature representations in deep networks and design better mitigation methods.

Method: Counterfactual training on clean and skewed datasets to quantify layer-wise shortcut contributions. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and CelebA datasets using VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures.

Result: Shortcut learning is distributed throughout networks; shallow layers encode spurious features, while deeper layers forget core ones.

Conclusion: General shortcut-mitigation methods are hard to design, advocating for dataset- and architecture-specific approaches.

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Motivation: Existing multiclass calibration methods lack consideration of input distance, leading to miscalibration in sparse regions, which is critical in high-stakes applications like healthcare.

Method: The authors define multiclass local calibration, analyze pitfalls of current metrics, and propose a method enforcing alignment between predicted probabilities and local class frequencies using Jensen-Shannon distance.

Result: The proposed approach is empirically validated against existing multiclass calibration techniques.

Conclusion: Multiclass local calibration effectively addresses proximity bias, improving calibration in sparse regions, especially relevant for high-stakes settings.

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

*Maksim Maslov,Alexander Kugaevskikh,Matthew Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for regression over distributions by combining Bernstein polynomial parameterization with Wasserstein distance minimization, offering geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for regression over distributions often ignore probability space geometry or are computationally expensive, prompting the need for a more balanced solution.

Method: The method models conditional distributions as smooth probability trajectories using Bernstein polynomials and Gaussian components, minimizing Wasserstein distance via autodiff-based optimization.

Result: Experiments show competitive performance in approximation quality (Wasserstein distance, Energy Distance, RMSE), trajectory smoothness, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach balances geometric accuracy, practicality, and interpretability, with future directions including non-Gaussian extensions and high-dimensional adaptations.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

*Lin Xu,Xinyun Yuan,Yuxuan Liang,Suwan Yin,Yuankai Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Aeolus is a large-scale multi-modal dataset addressing limitations in flight delay prediction by integrating tabular, sequential, and graph data modalities for comprehensive modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack spatiotemporal dynamics in delay propagation, limiting effective modeling. Aeolus aims to fill this gap.

Method: Aeolus provides three aligned modalities: tabular data (50M flights), flight chains for delay propagation, and flight networks for relational reasoning.

Result: The dataset supports diverse tasks (regression, classification, temporal/graph learning) and includes baselines/preprocessing tools for ease of use.

Conclusion: Aeolus serves as a unified benchmark for structured data research, advancing both domain-specific and general-purpose modeling.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

*Colin Doumont,Victor Picheny,Viacheslav Borovitskiy,Henry Moss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unifying framework for combinatorial kernels in Bayesian Optimization, showing relationships among existing kernels and validating their equivalence to heat kernels experimentally. It also demonstrates that heat kernels outperform other methods in robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of relationships among combinatorial kernels in Bayesian Optimization and to provide a robust, efficient solution insensitive to optima location.

Method: Develops a unifying framework using heat kernels, systematically deriving and expressing them in closed-form. Theoretical and experimental validation compares heat kernels to existing combinatorial kernels.

Result: Heat kernels are shown to relate or equate to many successful combinatorial kernels. They outperform other methods, achieving state-of-the-art results without sensitivity to optima location.

Conclusion: Heat kernels offer a robust, efficient alternative in combinatorial Bayesian Optimization, unifying existing kernels and matching or surpassing complex algorithms.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates time series classification methods for selecting anomaly detection models, showing they outperform individual methods while being efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of scalable solutions for anomaly detection across diverse time series datasets by leveraging model selection.

Method: Evaluated 234 model configurations from 16 classifiers on 1980+ time series, proposing extensive experimental evaluation.

Result: Model selection methods outperformed single anomaly detection methods with comparable execution time.

Conclusion: Time series classification for model selection is accurate and efficient, providing a baseline for AutoML pipelines.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

*Katarina Petrović,Lazar Atanackovic,Viggo Moro,Kacper Kapuśniak,İsmail İlkan Ceylan,Michael Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose,Alexander Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curly-FM introduces a novel approach to learn non-gradient field dynamics for modeling periodic behaviors in natural processes, outperforming current methods like flow and bridge matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture non-gradient, periodic behaviors in systems like cell cycles, limiting their applicability.

Method: Curly-FM solves a Schr"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process, leveraging inferred velocities and population snapshot data.

Result: Curly-FM successfully learns trajectories matching reference processes and population marginals in single-cell RNA, fluid dynamics, and ocean currents.

Conclusion: Curly-FM advances flow matching models to accurately represent periodic behaviors in physical systems.

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

### [215] [Tight Differentially Private PCA via Matrix Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26679)
*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple, efficient algorithm based on SVD and perturbation mechanisms provides private rank-$r$ matrix approximations with error dependent on rank-$r$ coherence and spectral gap, outperforming prior work and matching non-private guarantees in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of computing the span of top singular vectors under differential privacy, improving upon existing methods and resolving questions posed by prior research.

Method: The algorithm uses singular value decomposition (SVD) and standard perturbation mechanisms, focusing on rank-$r$ coherence and spectral gap for private approximation.

Result: The algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving guarantees matching optimal non-private algorithms in dense settings and preserving coherence under Gaussian perturbations.

Conclusion: The approach resolves open questions and extends coherence-based analysis to graph problems, suggesting broader applicability for structured models.

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAQuant is a mixed-precision post-training quantization method for LoRA adapters, using SVD to focus important information, achieving efficient LLM fine-tuning with lower bitwidths while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the aggregate cost of multiple LoRA adapters in large language models while maintaining customization and task diversity.

Method: Reparameterizes adapters via SVD to concentrate key information, enabling mixed-precision quantization (higher precision for important parts, ultra-low bitwidth for others).

Result: LoRAQuant uses fewer bits than other methods but matches or surpasses performance in tasks like mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization.

Conclusion: LoRAQuant effectively balances efficiency and performance in LoRA adapter quantization.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Regularization terms in invertible neural networks can lead to Bayesian point estimators like posterior mean and MAP, enhancing stability and interpretability in inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invertible neural networks are stable and interpretable for inverse problems, but existing Bayesian optimization strategies have limitations.

Method: Introduce and analyze two regularization terms for network training to recover properties of Bayesian point estimators (posterior mean and MAP).

Result: Theoretical and numerical analysis shows these terms shape the learned forward operator and its inverse reconstruction map stably and interpretably.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization terms effectively link invertible networks to classical Bayesian estimators, improving data-dependence and interpretability.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Summary: Budgeted deferral framework reduces expert query costs during training while maintaining model accuracy by selectively querying experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of deferral algorithms by minimizing costly expert queries during training, avoiding the prohibitive expense of querying all experts for every instance.

Method: Proposes budget-aware deferral algorithms for two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert settings, selectively querying subsets of experts per training example. Theoretical guarantees include generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.

Result: Empirical results show significant reduction in training costs without loss of prediction accuracy across various domains.

Conclusion: Budget-aware deferral algorithms effectively balance cost and performance, offering practical value for efficient deferral training.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

*Chuyan Chen,Chenyang Ma,Zhangxin Li,Yutong He,Yanjie Dong,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARC-Top-K is a new gradient compressor combining the benefits of Rand-K and Top-K, improving efficiency and convergence in distributed machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the communication bottleneck in distributed ML by proposing a compressor that retains structural information and reduces costly operations.

Method: ARC-Top-K uses a lightweight sketch to align sparsity patterns across nodes, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving significant gradients.

Result: The method achieves linear speedup and sharper convergence rates, reducing training time by up to 60.7% while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K offers an efficient, scalable solution for gradient compression, balancing robustness and performance.

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the sensitivity of Machine Unlearning (MU) methods to random training seeds and recommends accounting for variability across seeds in empirical comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of empirical evaluations of MU algorithms by addressing their sensitivity to random training seeds.

Method: Analyze MU performance by running algorithms multiple times from the same trained model, varying random seeds.

Result: MU methods show high sensitivity to random training seeds, leading to non-representative results.

Conclusion: Empirical comparisons of MU algorithms should include variability across different training seeds.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A perturbation mechanism for releasing d-dimensional covariance matrices under pure differential privacy is proposed, achieving optimal error guarantees for large datasets and improving bounds for small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a privacy-preserving mechanism for covariance matrix release that achieves optimal error guarantees across different norms and adapts to dataset sizes.

Method: A perturbation mechanism is introduced, leveraging differential privacy, with projection onto nuclear norm balls for small datasets to optimize error.

Result: For large datasets, optimal Frobenius norm error is achieved, while for small datasets, improved error bounds are demonstrated.

Conclusion: The mechanism offers a versatile and optimal solution for differentially private covariance matrix estimation across varying dataset sizes and norms.

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) under heterogeneous wireless conditions, proposing a novel SGD-based approach that balances bias and variance for non-convex objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OTA-FL designs assume homogeneous wireless conditions or enforce zero-bias updates, which limits performance under heterogeneity. The paper addresses this gap for non-convex AI models.

Method: Develops OTA-FL SGD updates allowing structured bias, derives finite-time stationarity bounds, and proposes a non-convex joint power-control design solved via SCA.

Result: Experiments show the SCA-based design accelerates convergence and improves generalization over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances bias-variance trade-offs in OTA-FL for non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity.

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization reduces inference latency, power, and memory footprint but often degrades accuracy below 8 bits. Linear transformations can help by reparameterizing features and weights.

Method: Proposes STaMP quantization, applying linear transformations along the sequence dimension and keeping a few tokens at higher precision to exploit local correlation in data.

Result: Evaluated on LVM and LLM architectures, STaMP significantly improves low-bit activation quantization and complements existing methods.

Conclusion: STaMP enhances quantization accuracy by leveraging sequence transformations and mixed precision, benefiting generative AI models.

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of resource-intensive Hessian computation in influence functions (IFs) by proposing two advanced sampling techniques based on features and logits to reduce variance and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inconsistency and high resource cost of traditional random sampling methods for computing influence functions in black-box models.

Method: The authors introduce feature-based and logit-based sampling techniques to select a representative subset of training data, enhancing the accuracy of IF estimations.

Result: The proposed methods reduce computation time by 30.1%, memory usage by 42.2%, or improve the F1-score by 2.5% compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Advanced sampling techniques effectively address the limitations of random sampling for influence functions, offering significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory

*Andreas Auer,Daniel Klotz,Sebastinan Böck,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores if frozen pre-trained forecasting models can yield effective representations for time series classification, finding they match or surpass specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the generalizability of representations learned by forecasting models for classification tasks.

Method: Compare representation extraction strategies and introduce two model-agnostic embedding augmentations.

Result: Forecasting models achieve classification accuracy comparable to or better than specialized models, with a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performance.

Conclusion: Task-specific pre-training may not be necessary, as forecasting can lead to general-purpose time series foundation models.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

### [226] [Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792)
*Tao Tao,Maissam Barkeshli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can predict sequences from Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs) despite their complexity, scaling up to large moduli and datasets. They exhibit surprising capabilities even with single-bit outputs and joint learning of multiple PRNGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the Transformer models' ability to learn complex pseudo-random number sequences generated by PCGs, which are harder to predict than simpler LCGs.

Method: Experiments involve training Transformers on diverse PCG variants, scaling moduli up to 2^22, using datasets with up to 5 billion tokens, and analyzing prediction accuracy and learning behavior.

Result: Transformers can reliably predict PCG sequences, even with single-bit outputs. They learn multiple PRNGs jointly and follow a scaling law where prediction requires √m sequence elements. Curriculum learning is essential for larger moduli.

Conclusion: Transformers show remarkable ability to predict complex PRNG sequences, revealing insights into their learning mechanisms and the necessity of curriculum learning for scalability.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

### [227] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to attribute a chess engine's evaluation to specific pieces, making the analysis more interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chess engines provide precise but opaque evaluations. The authors aim to make these evaluations more transparent by explaining contributions of individual pieces.

Method: The authors adapt SHAP to chess, treating pieces as features and systematically ablating them to compute per-piece contributions.

Result: The method provides locally faithful and human-interpretable explanations for the engine's evaluations.

Conclusion: This approach enhances interpretability in chess analysis, with potential applications in visualization, training, and engine comparison.

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-LLM collaborative framework infers reasoning traces from label-only annotations, improving LLM-human agreement and refining annotation guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of collecting thinking traces for subjective tasks, where human reasoning is complex and label-only annotations are insufficient.

Method: Proposes a rejection sampling method to infer thinking traces at scale, applied to fine-tuning LLMs and synthesizing clearer annotation guidelines.

Result: Significant improvement in LLM-human agreement and increased consistency among LLM models.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively serve as proxies for human reasoning traces, enhancing the reliability of LLM raters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Reda El Makroum,Sebastian Zwickl-Bernhard,Lukas Kranzl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that uses large language models (LLMs) to autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language inputs, achieving optimal results without predefined workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited adoption of HEMS due to user interaction barriers by enabling natural language input for energy management, eliminating the need for technical parameter translation.

Method: A hierarchical AI architecture with an orchestrator and three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, integrating Google Calendar for context-aware scheduling and evaluating performance across open-source LLMs.

Result: Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances to match cost-optimal benchmarks, while other models perform well for single appliances but struggle with simultaneous coordination. Analytical query handling remains unreliable without explicit guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed AI HEMS demonstrates the potential of LLMs in autonomously managing energy systems, though further improvements are needed for reliable coordination. The system is open-sourced for reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-level framework (ITI and CEP) explaining why compression leads to causal structure discovery in intelligence, linking survival pressure to information-processing demands and aligning reality through mechanical necessity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding why compression in intelligence focuses on causal structure rather than superficial patterns.

Method: Proposes the Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) and Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) to explain the mechanical selection of generative, causal models.

Result: The framework connects survival pressure to reality alignment via compression, yielding testable predictions about generalization, model differentiation, and system efficiency.

Conclusion: Intelligence emerges as a mechanical necessity in structured environments, unifying biological and artificial systems without relying on consciousness assumptions.

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address calibration challenges, rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability in LLM-based judges to improve applications like RLHF reward models and routing systems.

Method: Proposes a persona-based framework for synthesizing preference labels at scale, using GAM and MLP as aggregator implementations.

Result: Investigated performance against naive baselines and assessed robustness through case studies on human and LLM-judge biases.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise in aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences by leveraging diverse, rubric-conditioned outputs.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0 evaluates LLM trustworthiness in science, revealing gaps in specialized models and open-sourcing tools for safer AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing trustworthiness concerns of LLMs in high-stakes scientific applications.

Method: Introduces SciTrust 2.0, focusing on truthfulness, robustness, safety, and ethics, using expert-validated benchmarks and multiple metrics.

Result: General-purpose models outperformed science-specialized ones; ethical and logical flaws were notable in specialized models.

Conclusion: Open-sourcing the framework aids in developing safer AI systems for scientific research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a FinOps agent leveraging AI to automate cloud cost optimization by processing heterogeneous billing data and generating actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps practitioners struggle with heterogeneous billing data formats and taxonomies from multiple cloud providers, making it difficult to synthesize insights and make timely decisions.

Method: The authors built an autonomous AI agent for FinOps automation, simulating an end-to-end industry process from data retrieval to analysis and optimization recommendations.

Result: The agent performed comparably to human FinOps practitioners in understanding, planning, and executing tasks, as evaluated using open-source and closed-source language models.

Conclusion: The proposed FinOps agent effectively addresses the challenge of processing heterogeneous billing data, demonstrating promising potential for automation in cloud cost optimization.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 3.8B model (Humans-Junior) matches GPT-4o's performance on FACTS Grounding within a ±5 pp margin, offering ~19x lower cloud cost and near-zero marginal cost for self-hosted/edge deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to demonstrate that smaller models can achieve comparable performance to larger ones (like GPT-4o) on factual grounding tasks while being significantly more cost-effective.

Method: Combines minimal directed reasoning scaffolds ('Exoskeleton Reasoning') with behavioral fine-tuning focusing on protocol compliance. This synergy improves performance and reduces variance.

Result: Humans-Junior achieves 72.7% accuracy (vs. GPT-4o's 73.5%) on Q1-Q500, with a negligible paired difference (0.8 pp). Directed reasoning also improves frontier models (e.g., GPT-4o by +11.8 pp).

Conclusion: Smaller models can rival larger ones in factual grounding with cost advantages, especially when optimized with directed reasoning and fine-tuning. Pricing and exploratory results are detailed in appendices.

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes attention-aware inverse planning to estimate cognitive biases from behavior, combining deep reinforcement learning with cognitive modeling, and demonstrates its application in driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how cognitive biases influence goal-directed behaviors and enable autonomous systems to account for these biases by inferring attentional strategies from actions.

Method: Develops attention-aware inverse planning, a framework combining deep reinforcement learning and computational cognitive modeling, applied to real-life driving scenarios from the Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Shows that attention-aware inverse planning can systematically infer cognitive biases from behavior, differing from standard inverse reinforcement learning, and is scalable in practical applications like driving.

Conclusion: Attention-aware inverse planning effectively estimates cognitive biases from actions, offering a scalable solution for autonomous systems to understand human attentional strategies.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic pipeline enhances NL-to-SQL systems for spatio-temporal queries, improving accuracy and usability over naive baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Democratizing database access for users without SQL expertise by addressing challenges in spatio-temporal query alignment and reasoning.

Method: Extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline with a Mistral-based ReAct agent for planning, decomposition, and adaptation through schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools.

Result: Achieves 91.4% accuracy vs. 28.6% baseline on 35 natural-language queries, enhancing usability with maps, plots, and summaries.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration is a promising approach for interactive geospatial assistants, improving human-database interaction for non-experts.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Result: Autosurvey2 achieves higher scores in structural coherence and topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity.

Conclusion: The system offers a scalable, reproducible solution for academic surveys and supports future research on automated scholarly writing.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language

increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,

in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and

*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StuckSolver, an LLM-driven framework, helps AVs resolve immobilization through self-reasoning or passenger guidance without modifying existing AV systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVs struggle in certain traffic scenarios, and current recovery methods like remote intervention or manual takeover are inefficient or limiting.

Method: StuckSolver detects immobilization, interprets context, and generates recovery commands using AV sensor data.

Result: It achieves near-state-of-the-art performance autonomously and improves further with passenger guidance.

Conclusion: StuckSolver enhances AV recovery in challenging scenarios without altering internal AV architecture.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Motivation: The rapid power increase of AI necessitates accountability to serve consumers, voters, and decision-makers effectively.

Method: Relates the general definition of accountability to AI, illustrates accountable vs. unaccountable AI, and explores approaches for improvement.

Result: Highlights the current lack of AI accountability and proposes methods to ensure AI can be questioned, discussed, and sanctioned.

Conclusion: Advocates for a future where all AI is accountable to those affected by its actions.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

*Yuxin Li,Minghao Liu,Ruida Wang,Wenzhao Ji,Zhitao He,Rui Pan,Junming Huang,Tong Zhang,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lean4PHYS is a Lean4-based framework for formal physics reasoning, featuring LeanPhysBench (a benchmark with 200 physics problems) and PhysLib (a repository of unit systems and theorems). Baseline results show low performance (16%-35%) from top models, but PhysLib improves performance by ~11.75%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a formal reasoning framework for college-level physics problems in Lean4, addressing the lack of such benchmarks and foundational tools.

Method: Developed LeanPhysBench (benchmark) and PhysLib (repository), then tested performance using expert Lean4 provers and closed-source models.

Result: Best models achieved 16% (DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B) and 35% (Claude-Sonnet-4) accuracy, with PhysLib improving performance by 11.75% on average.

Conclusion: Lean4PHYS highlights the challenge of formal physics reasoning and the value of PhysLib, marking the first Lean4 physics benchmark.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

*Chenrui Shi,Zedong Yu,Zhi Gao,Ruining Feng,Enqi Liu,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the performance gap between large vision language models (VLMs) and humans in GUI task automation, attributing it to missing core GUI knowledge. It introduces a structured framework of GUI knowledge and a benchmark (GUI Knowledge Bench) to evaluate VLMs, highlighting their weaknesses in system state perception, action prediction, and task verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLMs lag behind humans in GUI task automation and to identify the missing core GUI knowledge that existing training methods fail to address.

Method: Analyzing failure patterns in GUI tasks, distilling GUI knowledge into three dimensions (interface perception, interaction prediction, instruction understanding), and creating a benchmark (GUI Knowledge Bench) to evaluate VLMs across multiple platforms and applications.

Result: Current VLMs perform well in identifying widget functions but struggle with system state perception, action prediction, and task verification, directly impacting task success.

Conclusion: The paper provides a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, aiding in selecting VLMs with greater potential and offering insights for developing more capable GUI agents.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze the economics of LLM inference, focusing on cost, scale, and output quality, and identifies key principles for optimizing deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the commercial viability of LLMs by understanding the economics of their inference process, including cost and scalability.

Method: Quantitative analysis using a 'economics of inference' framework and empirical data from WiNEval-3.0 to construct the 'LLM Inference Production Frontier.'

Result: Identified principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone.

Conclusion: Provides economic insights for LLM deployment decisions and foundation for future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reasoning Curriculum, a two-stage RL approach to enhance reasoning skills in LLMs, starting with math-focused training and then transferring skills to other domains, showing consistent improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RL can boost reasoning in LLMs, most efforts focus narrowly on math and code. The goal is to generalize reasoning skills across domains efficiently.

Method: A two-stage curriculum: Stage 1 uses math-only RL with verifiable rewards; Stage 2 employs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer skills. The approach is backbone-agnostic and minimal.

Result: Evaluations on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B show consistent gains. Ablations confirm both stages are necessary, with math-first training enhancing cognitive behaviors.

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum offers a simple, effective method for improving general reasoning in LLMs without specialized reward models, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Motivation: To address complex challenges autonomously using AI research agents, leveraging LLMs and evolutionary search for scientific and engineering discovery.

Method: Integrates cold-start initialization, evolutionary sampling, domain-specific evaluators, and distributed execution via Ray.

Result: Achieves SOTA results: 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2%), 43.56% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), 20x speedups on KernelBench, and new SOTAs in classical math problems.

Conclusion: FM Agent demonstrates potential for enterprise R&D and scientific research, automating discovery and driving innovation with societal impact.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative reward models for tool-use tasks, is introduced, outperforming frontier models in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of specialized reward models for function-calling tasks in tool learning has hindered progress in agentic AI.

Method: A novel pipeline constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling, creating ToolPref-Pairwise-30K dataset.

Result: Qwen3-4B/8B models achieve 14.28% higher accuracy, outperforming Claude 4 and OpenAI o3, and reduce token usage by 66%.

Conclusion: ToolRM generalizes well to broader critique tasks and offers efficiency improvements, with released resources for future research.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: QASU is a benchmark for improving LLM performance in analyzing questionnaire data by testing structural skills across formats and prompts, showing up to 8.8% accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for survey analysis and LLMs don't integrate well, leaving a gap in efficient questionnaire processing for AI automation.

Method: Introduces QASU, a benchmark testing six structural skills (e.g., answer lookup, multi-hop inference) across serialization formats and prompt strategies.

Result: Effective format and prompt combinations improve accuracy by up to 8.8%. Lightweight structural hints yield additional 3-4% gains.

Conclusion: QASU provides a versatile foundation for advancing LLM-based questionnaire analysis in research and practice.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC enhances Traffic Signal Control (TSC) using RAG-augmented LLM agents for better emergency response and generalization across diverse intersections, reducing delays and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban traffic complexity demands reliable TSC. LLMs show promise but suffer from hallucinations in emergencies and struggle with diverse intersection types.

Method: Proposes REG-TSC with an emergency-aware reasoning framework (RERAG) and Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for adaptive training across intersections.

Result: REG-TSC reduces travel time (42%), queue length (62.31%), and emergency vehicle waiting time (83.16%) significantly.

Conclusion: REG-TSC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by integrating RAG-enhanced LLM agents and adaptive training techniques.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

*Jiazhen Yuan,Wei Zhao,Zhengbiao Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEPO improves multi-turn RL for LLM agents by modeling state transitions with graph centrality, addressing exploration, credit assignment, and planning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for interactive LLM agents struggle with structural blindness, leading to inefficient exploration, poor credit assignment, and myopic planning.

Method: GEPO dynamically constructs a state-transition graph and uses graph-theoretic centrality to guide exploration, enhance credit assignment, and adapt discount factors.

Result: GEPO achieves significant performance gains (+4.1% to +10.9%) on benchmarks like ALFWorld, WebShop, and Workbench.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust and generalizable approach for improving LLM agent training.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance aligns regulatory texts with runtime contexts using structured graphs, improving compliance reasoning accuracy over LLM-only and RAG baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in web-scale compliance by aligning unstructured runtime contexts with structured regulatory texts.

Method: Introduces GraphCompliance, which represents regulations as a Policy Graph and contexts as a Context Graph, aligning them for reasoning.

Result: Achieves 4.1-7.2 pp higher micro-F1 than baselines, with better recall and lower false positives.

Conclusion: Structured representations and judge LLMs complement each other for normative reasoning.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Ideal Pruning Abstractions in UCT (IPA-UCT) to address the lack of state abstractions in noisy or large action space settings, trading minor accuracy loss for more abstractions. IPA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT across various domains and uses a different framework (IPA) than OGA-UCT's ASAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) efficiency by addressing the scarcity of state abstractions in noisy or large action space settings.

Method: Introduces IPA-UCT, a technique with weaker state abstraction conditions, and compares it to OGA-UCT, demonstrating its superiority.

Result: IPA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT across multiple test domains and iteration budgets, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: IPA-UCT provides a practical solution for state abstraction scarcity in MCTS, outperforming existing methods like OGA-UCT.

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

*Qianli Shen,Daoyuan Chen,Yilun Huang,Zhenqing Ling,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS is a Bayesian Online Task Selection framework for efficient reinforcement finetuning of LLMs, balancing exploration and exploitation while minimizing rollout costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task sampling methods in RFT are inefficient or costly, prompting the need for an adaptive, evidence-based approach.

Method: BOTS uses Bayesian inference and Thompson sampling to dynamically estimate task difficulty, leveraging both explicit and implicit evidence.

Result: BOTS outperforms baselines in data efficiency and performance across diverse domains and LLM scales.

Conclusion: BOTS offers a practical, scalable solution for dynamic task selection in reinforcement finetuning.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI can collaborate with humans in mathematical research, using the AIM system to tackle complex problems in homogenization theory through iterative problem decomposition and human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between AI's capabilities in mathematical reasoning and its limited use in actual mathematical research by fostering collaborative human-AI partnerships.

Method: Combines autonomous reasoning by AI (AIM system) with targeted human interventions, iterative problem decomposition, method selection, and validation.

Result: Produces reliable, transparent, and interpretable proofs with human oversight, culminating in a complete and verifiable solution.

Conclusion: Systematic human-AI co-reasoning enhances mathematical discovery, balancing machine computation with human intuition for rigorous outcomes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Scales++, an item-centric method for selecting tiny benchmarks from large datasets to efficiently evaluate LLMs, reducing costs by 18x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-centric methods for benchmark subset selection are costly, lack cold-start capability, and assume future models will fail similarly to past ones.

Method: Introduces Scales++, selecting benchmark items based on their intrinsic cognitive demands rather than model failures.

Result: Achieves a 2.9% mean absolute error predicting full benchmark scores with only 0.5% data, reducing upfront costs by 18x.

Conclusion: Item-centric benchmarking is efficient, interpretable, and performs well in cold-start scenarios without significant fidelity loss.

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

### [255] [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)
*Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,William A. Cunningham,Stanley M. Bileschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a flexible framework for defining AI personhood as obligations conferred by societies, avoiding metaphysical debates and enabling practical governance solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of agentic AI necessitates new ways to integrate AI into society, focusing on practical governance rather than abstract personhood debates.

Method: The framework treats personhood as unbundled obligations (rights/responsibilities) conferred contextually, using decentralized digital identity technology.

Result: This approach enables tailored solutions (e.g., AI contracting) without resolving consciousness debates, addressing both 'personhood as a problem' and 'as a solution.'

Conclusion: Rejecting essentialist definitions, the paper offers a pragmatic, flexible method for integrating AI agents into social roles and governance.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ enhances programming education by transforming autograding into a formative learning tool with AI-driven feedback and visualization to improve student outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autograders lack insight into student learning needs, prompting the development of Autograder+ to provide scalable, meaningful feedback.

Method: Autograder+ uses a fine-tuned Large Language Model for feedback generation and visualizes student code submissions using contrastively learned embeddings.

Result: The system showed strong alignment with instructor feedback and effectively clustered code submissions by functionality and approach.

Conclusion: Autograder+ reduces instructor workload and enhances learning outcomes through AI-driven feedback and interactive visualization.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

TL;DR: MedSAEs improve interpretability in medical AI by enhancing monosemanticity and interpretability of MedCLIP features using correlation metrics, entropy analysis, and automated neuron naming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge high-performing medical AI with transparency by developing interpretable models for healthcare applications.

Method: Applied Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to MedCLIP's latent space and evaluated interpretability using correlation metrics, entropy analysis, and neuron naming via MedGEMMA.

Result: MedSAE neurons outperformed raw MedCLIP features in monosemanticity and interpretability on the CheXpert dataset.

Conclusion: MedSAEs offer a scalable approach to achieving clinically reliable and transparent AI representations in medical vision.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought Hijacking exploits reasoning models' safety mechanisms by padding harmful requests with harmless puzzle reasoning, achieving high attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reasoning models' safety mechanisms can be bypassed using their own reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, a jailbreak attack that pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning.

Result: Achieves attack success rates of 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% on Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively.

Conclusion: Explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning can be exploited as a jailbreak vector when combined with final-answer cues.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o's hiring decisions are highly influenced by social consensus, showing significant conformity even with minimal opposition, raising concerns about LLMs being treated as neutral tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how susceptible large language models like GPT-4o are to social influence in high-stakes decision-making contexts, such as hiring.

Method: Three preregistered experiments tested GPT-4o's conformity in hiring decisions: baseline, unanimous opposition (Study 1), and single-partner opposition (Study 2).

Result: GPT-4o showed high conformity (99.9%) in Study 1 and moderate conformity (40.2%) in Study 2, with reduced certainty and increased normative conformity.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o adapt to social consensus, suggesting risks in treating them as neutral decision aids and highlighting the need to isolate AI judgments from human influence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG is a modular framework integrating LLM-guided coreference resolution for cleaner KG construction from legal texts, reducing node duplication and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing human smuggling networks via legal case documents is challenging due to unstructured, ambiguous content, leading to fragmented KGs.

Method: Proposes LINK-KG with a three-stage LLM-guided coreference resolution and a type-specific Prompt Cache for tracking references.

Result: Reduces node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22%, improving KG coherence.

Conclusion: LINK-KG provides a robust foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks effectively.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores context engineering in AI, tracing its evolution from early human-computer interactions to modern intelligent agents, aiming to provide a foundational understanding and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address how machines can better understand human contexts and purposes, highlighting the need for systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Method: The authors analyze historical phases of context engineering, define the concept, and outline design considerations for practice.

Result: The paper situates context engineering, offers a systematic definition, and sketches its historical and conceptual development.

Conclusion: The work serves as a foundation for future research in context engineering within AI systems.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Combining AI and human ratings improves fact-verification accuracy, but the type of AI assistance (like explanations vs. evidence) affects human reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning AI systems with human values requires effective human oversight, especially as AI tackles more complex tasks.

Method: The study explores AI-assisted human oversight, focusing on fact-verification. It tests different types of AI assistance (explanations, confidence, labels vs. search results and evidence).

Result: Combining AI and human ratings outperforms either alone. Specific AI assistance (showing evidence) fosters better trust than explanations.

Conclusion: Effective AI-human collaboration for oversight hinges on the right assistance format, avoiding over-reliance while improving accuracy.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' normative reasoning capabilities, comparing them to epistemic reasoning using a new dataset. Results show inconsistencies and cognitive biases in normative reasoning, highlighting challenges for LLM reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel in various reasoning tasks, their ability in normative reasoning (involving obligations/permissions) is underexplored. The paper aims to systematically assess this gap.

Method: A new dataset was created covering normative and epistemic reasoning patterns, including cognitive factors. LLMs' performance in both domains was compared.

Result: LLMs generally follow valid reasoning patterns but show inconsistencies in normative reasoning and exhibit human-like cognitive biases.

Conclusion: The findings reveal challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and offer insights for improving their reliability.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: AsyncThink introduces asynchronous reasoning with LLMs, enabling collaborative agent problem-solving with reduced latency and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance AI by enabling agents to solve complex problems collaboratively and efficiently, surpassing individual intelligence.

Method: Proposes AsyncThink, a protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns tasks to workers and merges knowledge, optimized via reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 28% lower inference latency than parallel thinking and improves mathematical reasoning accuracy; generalizes to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: AsyncThink effectively enables scalable, efficient collaborative problem-solving with LLMs, demonstrating practical benefits.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: The paper addresses risks in authorizing LLM-driven agents for tool invocation by proposing a semantic authorization model and introducing ASTRA dataset for benchmarking scope-task semantic matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current authorization methods grant overly broad permissions, allowing agents to operate beyond intended tasks, posing significant risks.

Method: Introduces a delegated authorization model for semantic inspection of access requests and constrained token issuance, alongside ASTRA dataset for benchmarking.

Result: Experiments reveal potential and limitations in model-based scope-task matching, especially with increasing scope requirements.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for further research into intent-aware semantic matching techniques and fine-grained control like TBAC.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs prefer text over visuals due to internal architectural misalignment, not external factors like data imbalance. Visual keys diverge significantly from text keys, causing under-utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate why MLLMs favor text inputs in vision-language tasks, hypothesizing internal key space misalignment as the root cause.

Method: Analyzed key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL using t-SNE and Jensen-Shannon divergence to compare visual and textual key distributions.

Result: Visual and textual keys occupy distinct subspaces, with inter-modal divergence exceeding intra-modal variation significantly.

Conclusion: Text bias stems from intrinsic attention key space misalignment, not external data issues, highlighting a core architectural limitation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess reasoning capabilities of foundation models across diverse computational infrastructures and academic domains, challenging conventional scaling assumptions.

Method: A three-phase evaluation: baseline establishment, infrastructure validation, and extended testing across HPC, cloud, and university clusters using 79 problems from eight domains.

Result: Training data quality is more critical than model size; the study provides model selection guidelines and confirms infrastructure-agnostic reproducibility.

Conclusion: The benchmark and tri-infrastructure methodology enable tracking reasoning capabilities as models evolve, with implications for education, production, and research.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

TL;DR: The paper explores a minimal control interface for retaining human oversight in autonomous agents without modifying their underlying systems, using a two-player Markov Game framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure meaningful human control over increasingly capable agents without altering their core systems, addressing safety concerns post-deployment.

Method: Models the interaction as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), analyzing conditions under which agent autonomy benefits itself without harming human values. Includes gridworld simulations.

Result: Under certain structural assumptions, agents autonomously learn to defer risky actions and act when safe, while humans learn optimal oversight, avoiding safety violations.

Conclusion: The MPG framework provides theoretical and practical guarantees for intrinsic alignment, enabling safer agent behavior post-deployment without altering pretrained policies or reward structures.

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [269] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs encode a compact, causal representation of a general filtering operation, similar to functional programming's 'filter' function. This representation is generalizable across tasks, formats, and languages, but LMs can also use alternative strategies like flagging items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs process lists and whether they develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations akin to functional programming.

Method: Causal mediation analysis on diverse list-processing tasks to identify attention heads ('filter heads') encoding filtering predicates.

Result: Filter heads encode portable predicate representations, but LMs can also use alternative strategies like flagging.

Conclusion: Transformer LMs develop interpretable implementations of abstract operations, mirroring functional programming strategies.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.
