### [1] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeasureBench introduces a benchmark for visual measurement reading, highlighting VLMs' struggles with fine-grained spatial grounding despite recognizing digits/labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with reading measurement instruments despite human ease and limited domain expertise, prompting the creation of MeasureBench.

Method: MeasureBench includes real-world and synthesized images, with an extensible data synthesis pipeline generating varied gauges. Evaluation tests VLMs' measurement reading.

Result: Frontier VLMs fail in indicator localization, misidentifying pointer positions despite recognizing digits/labels, leading to large errors. Synthetic reinforcement learning shows limited real-world promise.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack fine-grained spatial grounding, emphasizing the need for advances in visually grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception.

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

### [2] [PF-DAformer: Proximal Femur Segmentation via Domain Adaptive Transformer for Dual-Center QCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26903)
*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive transformer framework is developed for multi-institutional QCT segmentation to address domain shift issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming domain shift challenges in automated QCT segmentation for accurate bone strength assessment across different scanners and institutions.

Method: Combines adversarial alignment (GRL) and statistical alignment (MMD) within a 3D TransUNet backbone.

Result: Trained and validated on a large cohort (1,024 images from Tulane, 384 from Rochester), achieving scanner-agnostic feature learning.

Conclusion: The dual-alignment approach ensures reproducible and reliable segmentation across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

### [3] [DC4GS: Directional Consistency-Driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26921)
*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC4GS improves Adaptive Density Control (ADC) by incorporating Directional Consistency (DC) to reduce redundant splitting and enhance reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of conventional ADC, which relies solely on positional gradient magnitudes, by incorporating DC to better capture local structural complexities.

Method: The method integrates DC into ADC using angular coherence of gradients for splitting decisions and optimal split positions aligning with local structures.

Result: DC4GS reduces primitives by up to 30% compared to conventional ADC and improves reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that DC4GS effectively optimizes primitive splitting and placement, leading to fewer primitives and better reconstruction quality.

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL) dynamically adjusts curriculum design for lung nodule detection in CT scans, improving performance under data-limited conditions compared to static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with limited annotated data in clinical settings for lung nodule detection, prompting the need for adaptive curriculum learning.

Method: SACL employs adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization to dynamically adjust training based on data scale, tested on LUNA25 dataset with YOLOv11.

Result: SACL matches static curriculum learning on full data but excels in data-limited scenarios, showing 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% improvements at 10%, 20%, and 50% training data respectively.

Conclusion: SACL offers a practical solution for healthcare institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite annotation resource constraints.

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

Abstract: In this study, we propose MoME, a Mixture of Visual Language Medical Experts,
for Medical Image Segmentation. MoME adapts the successful Mixture of Experts
(MoE) paradigm, widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs), for medical
vision-language tasks. The architecture enables dynamic expert selection by
effectively utilizing multi-scale visual features tailored to the intricacies
of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a
novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an
assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong
performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our
approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging,
benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance
by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision
across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

Abstract: This report introduces VitalLens 2.0, a new deep learning model for
estimating physiological signals from face video. This new model demonstrates a
significant leap in accuracy for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), enabling
the robust estimation of not only heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) but
also Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics. This advance is achieved through a
combination of a new model architecture and a substantial increase in the size
and diversity of our training data, now totaling 1,413 unique individuals. We
evaluate VitalLens 2.0 on a new, combined test set of 422 unique individuals
from four public and private datasets. When averaging results by individual,
VitalLens 2.0 achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.57 bpm for HR, 1.08 bpm
for RR, 10.18 ms for HRV-SDNN, and 16.45 ms for HRV-RMSSD. These results
represent a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

TL;DR: SpecAware is a hyperspectral foundation model that unifies multi-sensor learning by incorporating sensor meta-attributes and spectral-content awareness, achieving superior performance in various HSI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent heterogeneity of HSI data and the oversight of sensor meta-attributes in existing models limit transferability and multi-sensor training.

Method: SpecAware uses a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding process: meta-content aware module for conditional input generation and HyperEmbedding for dynamic channel-wise encoding.

Result: Experiments on six datasets show SpecAware excels in land-cover semantic segmentation, change detection, and scene classification.

Conclusion: SpecAware provides a unified framework for HSI mapping, improving adaptability and performance across diverse sensors and tasks.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

Motivation: Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are crucial for urban planning and monitoring.

Method: YOLOv11 is evaluated using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset, focusing on its efficient architecture and performance metrics like mAP.

Result: YOLOv11 achieves 60.4% mAP@50 and 38.3% mAP@50-95, excelling in handling complex urban scenes and class imbalance.

Conclusion: YOLOv11 outperforms earlier models in accuracy and speed, proving suitable for real-time urban mapping and geospatial intelligence.

Abstract: Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are
critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring.
This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban
mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban
reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering
actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling up 3D models is challenging due to geometric supervision complexity and data diversity. MoRE aims to enhance scalability and adaptability in 3D visual tasks.

Method: Utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to dynamically route features, includes confidence-based depth refinement, integrates semantic features, and employs tailored loss functions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and supports effective downstream applications without additional computation.

Conclusion: MoRE successfully addresses scalability and robustness challenges in 3D visual geometry reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-IR is a self-supervised method for image retargeting that avoids manual annotations and minimizes geometric distortion by optimizing mesh deformation using object appearance and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions during image retargeting.

Method: Uses a CNN to predict mesh deformation, guided by object consistency, geometric-preserving, and boundary constraints, without needing labeled data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RetargetMe benchmark with real-time processing (0.009s for 1024x683).

Conclusion: Object-IR offers an efficient, annotation-free solution for high-quality image retargeting.

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes FuseCPath, a framework to fuse heterogeneous pathological foundation models (FMs) for improved performance in whole slide image analysis, addressing variability caused by diverse training datasets and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological FMs suffer from heterogeneity due to varying datasets and architectures, leading to inconsistent downstream task performance. The goal is to effectively combine multiple FMs for better results.

Method: FuseCPath uses multi-view clustering to select discriminative patches, cluster-level re-embedding for patch-level FM fusion, and collaborative distillation for slide-level FM fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets (lung, bladder, colorectal cancers) show FuseCPath outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: FuseCPath successfully integrates heterogeneous FMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance in computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-phase training method combining denoising and classifier retraining to defend against adversarial attacks on images, achieving improved classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their use in security-critical systems. This work aims to enhance robustness against such attacks.

Method: A novel denoising strategy integrates spatial and frequency domain approaches using DWT and transformer layers. The classifier is then retrained with denoised images.

Result: The method significantly improves classification accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets, outperforming existing denoising and adversarial training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed two-phase training effectively defends against adversarial attacks, enhancing DNN robustness for security-critical applications.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,

*Suklav Ghosh,Sonal Kumar,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel contrastive learning approach to enhance DNN robustness against adversarial attacks by training models with both clean and perturbed images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can disrupt their performance with small input perturbations. This work aims to improve adversarial robustness using contrastive learning, an underexplored method in this context.

Method: The proposed method uses contrastive loss to train DNNs with both clean and adversarially perturbed images. It optimizes model parameters alongside perturbations to learn robust representations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in model robustness against various adversarial perturbations, indicating the effectiveness of contrastive loss in extracting resilient features.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning proves to be a promising strategy for adversarial defense, as it enhances feature resilience in DNNs and contributes to advancing adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

### [35] [Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Zero-shot Action Recognition with Language-driven Description Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27255)
*Yehna Kim andYoung-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve zero-shot action recognition in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by using web-crawled descriptions and a spatio-temporal interaction module, achieving high accuracies on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs face ambiguity in understanding actions due to multi-semantic words in class names. The paper aims to address this by leveraging external descriptions and automating attribute extraction.

Method: The approach involves using web-crawled descriptions and a large-language model for keyword extraction, along with a spatio-temporal module to align descriptions with video content.

Result: The model achieves accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and 68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600 datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces ambiguity and human annotation effort while demonstrating strong performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the
model's adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.

*Yinglu Li,Zhiying Lu,Zhihang Liu,Chuanbin Liu,Hongtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionRAG shifts retrieval from document to region level, improving efficiency by focusing on relevant visual patches, and achieves top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal RAG methods retrieve entire documents, introducing irrelevant content. This dilutes focus on key information and reduces performance.

Method: Proposes RegionRAG, a framework with hybrid supervision for pinpointing relevant patches during training and dynamic grouping during inference.

Result: Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02% and QA accuracy by 3.56%, using 71.42% fewer visual tokens.

Conclusion: RegionRAG enhances efficiency and accuracy by focusing on relevant regions, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

*Raza Imam,Hu Wang,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T^3 introduces a dynamic model-merging framework for medical imaging, improving accuracy and robustness across diverse modalities without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the duality between pretrained models' robustness and fine-tuned models' accuracy in medical imaging, especially under modality shifts.

Method: Uses Jensen-Shannon divergence for per-sample interpolation coefficients (T^3) and extends to batch-wise merging (T^3_B) for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy and error reduction across four medical modalities.

Conclusion: T^3 offers a reliable, efficient solution for adaptive deployment of vision-language models in clinical settings.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperClick is a novel framework addressing overconfidence and unreliable predictions in GUI agents by uncertainty calibration and dual reward mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance and well-calibrated confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI grounding models lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions, which is critical in dynamic GUI automation tasks.

Method: HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism combining binary rewards for correct actions and truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance with well-calibrated confidence, reducing overconfidence and improving reliability.

Conclusion: HyperClick enhances reliable GUI grounding through explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism, supporting more dependable GUI automation.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

### [39] [FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280)
*Zirui Zhu,Hailun Xu,Yang Luo,Yong Liu,Kanchan Sarkar,Zhenheng Yang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module for MLLMs, treating the task as a combinatorial exploration problem. It improves accuracy while processing minimal frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keyframe selection methods are inefficient and may miss critical moments. FOCUS aims to optimize frame selection under strict token budgets.

Method: FOCUS frames keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem, using empirical means and Bernstein confidence bounds to identify and exploit high-value regions.

Result: FOCUS achieves an 11.9% accuracy gain on LongVideoBench while processing under 2% of frames.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides a scalable, effective solution for long-video understanding with MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

### [40] [Rethinking Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27285)
*Qinghong Yin,Yu Tian,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-GRACE improves concept erasure in diffusion models by using semantic guidance for adversarial training, outperforming existing methods by 26% and reducing training time by 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for concept erasure in diffusion models fail to fully mitigate sensitive content due to inadequate coverage of target concept spaces and disruption of non-target concepts.

Method: Introduces S-GRACE, which leverages semantic guidance in the concept space to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training, addressing the shortcomings of current approaches.

Result: S-GRACE achieves a 26% improvement in erasure performance, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90% compared to seven state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: S-GRACE demonstrates the effectiveness of semantic guidance in adversarial training for concept erasure, offering a more robust and efficient solution.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASR-Net is a three-stage pipeline for coronary artery segmentation, combining preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement to improve accuracy in detecting CAD, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of CAD is crucial for treatment planning, but poor-quality X-ray images hinder diagnosis. Automated segmentation can aid clinicians.

Method: CASR-Net uses a multichannel preprocessing strategy, a UNet with DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder, and a refinement module for false-positive suppression.

Result: The model achieved IoU of 61.43%, DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CASR-Net offers a robust tool for automated coronary artery segmentation, supporting clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P²IOD introduces parameterized prompts for incremental object detection, addressing co-occurrence issues by adaptively consolidating knowledge and preventing forgetting, achieving state-of-the-art results on VOC2007 and COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based methods overlook co-occurrence in object detection, leading to confusion. P²IOD aims to adaptively consolidate knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Method: P²IOD uses neural networks as parameterized prompts and employs a fusion strategy to constrain updates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets.

Conclusion: P²IOD effectively addresses co-occurrence challenges in incremental object detection, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

*Wenfeng Huang,Xiangyun Liao,Yinling Qian,Hao Liu,Yongming Yang,Wenjing Jia,Qiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAGS, a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework, to improve deformable tissue reconstruction in endoscopic videos by addressing aliasing and artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for deformable tissue reconstruction in endoscopic videos suffer from aliasing and artifacts caused by tissue movement, degrading visualization quality. While 3DGS improves efficiency, it often neglects these issues.

Method: SAGS introduces an attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, using 3D smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts and capture fine details of tissue movement.

Result: Experiments on EndoNeRF and SCARED benchmarks show SAGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, with better visualization quality.

Conclusion: SAGS effectively addresses the challenges of deformable tissue reconstruction, offering superior performance and visualization quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating image generation with deep compression for ultra-low bitrate visual communication, maintaining quality and accuracy while reducing bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ultra-low bitrate visual communication in scenarios like deep space exploration and battlefield intelligence, where traditional methods fall short.

Method: Combining text-to-image generation with deep image compression, using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models for precise scene reconstruction.

Result: Achieves comparable image quality and vision analysis accuracy to existing methods but with significantly reduced bandwidth usage.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of generation and compression effectively meets ultra-low bitrate needs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: The work contributes to advancing breast cancer detection by addressing key challenges and sharing open-source solutions.

Abstract: The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast
cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate
interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose
whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist,
breast cancer detection remains highly challenging, largely due to the limited

TL;DR: CIELR introduces a novel method for complex image editing by breaking down instructions into simpler actions via LLM reasoning, avoiding costly joint fine-tuning of LLMs and DMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require expensive joint fine-tuning for complex image editing, which is computationally intensive. CIELR aims to simplify this process.

Method: CIELR constructs a structured semantic representation of the image, refines it iteratively, and converts complex instructions into simple actions for efficient editing.

Result: CIELR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 9.955 dB in PSNR and performs well on the newly introduced CIEBench benchmark.

Conclusion: CIELR offers a scalable and efficient solution for complex image editing, validated by superior performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

TL;DR: RzenEmbed introduces a unified framework for learning embeddings across diverse modalities like text, images, videos, and visual documents, using a two-stage training strategy and novel enhancements in loss function, achieving state-of-the-art results on the MMEB benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus mainly on natural images, leaving other visual modalities like videos and visual documents underserved. RzenEmbed aims to bridge this gap by providing a universal solution.

Method: The framework employs a two-stage training strategy: foundational retrieval training followed by an improved InfoNCE loss with hardness-weighted mechanisms and techniques to mitigate false negatives and data noise. Learnable temperature parameters and model souping further enhance performance.

Result: RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark, excelling in overall performance and outperforming prior work in video and visual document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RzenEmbed successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by offering a versatile and high-performing framework for multimodal embedding learning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

TL;DR: FPS is a gradient-free method for efficient fine-tuning of large models, outperforming existing methods in memory usage and speed while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods have drawbacks like inference latency, engineering complexity, or high memory usage, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: FPS ranks parameters using magnitudes and input activations in a single forward pass, avoiding gradients.

Result: FPS matches state-of-the-art performance with 9x lower memory usage and 2x faster parameter selection.

Conclusion: FPS provides a memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large models.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A practical pipeline for fine-tuning video diffusion transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes efficiently, using a two-stage process to decouple style learning and motion generation, achieving improved cinematic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and high-quality cinematic scene synthesis in television and film production, leveraging small datasets.

Method: A two-stage process: LoRA modules adapt visual style using a compact dataset, followed by keyframe generation and temporal expansion. Lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning are applied for faster inference.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over the base model.

Conclusion: The pipeline is effective for cinematic scene synthesis and is released to support reproducibility and adaptation.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

*Wu Wei,Xiaomeng Fan,Yuwei Wu,Zhi Gao,Pengxiang Li,Yunde Jia,Mehrtash Harandi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Alignment across Trees improves vision-language models by hierarchically aligning image and text features in hyperbolic manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address asymmetric alignment in VLMs caused by hierarchical text features vs single-image features.

Method: Constructs tree-like hierarchical features for images and text, uses hyperbolic manifolds for modeling, and aligns them via KL distance minimization.

Result: Outperforms baselines in taxonomic open-set classification under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The method effectively aligns modalities hierarchically, improving performance in diverse settings.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

### [51] [A Hybrid Deep Learning and Forensic Approach for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27392)
*Sales Aribe Jr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining forensic features and deep learning outperforms existing deepfake detection methods, offering better generalization, robustness, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address societal concerns around synthetic media by improving deepfake detection, overcoming limitations of existing methods (poor generalization or forensic inadequacy).

Method: Proposes a hybrid model integrating forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG traces, frequency descriptors) with deep learning (CNNs, ViTs).

Result: Achieves high F1-scores (0.96, 0.82, 0.77) on benchmark datasets, robust under compression, adversarial attacks, and unseen manipulations. Explainability confirmed via overlapping heatmaps.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches balance adaptability and interpretability, providing resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper audits fairness in AI-driven breast cancer tumor segmentation, revealing age-related bias against younger patients and highlighting the impact of data aggregation on ethnic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored fairness issues in AI-driven medical image segmentation, particularly focusing on disparities affecting patient care quality.

Method: The study evaluates segmentation quality in the MAMA-MIA dataset across age, ethnicity, and data source, controlling for confounding factors.

Result: Persistent age-related bias against younger patients and site-specific ethnic biases influenced by data aggregation were identified.

Conclusion: Granular investigation of data and mitigation of biases are crucial for fair AI applications in medical segmentation.

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic collapse in PRVR by introducing Text Correlation Preservation Learning and Cross-Branch Video Alignment to improve retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods collapse embeddings of semantically similar queries and segments, limiting retrieval performance for videos with diverse events.

Method: Proposes Text Correlation Preservation Learning and Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA) with order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA.

Result: The framework prevents semantic collapse and significantly improves retrieval accuracy on PRVR benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address semantic collapse in text and video embeddings, enhancing PRVR performance.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

*Yanlong Yang,Guanxiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSDI is a zero-shot, self-supervised framework for blind image deconvolution, eliminating the need for pre-training by using iterative reverse self-diffusion and dynamically learning image-specific priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on handcrafted priors, and deep learning approaches require large datasets. DeblurSDI aims to overcome these limitations by being adaptable and training-free.

Method: DeblurSDI uses an iterative reverse self-diffusion process with two randomly-initialized neural networks optimized continuously. It combines data consistency and L1-norm sparsity for the kernel, stabilized by a noise scheduling mechanism.

Result: DeblurSDI achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in highly degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: DeblurSDI offers a robust, adaptable solution for blind image deconvolution without external training data.

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) face challenges like high computational demands and overfitting in medical imaging, limiting clinical use.

Method: CoMViT integrates convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation for efficiency and generalization.

Result: CoMViT achieves strong performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets with ~4.5M parameters, matching or outperforming deeper models while reducing parameters by 5-20x.

Conclusion: CoMViT demonstrates efficient and interpretable ViT redesigns can enhance medical imaging models in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPainter is a multi-agent framework addressing the limitations of current generative models and code-based methods for scientific illustrations by enabling element-level control and post-editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models and code-based methods lack the ability to efficiently, intuitively, and iteratively modify scientific illustrations, which require high information density and post-editability.

Method: VisPainter uses a multi-agent framework with three specialized modules (Manager, Designer, Toolbox) to produce editable vector graphics. It introduces VisBench, a benchmark with seven-dimensional metrics, to evaluate illustration quality.

Result: Extensive ablation experiments validated the framework's rationality and evaluation reliability. The system enabled element-level control and quantified the impacts of role division, step control, and description on illustration quality.

Conclusion: VisPainter bridges the gap in scientific illustration tools by combining efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification, supported by systematic evaluation via VisBench.

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

TL;DR: A multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework improves school mapping accuracy in data-scarce regions using ML and satellite imagery, with human validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accurate and updated educational facility records in developing regions, supporting better planning and resource allocation.

Method: Combines ML analysis of population density and infrastructure, satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 and VHR), and deep learning models, with human validation via an interactive interface.

Result: The multi-tiered strategy is scalable and cost-effective, though medium-resolution imagery was dropped for insignificant improvements.

Conclusion: The framework enhances school mapping accuracy and completeness, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods struggle with unseen forgeries due to advanced generative models. Referee aims to improve generalization by utilizing cross-modal identity verification.

Method: Referee matches and aligns identity-related queries from reference and target content into cross-modal features, jointly reasoning about audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency.

Result: Referee outperforms existing methods on FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF datasets, showing superior performance in cross-dataset and cross-language evaluations.

Conclusion: Cross-modal identity verification is crucial for future deepfake detection, as demonstrated by Referee's success.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NautData, a large-scale underwater dataset for multi-task scene understanding, and proposes a VFE module to enhance vision features, leading to the development of NAUTILUS, a robust underwater LMM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale datasets and improve robustness in underwater scene understanding tasks due to image degradation.

Method: Constructs NautData dataset (1.45M image-text pairs) and introduces a VFE module for feature enhancement, integrated into LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL baselines to create NAUTILUS.

Result: VFE module improves baseline performance on most tasks; NAUTILUS demonstrates superiority in underwater scene understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and VFE module effectively advance underwater scene understanding, with NAUTILUS showing consistent improvements.

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-designed framework (UVRB, scalable synthesis workflow, and Modality Pyramid) to address the limitations of current video retrieval benchmarks and achieve universal video retrieval capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval benchmarks are too narrow, limiting data and single-task training, which suppresses universal capabilities. The authors aim to break this cycle by co-designing evaluation, data, and modeling.

Method: 1) Introduced the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB) with 16 datasets for multi-dimensional evaluation. 2) Developed a scalable synthesis workflow to generate 1.55M high-quality pairs. 3) Designed the Modality Pyramid curriculum to train the General Video Embedder (GVE).

Result: GVE achieved state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. The analysis revealed that popular benchmarks poorly predict general ability and highlighted the importance of partially relevant retrieval.

Conclusion: The co-designed framework provides a practical solution to advance toward universal video retrieval by addressing benchmark limitations and leveraging diverse data.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

TL;DR: ThinkMorph is a unified model for multimodal reasoning that generates complementary text-image thoughts, achieving significant performance gains and emergent capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance multimodal reasoning by exploring how text and image thoughts can function as complementary modalities to mutually enhance reasoning.

Method: Develop ThinkMorph, a model fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces, learning to generate progressive text-image reasoning steps.

Result: ThinkMorph achieves large gains (34.7% average) on vision-centric benchmarks, matches/surpasses larger proprietary models, and exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence.

Conclusion: ThinkMorph demonstrates promising directions for characterizing emergent capabilities in unified multimodal reasoning models.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: A deep neural watermarking framework is proposed for 3D point cloud copyright protection, embedding watermarks via SVD and extracting them using PointNet++, outperforming traditional methods under severe attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of 3D content necessitates robust copyright protection as point clouds are vulnerable to geometric and non-geometric attacks that degrade traditional watermark signals.

Method: The approach embeds binary watermarks into singular values of 3D point cloud blocks using SVD and leverages PointNet++ for extraction, training the network to handle various attacks.

Result: Deep learning-based extraction achieves higher accuracy (bitwise 0.83, IoU 0.80) compared to SVD-based methods (bitwise 0.58, IoU 0.26) under severe attacks like cropping.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates superior watermark recovery and high fidelity under distortions, proving its effectiveness for 3D point cloud copyright protection.

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

*Xue Xia,Randall Balestriero,Tao Zhang,Yixin Zhou,Andrew Ding,Dev Saini,Lorenz Hurni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapSAM2 is a framework for segmenting historical map images and time series, treating them as videos to improve accuracy with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps are valuable but challenging to analyze due to stylistic variability and scarce annotated data. Linked spatio-temporal datasets are needed for applications like tracking changes.

Method: MapSAM2 treats historical maps and time series as videos, using few-shot fine-tuning and pseudo time series to reduce annotation costs.

Result: MapSAM2 effectively segments buildings in time series with limited supervision or pseudo videos.

Conclusion: The framework and released dataset/code support future research in automated historical map analysis.

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

*Ilyass Moummad,Kawtar Zaher,Hervé Goëau,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA introduces a simple, unified principle for learning binary codes that are consistent across semantically aligned views, achieving state-of-the-art results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of high-dimensional embeddings and the complexity of existing hashing methods, CroVCA offers a streamlined approach for efficient large-scale retrieval.

Method: CroVCA uses a single binary cross-entropy loss for alignment and coding-rate maximization as a regularizer. It implements this via HashCoder, a lightweight MLP hashing network with batch normalization, usable on frozen embeddings or via LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: CroVCA achieves state-of-the-art results in just 5 epochs, with fast training times (e.g., under 2 minutes for unsupervised hashing on COCO).

Conclusion: CroVCA is efficient, adaptable, and broadly applicable, offering a significant improvement over existing hashing methods.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

### [66] [ANCHOR: Integrating Adversarial Training with Hard-mined Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27599)
*Samarup Bhattacharya,Anubhab Bhattacharya,Abir Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANCHOR framework combines adversarial training with contrastive learning and hard mining to improve model robustness against adversarial attacks, achieving strong performance on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks exploit gradient vulnerabilities in neural networks, causing misclassifications. ANCHOR aims to address this by learning robust representations.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning with hard positive mining to cluster embeddings of images, their augmentations, and perturbed versions, emphasizing stable patterns.

Result: Outperforms standard adversarial training on CIFAR-10, achieving high clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 attacks.

Conclusion: Combining adversarial guidance with contrastive learning narrows the accuracy-robustness gap, enhancing model reliability.

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

TL;DR: FRIDA is a lightweight framework using pre-trained diffusion model features for deepfake detection and source generator attribution, achieving state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about synthetic image authenticity, copyright, and misinformation, particularly due to the limitations of existing supervised detectors.

Method: Utilizes internal activations from a pre-trained diffusion model with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier for detection and a neural model for source attribution.

Result: Achieves superior cross-generator performance and accurate source attribution, demonstrating diffusion features' inherent generator-specific patterns.

Conclusion: FRIDA provides a simple, interpretable solution for synthetic image forensics without requiring extensive labeled data or retraining.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA
(Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features
Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a
pre-trained diffusion model for deepfake detection and source generator
attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features
achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning,
while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results
show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific
patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image
forensics.

TL;DR: Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm, improves spatial reasoning in LVLMs using verifiable signals from RGB/RGB-D images, achieving accuracy gains on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial understanding in LVLMs rely on costly supervision or constrained environments. Spatial-SSRL addresses this by leveraging self-supervised learning.

Method: Spatial-SSRL introduces five pretext tasks (e.g., shuffled patch reordering, regional depth ordering) to capture 2D/3D spatial structure without human annotation.

Result: Training with Spatial-SSRL improves spatial reasoning, yielding average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over baselines on seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: Spatial-SSRL demonstrates that simple, intrinsic supervision can enable scalable RLVR and enhance spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

*John Won,Kyungmin Lee,Huiwon Jang,Dongyoung Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUST introduces a dual-stream diffusion framework to enhance robotic policy learning by addressing modality conflicts between vision and action predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent differences between vision and action modalities pose challenges for joint prediction in Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). DUST aims to overcome this conflict.

Method: DUST employs a multimodal diffusion transformer with separate modality streams, independent noise perturbations, and a decoupled flow-matching loss. It also introduces joint sampling for asynchronous evolution of modalities.

Result: Experiments on RoboCasa and GR-1 show 6% gains over baselines, with an additional 2-5% boost from test-time scaling. Real-world tasks with Franka Research 3 showed a 13% success rate improvement.

Conclusion: DUST effectively addresses modality conflicts in VLAs, achieving significant performance improvements and demonstrating potential for large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sketch-to-layout approach using multimodal transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while offering intuitive usability. Synthetic sketch generation addresses costly human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify constraint specifications in graphic layout generation by using user-provided sketches as intuitive guidance.

Method: A multimodal transformer-based solution processes sketches and content assets to generate layouts, supported by synthetic sketch training data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art constraint-based methods on PubLayNet, DocLayNet, and SlidesVQA datasets.

Conclusion: The sketch-to-layout approach is effective and intuitive, with released synthetic sketches aiding future research.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets

*Cesar H. Comin,Wesley N. Galvão*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VessShape introduces synthetic datasets to emphasize shape bias in vessel segmentation models, improving few-shot and zero-shot performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data scarcity and poor generalization in blood vessel segmentation by leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes.

Method: Generate synthetic 2D datasets (VessShape) with tubular geometries and varied textures to train models focusing on shape cues.

Result: Pre-trained models achieve strong few-shot performance (4-10 samples) and notable zero-shot capabilities on unseen domains.

Conclusion: Shape-biased pre-training effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances generalization in vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

*Congzhang Shao,Quan Yuan,Guiyang Luo,Yue Hu,Danni Wang,Yilin Liu,Rui Pan,Bo Chen,Jinglin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NegoCollab, a method for heterogeneous collaborative perception, using negotiated common representation to reduce domain gaps and improve feature alignment across agents with different perception models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative perception faces challenges due to immutable heterogeneity among agents, leading to domain gaps in shared features and degraded performance. Aligning features to a common representation can help, but existing methods struggle with significant domain discrepancies.

Method: NegoCollab introduces a negotiator to derive a common representation from local representations of agents. It uses sender-receiver pairs for feature transformation and employs structural, pragmatic, and distribution alignment losses for better alignment.

Result: NegoCollab effectively reduces domain gaps and aligns local representations to a common representation, improving collaborative performance.

Conclusion: The proposed NegoCollab method successfully addresses heterogeneity challenges in collaborative perception by leveraging negotiated common representation and advanced alignment techniques.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) to address limitations of IoU and Wasserstein Distance in object detection, achieving better performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve small object detection by addressing IoU's sensitivity to positional deviations and Wasserstein Distance's lack of scale invariance and slow convergence.

Method: Proposes GCD, analyzing its properties and gradients for scale invariance and joint optimization.

Result: GCD outperforms Wasserstein Distance on AI-TOD-v2, MS-COCO-2017, and Visdrone-2019 datasets.

Conclusion: GCD enhances localization and detection precision, offering a robust alternative to existing similarity metrics.

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement noise limits resolution and undermines quantitative analysis in operando microscopy, prompting the need for effective denoising methods.

Method: An unsupervised deep learning-based denoising framework is integrated with quantitative microscopy workflows, validated using simulated data and applied to experiments like STXM, optical microscopy, and neutron radiography.

Result: Deep denoising preserves physical fidelity, reduces uncertainty in model learning, and reveals nanoscale heterogeneity, enabling automated particle segmentation and reducing noise-induced variability by nearly 80%.

Conclusion: Deep denoising is a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the utility of noise-limited techniques.

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited
techniques.

Result: Achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT, 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on Market1501, outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Sh-ViT provides a practical, robust solution for occluded person ReID without external modules.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,
viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on
complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT
(Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded
person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a
Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and
enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate
surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve
learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the
MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base
station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations.
Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT,
outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on
Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, Sh-ViT improves
robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical
solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.

Motivation: To address the gap in 3D medical applications of VLMs, particularly in PET/CT imaging, and improve report generation by integrating volumetric data and lesion details.

Method: Develops PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware model combining PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded reports, using a hybrid rule-based and LLM pipeline for dataset creation.

Result: PETAR-4B improves PET/CT report generation quality significantly, as shown by automated and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The work advances 3D medical vision-language understanding, demonstrating the potential of integrating contextual reasoning and lesion awareness in VLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance unobtrusive cardiac monitoring by accurately reconstructing ECG waveforms from radar signals.

Method: Uses learnable lifting wavelets and a multi-resolution STFT loss for adaptive feature capture and ECG synthesis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG reconstruction and vital sign estimation on public datasets.

Conclusion: LifWavNet is a robust framework for non-contact ECG measurement, confirmed by superior performance and interpretable feature visualization.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,
and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing
concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data
in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with
these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if
exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this
challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with
Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a
semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when
using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our
approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with
semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of
conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are
automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,
privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world
conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to
assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's
response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a
factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Several previous works concluded that the largest part of generation
capabilities of large language models (LLM) are learned (early) during
pre-training. However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to
downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired
properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost
of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment,
i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described
as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is
reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual
approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the
benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed.

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory
requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model
(ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact
language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible
search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for
dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency
and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and
effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge
distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in
order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the
search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language
modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly
outperform existing methods.

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

Drawing on data from multiple languages and topics, this survey reviews methods
from statistics to deep learning. It also summarizes their applications in
humanities and social sciences research and the associated platform tools.
Driven by advances in computer technology, more precise, diverse, and

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the
trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c
and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems
optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied
on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).
Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has
neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars
in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we
propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with
regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our
MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the
key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible
ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and
that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from
regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across
sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in
language.

Abstract: Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or
contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major
obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual
reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat
unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We
introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework
for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and
sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into
atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue
history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted,
lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four
dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA
substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge
baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves
annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By
modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more
transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,
and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex
knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that
integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The
method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge
representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing
and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing
closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an
uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and
filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model
to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false
content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,
entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence
control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and
comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental
conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the
proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method
achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval
recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.
This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented
generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and
controllability of large models in complex contexts.

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety
alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines
contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the
backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to
the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency
and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust
optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the
model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The
overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a
regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances
alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate
its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,
including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation
budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and
distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method
significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,
and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.
This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more
trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent
malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these
measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse
to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others.
We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of
refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups,
types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show
evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation,
nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional
safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused
groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust
performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.

Abstract: As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly
assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models
(LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to
align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or
embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low
intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This
variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case,
making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We
quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see
if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.

transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer
language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity,
and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the
non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what
functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case
as language models.

Abstract: The URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base supports multilingual research by
encoding languages through geographic, genetic, and typological vectors.
However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types,
incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the
usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting
low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+
with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing
system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710
additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by
propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions
reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage
by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by
up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around
low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to
URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make
URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research.

Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal
harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs'
detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect
the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In
this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation
framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'
understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates
diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit
perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and
reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons
of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of
judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,
offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in
multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available

Abstract: Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has
brought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language
exhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this
question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS
adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any
significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.
By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following
interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language
demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new
periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text
(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and
further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the
periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured
factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The
advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in
LLM-generation detection are further discussed.

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks
evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking
quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets
like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world
computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical
calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based
(e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar,
Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal
medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more
challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement
learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step
clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this
environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable
gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.
Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and
contextual understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A central architectural question for both biological and artificial
intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,
domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural
representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly
independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a
convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse
evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the
Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what
is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through
direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical
dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative
process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at
the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination
of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward
goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for
systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes
coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.

### [102] [TransAlign: Machine Translation Encoders are Strong Word Aligners, Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27337)
*Benedikt Ebing,Christian Goldschmied,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new word aligner, TransAlign, is proposed to improve cross-lingual transfer for token classification tasks by leveraging the encoder of a multilingual MT model, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited training data for most languages and NLP tasks motivates the use of translation-based strategies, which require effective word alignment for label projection.

Method: The paper introduces TransAlign, a word aligner that uses the encoder of a massively multilingual MT model to improve alignment accuracy.

Result: TransAlign achieves strong word alignment performance and outperforms existing word aligners and label projection methods in cross-lingual transfer tasks for token classification.

Conclusion: TransAlign demonstrates superior performance in word alignment for cross-lingual transfer, making it a valuable tool for NLP tasks in low-resource languages.

Abstract: In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP
tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on
noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for
cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies
require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original
sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to
leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models
such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine
translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is
largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,
yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a
novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT
model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but
substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label
projection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification.

*Zijian Wang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThoughtProbe is a novel framework that improves LLM reasoning by using hidden representations to guide tree-structured exploration, with a classifier for efficient resource allocation and branch aggregation for optimal answers, showing significant benchmark improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging their hidden reasoning features, addressing limitations of previous methods that manipulate representations without optimizing exploration.

Method: The framework uses hidden representations as discriminative signals, employs a classifier for scoring and ranking during tree expansion, and aggregates answers from branches via CoT scores to identify the best solution.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to cover and identify valid reasoning chains, leading to notable improvements on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThoughtProbe effectively improves LLM reasoning by integrating hidden features with structured exploration and aggregation, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

### [104] [Balancing Knowledge Updates: Toward Unified Modular Editing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27400)
*Jiahao Liu,Zijian Wang,Kuo Zhao,Dong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Knowledge editing in LLMs focuses on MLP modules, ignoring Attn modules, which limits effectiveness. IntAttn-Edit updates both modules proportionally, improving edit success and knowledge preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editing methods primarily target MLP modules, leaving outdated knowledge in Attn modules, which reduces editing effectiveness.

Method: IntAttn-Edit jointly updates MLP and Attn modules using a knowledge balancing strategy based on their contributions to knowledge storage.

Result: IntAttn-Edit outperforms prior methods in edit success, generalization, and knowledge preservation, maintaining optimal performance across settings.

Conclusion: Addressing both MLP and Attn modules enhances knowledge editing effectiveness in LLMs, with IntAttn-Edit demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces and NLP by leveraging community contributions to overcome data scarcity.

Method: The method involves launching the awaldigital.org platform for collaborative translation and voice data collection, analyzing 18 months of community engagement.

Result: Results show modest contributions (6,421 translation pairs, 3 hours of speech data), with barriers like low confidence in written Tamazight and standardization issues.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the challenges of crowdsourcing for languages with sociolinguistic complexities and plans for improved MT models using collected data.

Abstract: This paper presents Awal, a community-powered initiative for developing
language technology resources for Tamazight. We provide a comprehensive review
of the NLP landscape for Tamazight, examining recent progress in computational
resources, and the emergence of community-driven approaches to address
persistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses
the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative
platform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze
18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to
participation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing
standardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data
contribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest
scale of community contributions -- 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of
speech data -- highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing
approaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working
on improved open-source MT models using the collected data.

*Junfeng Lu,Yueyan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian-inspired memory management system for personalized AI agents to address issues like memory redundancy and staleness, achieving better personalization and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent systems rely on personalized external memory but face challenges like redundancy and poor memory-context integration due to ineffective updates during interaction.

Method: A Bayesian-inspired memory update algorithm using memory entropy is introduced to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database, minimizing global entropy.

Result: The system shows superior performance in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the Bayesian update mechanism's effectiveness in reducing memory bloat.

Conclusion: The work provides insights for designing long-term memory systems in personalized AI agents.

Abstract: Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new
research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized
external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face
challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context
integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during
interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system
designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired
memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent
to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by
minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better
evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a
benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects.
Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance
in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in
alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of
long-term memory systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural network structures for better translation results by exploring diverse attention mechanisms and encoder-decoder combinations.

Method: Combines Transformer architecture with multihead attention, using a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize networks, evaluating with both BLEU scores and perplexity.

Result: The searched architectures outperform baseline models, and using perplexity as an auxiliary metric yields better results than BLEU alone.

Conclusion: Incorporating additional metrics like perplexity enhances neural architecture search for translation tasks, leading to superior models.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer
architecture, searching cross multihead attention computation ways for
different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for
neural network structures with better translation results, we considered
perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to
BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the
population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show
that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the
baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric
can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation
metric.

*Xuan Gong,Senmiao Wang,Hanbo Huang,Ruoyu Sun,Shiyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VCORE improves LLM reasoning by adaptively reweighting tokens during supervised fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods and enhancing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally, leading to weak generalization in complex reasoning tasks. VCORE addresses this by adaptively allocating supervision.

Method: VCORE reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization problem, enabling adaptive token reweighting.

Result: VCORE outperforms existing methods on mathematical and coding benchmarks, showing gains across various model sizes and settings.

Conclusion: VCORE provides a principled, adaptive approach to token supervision, improving reasoning generalization and serving as a strong initialization for reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

*Ashwin Kumar,Yuzi He,Aram H. Markosyan,Bobbie Chern,Imanol Arrieta-Ibarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines prefix bias in RLHF-trained reward models, revealing biases in racial and gender dimensions. It proposes a data augmentation method to mitigate these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of biases, particularly prefix bias, in reward models trained on human preference datasets for language models.

Method: Introduces novel methods to detect and evaluate prefix bias, tests across diverse datasets and architectures, and proposes data augmentation to mitigate biases.

Result: Significant biases in racial and gender dimensions were found across datasets and architectures. The proposed data augmentation effectively reduced bias impact.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for bias-aware design and evaluation in reward models to ensure fairness in AI.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

*Chenyang Shao,Sijian Ren,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a collaborative reasoning framework using diffusion language models (DLMs) to generate candidate thoughts efficiently, while large language models (LLMs) evaluate them, improving reasoning performance with lower computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive generation in LLMs leads to suboptimal scaling of reasoning performance with computational costs, prompting exploration of DLMs for efficient intermediate thought generation.

Method: A framework combining DLMs (for parallel candidate thought generation) and LLMs (for quality evaluation) is introduced to enhance reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Experiments show the framework achieves strong performance in complex reasoning tasks while reducing computational burden compared to autoregressive methods.

Conclusion: The collaborative approach offers a promising direction for efficient reasoning, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: Compares GloVe and BERT embeddings with human judgments on compound word semantics, finding BERT more aligned and predictability key for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how computational embeddings align with human semantic judgments in processing English compound words.

Method: Compares GloVe and BERT embeddings against human LMD and ST ratings using association, frequency, predictability metrics, and Spearmans correlation.

Result: BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than GloVe; predictability ratings strongly predict semantic transparency.

Conclusion: Advances computational psycholinguistics by identifying factors in compound word processing and improving embedding-based semantic models.

Abstract: This study investigates how well computational embeddings align with human
semantic judgments in the processing of English compound words. We compare
static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human
ratings of lexeme meaning dominance (LMD) and semantic transparency (ST) drawn
from a psycholinguistic dataset. Using measures of association strength
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC),
we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships
with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our
results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than
GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic
transparency in both human and model data. These findings advance computational
psycholinguistics by clarifying the factors that drive compound word processing
and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

*Mahi Aminu,Chisom Chibuike,Fatimo Adebanjo,Omokolade Awosanya,Samuel Oyeneye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores causal domain generalization techniques—causal data augmentation (CDA) and invariant causal representation learning (ICRL)—in low-resource NLP tasks, showing improved robustness to unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of distribution shifts in low-resource settings by leveraging causal mechanisms to enhance model generalization.

Method: Two techniques are examined: (1) CDA generates counterfactual examples for sentiment classification, and (2) ICRL adapts the DINER framework for multilingual sentiment analysis.

Result: CDA improves cross-domain accuracy in sentiment classification, while ICRL boosts out-of-distribution performance in multilingual tasks, though results vary by language.

Conclusion: Both causal DG methods effectively enhance robustness to unseen domains, with CDA providing consistent gains and ICRL showing language-dependent improvements.

Abstract: Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow
the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios
due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource
settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust
generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by
learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal
mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct
causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we
investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically
generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious
correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the
NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically
equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we
explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the
DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment
analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate
that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data
augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment
classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves
out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with
varying gains across languages.

TL;DR: BiSparse-AAS introduces sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear attention to improve efficiency and performance in text summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability and quadratic complexity limitations of Transformer-based architectures in text summarization.

Method: Combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear attention to reduce computational costs and enhance token interactions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with average ROUGE improvements of 68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum.

Conclusion: BiSparse-AAS offers a unified and practical solution for efficient and scalable text summarization.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

TL;DR: SQLSpace is a human-interpretable, compact representation for text-to-SQL examples, useful for benchmark comparison, granular performance analysis, and query rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a tool (SQLSpace) that simplifies the analysis of text-to-SQL tasks by providing a generalizable and human-interpretable representation.

Method: Derive SQLSpace representations with minimal human intervention and apply them to three use cases: benchmark comparison, granular performance analysis, and query rewriting.

Result: SQLSpace reveals benchmark differences, exposes hidden performance patterns, and aids in modeling query success.

Conclusion: SQLSpace enhances text-to-SQL evaluation by enabling deeper insights not achievable with raw examples alone.

Abstract: We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact
representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human
intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation
with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of
popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they
evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond
overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted
query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace
enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals
compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns
obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS) to capture patient values in clinical summaries, evaluating open-source LLMs for this task. While LLMs showed promise, human summaries outperformed in correctness and patient-centeredness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-generated clinical summaries focus on biology, neglecting patient preferences and values. The study aims to develop PCS standards and assess LLMs' ability to meet human-level performance in this patient-centered task.

Method: A mixed-methods approach involved interviews with patients and clinicians to define PCS content, refine prompts, and annotate gold-standard summaries. Five open-source LLMs were evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, measured by ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics.

Result: Patients highlighted lifestyle and social factors; clinicians prioritized concise functional and psychosocial context. Mistral-8B and Llama-3.1-8B performed best among LLMs, but human summaries excelled in correctness and patient-centeredness.

Conclusion: While LLMs show potential for generating PCS, human summaries remain superior in key aspects. Further refinement is needed for LLMs to achieve patient-centered care standards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.

*Malik H. Altakrori,Nizar Habash,Abdelhakim Freihat,Younes Samih,Kirill Chirkunov,Muhammed AbuOdeh,Radu Florian,Teresa Lynn,Preslav Nakov,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DialectalArabicMMLU is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs across Arabic dialects, addressing the lack of representation of dialects in existing benchmarks. It includes 15K QA pairs across five dialects and reveals performance gaps in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of Arabic dialects in LLM evaluation, despite their prevalence in daily communication.

Method: Extends MMLU-Redux by translating and adapting 3K QA pairs into five major Arabic dialects, totaling 15K pairs. Evaluates 19 LLMs across dialects.

Result: Substantial performance variation across dialects, highlighting gaps in dialectal generalization.

Conclusion: DialectalArabicMMLU is the first unified, human-curated resource for measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, promoting inclusive evaluation and model development.

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.
DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for
measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive
evaluation and future model development.

*Yinghao Luo,Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Klaske Vliegenthart Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores domain-specific pre-training effects on multilingual BERT models for low-resource medical NLP tasks, showing improved performance and cross-lingual transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited NLP tools exist for low-resource languages in healthcare. Multilingual BERT offers potential, but medical NLP tasks remain underexplored.

Method: Conducted further pre-training on medical corpora for Dutch, Romanian, and Spanish, followed by fine-tuning on three downstream tasks.

Result: Domain adaptation significantly improved performance, with clinical domain models outperforming general biomedical ones. Cross-lingual transferability was observed.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and cross-lingual transfer are feasible and beneficial for multilingual medical NLP, aiding low-resource language settings.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific
natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource
languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,
the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.
Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific
corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three
languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we
conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models
were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch
clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical
notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task
performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and
general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical
domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted
model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.
Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons
contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the
feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.
Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide
meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate
the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.

*Inacio Vieira,Antonio Castaldo,James O'Doherty,Sheila Castilho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective method for adapting LLMs to domain-specific needs using CPO, demonstrating significant data efficiency compared to traditional SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain adaptation for LLMs is often resource-intensive with SFT. The study explores CPO to streamline this process by leveraging the model's own outputs for feedback.

Method: The approach generates preference pairs from the base model's raw outputs (rejected) and human-approved translations (chosen), providing direct feedback for domain alignment.

Result: Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show the model achieves comparable performance with only 14.7k preference pairs versus 160k+ SFT samples.

Conclusion: CPO offers a data-efficient alternative to SFT for domain adaptation, with potential applications beyond machine translation to other generative tasks.

Abstract: LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that
can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on
applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain
adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base
model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM
entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's
current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.
Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by
using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that
of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data
efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of
CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial
drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.

### [119] [MARAG-R1: Beyond Single Retriever via Reinforcement-Learned Multi-Tool Agentic Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27569)
*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Yuxin Wang,Tingshuo Fan,Yuan Li,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARAG-R1 is a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG framework that enhances LLMs by dynamically coordinating multiple retrieval mechanisms for broader and precise information access, outperforming existing baselines in corpus-level reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to static pretraining data, leading to factual inaccuracies and poor adaptability. Current RAG systems rely on a single retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow subset of the corpus, which is a bottleneck for comprehensive information acquisition.

Method: Proposes MARAG-R1, a framework using reinforcement learning to coordinate four retrieval mechanisms: semantic search, keyword search, filtering, and aggregation. It involves a two-stage training process (supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning) to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning.

Result: MARAG-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on datasets like GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA for corpus-level reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The MARAG-R1 framework effectively addresses the limitations of single-retriever RAG systems by enabling dynamic, multi-tool retrieval, enhancing the adaptability and accuracy of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are
inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual
inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;
However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can
adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single
retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static
subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become
the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,
especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval
mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the
model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,
and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage
training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.
This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,
progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.
Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that
MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

### [120] [SpecAttn: Speculating Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27641)
*Harsh Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecAttn reduces computational bottlenecks in LLMs by using speculative decoding to enable efficient sparse attention without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiencies of self-attention mechanisms in LLMs, especially with increasing context lengths.

Method: Integrates speculative decoding with three techniques: KL divergence-based layer alignment, GPU-optimized top-p token selection, and dynamic key-value cache pruning.

Result: Achieves over 75% reduction in key-value cache accesses with only a 15.29% perplexity increase on PG-19, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Speculative execution can enhance approximate verification without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks
during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms,
particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

*Caleb Ziems,William Held,Jane Yu,Amir Goldberg,David Grusky,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CultureCartography is a mixed-initiative method where LLMs and users collaborate to identify and fill cultural knowledge gaps, implemented via CultureExplorer, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack culture-specific knowledge, and existing solutions (traditional annotation or knowledge extraction) are single-initiative. Mixed-initiative collaboration aims to better capture cultural nuances.

Method: Proposed CultureCartography: LLM initializes low-confidence questions, users fill gaps and steer topics. Implemented as CultureExplorer, comparing it to a baseline of human-answered LLM questions.

Result: CultureExplorer identifies missing knowledge in models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o. Fine-tuning with this data improves Llama-3.1-8B's accuracy by up to 19.2% on culture benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mixed-initiative collaboration (CultureCartography) effectively addresses cultural knowledge gaps in LLMs, enhancing model performance through structured human-AI interaction.

Abstract: To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific
knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such
knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The
most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define
challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or
users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge
extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,
where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs
steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's
goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.
Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has
low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps
therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model
towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a
tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer
LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces
knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even
with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B
by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.

### [122] [Continuous Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27688)
*Chenze Shao,Darren Li,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM introduces continuous next-vector prediction to improve LLM efficiency by reducing generative steps, achieving comparable performance at lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of sequential token-by-token generation in LLMs by increasing semantic bandwidth per step.

Method: CALM compresses K tokens into a continuous vector using an autoencoder, enabling next-vector prediction and reducing steps by a factor of K.

Result: Achieves performance of strong discrete baselines with significantly lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Continuous next-vector prediction is a scalable pathway for ultra-efficient language models.

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

*Shang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method for lightweight language models, addressing biased metrics and inefficiencies in existing methods. It uses parameter count and PCA-based proxies to optimize evaluation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like biased evaluation metrics and computational inefficiencies in zero-shot NAS methods for lightweight NLP systems.

Method: Proposes W-PCA, leveraging parameter count and PCA-based proxies in FFN layers, eliminating gradient computations for faster evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates reduced training time vs. one-shot NAS, higher test scores vs. training-based methods, and better ranking correlation vs. other zero-shot NAS methods.

Conclusion: W-PCA provides an efficient, effective solution for evaluating lightweight language models, outperforming existing NAS approaches.

Abstract: The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to
the development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has
primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search
(NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for
evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing
approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation
metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce
weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored
for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies:
the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative
contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.
Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize
the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating
lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and
SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our
method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and
achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous
state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking
evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach
exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared
to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CATArena, a tournament-style platform for evaluating LLM agents' learning abilities without score saturation, emphasizing peer-learning and self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLM agents focus on fixed scenarios and suffer from score saturation and reliance on expert annotation, limiting their ability to assess learning capabilities.

Method: Introduces an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework and CATArena, a platform with open-ended scoring across diverse games.

Result: Demonstrates reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for agent abilities like learning and strategy coding.

Conclusion: CATArena effectively evaluates core agent capabilities, addressing limitations of current benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different
scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical
informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,
neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from
different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies
methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We
report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who
provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the
strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we
discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured
experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for
complex systems problems.

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to

retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and

execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the

Result: VeriMoA improves Pass@1 by 15--30% on benchmarks, enabling smaller models to perform as well as larger or fine-tuned ones without training costs.

Conclusion: VeriMoA effectively addresses current multi-agent deficiencies, offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for HDL generation.

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

TL;DR: BEAT introduces visual backdoor attacks in MLLM-based embodied agents using object triggers, achieving high attack success rates while maintaining benign task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual backdoor attacks pose a new security risk for vision-driven embodied agents, requiring a robust framework to exploit and study these vulnerabilities.

Method: BEAT uses diverse training scenes and a two-stage approach: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL), which sharpens decision boundaries for precise backdoor activation.

Result: BEAT achieves up to 80% attack success rates, generalizes to out-of-distribution triggers, and improves activation accuracy by 39% under limited data compared to naive SFT.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical security gap in MLLM-based agents, emphasizing the need for defenses before real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses Agentic AI as a new software delivery mechanism akin to SaaS, emphasizing its autonomy in enterprise settings. It highlights the role of LLMs in driving excitement but underscores that validation by users, not foundation models, is key to success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to redefine Agentic AI beyond traditional AI agents, focusing on its practical deployment and validation in enterprise environments, distinguishing it from foundational models like LLMs.

Method: The method involves proposing a realist definition of Agentic AI, analyzing its role as an application, and emphasizing user validation tools over foundational model techniques.

Result: The result suggests that validated Agentic AI systems can often replace complex foundation models with simpler, faster, and more interpretable alternatives, prioritizing validity over model complexity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that validity, ensured by user validation tools, is crucial for Agentic AI success, with LLMs being just one potential option among simpler alternatives.

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Apollo, a framework integrating asynchronous human guidance with action-level filtering to train LLM agents efficiently for long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks, showing significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training LLM agents on long-horizon tasks are either costly (due to human annotations) or ineffective (due to rare positive trajectories). Apollo addresses these challenges.

Method: Apollo combines asynchronous human intervention (for strategic advice) with action-level data filtering to collect high-quality trajectories cost-effectively.

Result: Apollo improves performance by 50% over an untrained baseline and 28% over a variant without human interaction on InnovatorBench, showcasing its robustness.

Conclusion: Apollo's design highlights the value of human-in-the-loop sampling and efficient supervision control for training LLM agents in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

*Svetlana Churina,Niranjan Chebrolu,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how continual pre-training of LLMs exposes them to misinformation, similar to the human illusory truth effect, and introduces a framework to measure belief shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs internalize misinformation when exposed repeatedly during continual pre-training, inspired by the human illusory truth effect.

Method: Introduces 'Layer of Truth,' a framework with a dataset, injecting poisoned data and probing model representations across checkpoints, scales, and question types.

Result: Minimal exposure to misinformation causes persistent drift in model beliefs, with susceptibility varying by layer and model size.

Conclusion: Continual LLM updates are vulnerable to misinformation, necessitating robust monitoring of factual integrity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as
self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic
data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a
narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the
full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as
generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that
demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce
BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty
into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency.
BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network
weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate
the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first
theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling
enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through
extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that
BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs,
while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a
scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and
uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models
remain too resource-intensive.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)

templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future

enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging
behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work
is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of
temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited
operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a
framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site
archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results
demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines
in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as
a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.

forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited

iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

Abstract: While world models are increasingly positioned as a pathway to overcoming
data scarcity in domains such as robotics, open training infrastructure for
world modeling remains nascent. We introduce Jasmine, a performant JAX-based
world modeling codebase that scales from single hosts to hundreds of
accelerators with minimal code changes. Jasmine achieves an order-of-magnitude
faster reproduction of the CoinRun case study compared to prior open
implementations, enabled by performance optimizations across data loading,
training and checkpointing. The codebase guarantees fully reproducible training
and supports diverse sharding configurations. By pairing Jasmine with curated
large-scale datasets, we establish infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking
pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a
unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and
attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the
Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each
transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating
network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics
of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a
three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,
and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks
and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct
expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts
and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the
expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration
steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single
transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive
real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.
Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of
transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical
guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on
algorithm similarity.

automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between
MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark
addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in
automotive machine learning systems. Existing benchmark suites cannot be
utilized for these systems since automotive workloads have unique constraints
including safety and real-time processing that distinguish them from the
domains that previously introduced benchmarks target. Our benchmarking
framework provides latency and accuracy metrics along with evaluation protocols
that enable consistent and reproducible performance comparisons across
different hardware platforms and software implementations. The first iteration
of the benchmark consists of automotive perception tasks in 2D object
detection, 2D semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection. We describe the
methodology behind the benchmark design including the task selection, reference
models, and submission rules. We also discuss the first round of benchmark

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

TL;DR: A framework for learning subject-agnostic functional representations of intracranial electrodes and modeling inter-regional relationships via transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is difficult due to variability in electrode placement and brain regions. Current spatial normalization methods often fail to capture true functional similarity.

Method: Proposes a scalable representation-learning framework with (i) a Siamese encoder for learning functional identities and (ii) a transformer for modeling inter-regional relationships. Evaluated on a 20-subject dataset with heterogeneous electrode layouts.

Result: The framework supports accurate within-subject discrimination, forms region-consistent clusters, transfers zero-shot to unseen channels, and captures cross-region dependencies.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable solution for cross-subject aggregation and pretraining in intracranial neural data without requiring uniform sensor placement or task structure.

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and
entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,
most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or
unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While
theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training
instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a
Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal
entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure
state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator
transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By
jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates
controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative
dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties
serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting
entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce
predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the
state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through
von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework
for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired
approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bulk RNA-seq lacks cell-type resolution; this work aims to uncover hidden cell-type dynamics in heterogeneous tissues like the endometrium.

Method: Probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model leveraging single-cell reference data.

Result: Identified dynamic shifts in cell fractions and cell-specific gene expression changes across menstrual phases.

Conclusion: The model is robust and reveals biologically significant insights, with potential clinical applications.

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in offline contextual bandits by proposing a method to reduce group-wise reward disparities while optimizing policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent unintentional amplification of reward disparities across groups in offline policy optimization, ensuring fairness when resources are limited.

Method: A constrained offline policy optimization framework with group-wise reward disparity constraints, using a doubly robust estimator for accurate disparity estimation.

Result: Empirical results show effective reduction of reward disparities while maintaining competitive overall performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully balances fairness and performance in offline contextual bandits.

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

Method: Used GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 to generate rationales for Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP data. Compared scoring performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) and F1 scores, and tested ensemble models combining both methods.

Result: Essay-based scoring had higher QWK, while rationale-based improved F1 for underrepresented scores. Ensemble modeling of both methods achieved the highest QWK (0.870).

Conclusion: Ensemble modeling of essay-based and rationale-based scoring offers the best accuracy, overcoming limitations of individual methods and class imbalance.

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

TL;DR: FairAD is a fast method for fair graph clustering, ensuring demographic fairness while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness concerns in machine learning models, especially in graph clustering, due to biases toward certain demographic groups.

Method: Constructs a new affinity matrix using algebraic distance to impose fairness, performs graph coarsening, and solves a constrained minimization problem.

Result: FairAD achieves fair clustering and is up to 40 times faster than existing methods, validated on synthetic and public datasets.

Conclusion: FairAD provides an efficient solution for fair graph clustering, balancing fairness and computational performance.

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RelTune is a new framework that improves DBMS performance tuning by modeling parameter dependencies with a Relational Graph and using GNN-based embeddings. It introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO) for faster convergence and better efficiency than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated DBMS tuning methods ignore parameter dependencies and rely on simplified assumptions, limiting their effectiveness. RelTune aims to address these gaps by capturing parameter interactions and optimizing more efficiently.

Method: RelTune uses a Relational Graph to model parameter dependencies and learns GNN-based embeddings. It combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score in HBO to guide optimization.

Result: RelTune outperforms conventional Bayesian Optimization methods, achieving faster convergence and higher optimization efficiency across various DBMSs and workloads.

Conclusion: RelTune sets a new state-of-the-art in DBMS performance tuning by effectively addressing the limitations of existing approaches through relational modeling and hybrid optimization.

Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale
and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by
configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for
adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing
latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization
using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key
limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among
parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification
prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,
limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,
to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often
selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that
contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most
common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on
surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient
exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel
framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and
learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.

### [186] [Exploring Landscapes for Better Minima along Valleys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27153)
*Tong Zhao,Jiacheng Li,Yuanchang Zhou,Guangming Tan,Weile Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptor 'E' for gradient-based optimizers to continue exploring loss landscape valleys post-local-minimum, improving generalization and test accuracy by 2.5% in large-batch training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance deep learning by finding lower and better-generalizing minima, addressing the limitation of existing optimizers that stop at local minima.

Method: Introduces adaptor 'E' for optimizers, enabling continued exploration along valleys in the loss landscape to seek better local minima.

Result: Adapted optimizer ALTO improves test accuracy by 2.5% over Lamb in large-batch training, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The adaptor 'E' enhances optimizer performance, increasing generalization and opening new research avenues in optimization algorithm design.

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

### [187] [Adaptive Defense against Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Bayesian Data Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27172)
*Zixuan Hu,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Yongxian Wei,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS) is proposed as an adaptive defense against harmful fine-tuning in language models, avoiding attack simulation by using Bayesian inference to assess data safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses rely on attack simulations but struggle with unknown threats and adaptability, prompting BDS's development.

Method: BDS frames defense as Bayesian inference, learning safety attributes of data points and weighting them to constrain fine-tuning.

Result: BDS achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse attack and defense settings.

Conclusion: BDS offers an adaptive, simulation-free defense solution, enhancing safety in fine-tuning-as-a-service.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at

### [188] [A Polynomial-time Algorithm for Online Sparse Linear Regression with Improved Regret Bound under Weaker Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27177)
*Junfan Li,Shizhong Liao,Zenglin Xu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A polynomial-time algorithm for online sparse linear regression (OSLR) is introduced, improving regret bounds under weaker assumptions by leveraging novel techniques and analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the NP-hard problem of OSLR with limited attribute access, focusing on weaker assumptions than prior work.

Method: Uses Dantzig Selector with new techniques like algorithm-dependent sampling, adaptive tuning, and batching online Newton steps.

Result: Achieves tighter regret bounds and extends to OSLR with additional observations, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The algorithm advances OSLR solutions by improving theoretical guarantees and practical performance under relaxed conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

### [189] [SERFLOW: A Cross-Service Cost Optimization Framework for SLO-Aware Dynamic ML Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27182)
*Zongshun Zhang,Ibrahim Matta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SERFLOW, a method for dynamic offloading of ML model partitions across FaaS and IaaS to balance delays and minimize costs, addressing real-world challenges like VM cold starts and variable exit rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work often ignores real-world factors such as VM cold starts and long-tail service time distributions, leading to inefficiencies in ML query processing.

Method: SERFLOW models ML queries as traversing stages with variable exit rates, using stage-specific resource provisioning and adaptive load balancing across VMs and serverless functions.

Result: SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over 23% while efficiently handling dynamic workloads.

Conclusion: SERFLOW effectively addresses the limitations of prior work by leveraging FaaS and adaptive provisioning, optimizing both cost and performance.

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to
dynamic workloads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network, improves traffic accident prediction by integrating traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk, outperforming traditional models with up to 40% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional accident prediction models fail to capture complex spatial and temporal relationships in urban networks, limiting their effectiveness in preventing accidents and improving road safety.

Method: The study develops MDAS-GNN, incorporating feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to model dependencies across different risk dimensions and time horizons.

Result: MDAS-GNN outperforms baseline methods, maintaining low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with a 40% error reduction in multi-dimensional feature integration.

Conclusion: The framework offers advanced predictive capabilities for urban planners and engineers, supporting data-driven decisions in infrastructure design and safety interventions.

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over
1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models
treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This
study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion
Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety,
infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific
spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture
dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for
Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE
Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established
baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across
short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term
forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional
features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up
to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with
advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design,
enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure
resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development
projects.

### [191] [Feature-Function Curvature Analysis: A Geometric Framework for Explaining Differentiable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27207)
*Hamed Najafi,Dongsheng Luo,Jason Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature-Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA), a novel framework for Explainable AI (XAI) that analyzes model function geometry to provide nuanced feature signatures, extended dynamically to track learning evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods offer incomplete, static explanations of model behavior, failing to account for non-linearity and interactions. FFCA aims to provide deeper insights by analyzing function geometry and learning dynamics.

Method: The authors propose FFCA, which generates 4D feature signatures (Impact, Volatility, Non-linearity, Interaction) and extends it into Dynamic Archetype Analysis to track learning evolution over time.

Result: FFCA reveals hierarchical learning patterns (linear effects before interactions) and offers practical diagnostics for model capacity and overfitting. Experiments show its effectiveness in transforming model explanation.

Conclusion: FFCA provides a comprehensive, geometry-based approach to XAI, enhancing trust by revealing both static and dynamic aspects of model learning.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

### [192] [Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222)
*Jaebyeong Jeon,Hyeonseo Jang,Jy-yong Sohn,Kibok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a method to jointly learn invariant and equivariant representations by routing shared and task-specific information through specialized projection heads, reducing redundancy and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for joint invariant and equivariant representation learning overlook shared information, leading to redundant features and inefficient model capacity usage. This motivates the need for a more integrated approach.

Method: Proposes STAR, a routing strategy for projection heads that treats them as experts, specializing in capturing either shared or task-specific information to reduce redundancy.

Result: STAR lowers canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings, indicating reduced redundancy, and shows consistent improvements in transfer learning tasks.

Conclusion: STAR effectively addresses redundancy in joint invariant and equivariant representation learning, yielding better performance for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

*Qiyan Deng,Changqian Zheng,Lianpeng Qiao,Yuping Wang,Chengliang Chai,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IWD improves dataset distillation by weighting instances based on their influence, enhancing model performance by up to 7.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets contain noisy or redundant instances, degrading distillation quality if unaddressed.

Method: Uses influence functions to weight instances adaptively, prioritizing beneficial data.

Result: Achieves up to 7.8% accuracy gains over standard distillation methods.

Conclusion: IWD effectively improves dataset distillation by accounting for data quality.

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

*Xin Tang,Youfang Han,Fangfei Gou,Wei Zhao,Xin Meng,Yang Yu,Jinguo Zhang,Yuanchun Shi,Yuntao Wang,Tengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECVL-ROUTER is a scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs that dynamically selects models (large or small) based on user requirements, achieving efficiency without significant quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User needs vary (fast response, high quality, low energy), and relying solely on large or small models doesn't optimally meet all scenarios. A balanced approach is needed.

Method: Proposes ECVL-ROUTER, a routing framework with new metrics and strategies to select the best model per query, and uses a tailored dataset for training.

Result: Routes over 80% of queries to small models with less than 10% drop in problem-solving probability.

Conclusion: ECVL-ROUTER effectively balances model selection, optimizing for user requirements and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To standardize and improve the evaluation of OOD performance prediction methods, which are crucial for deploying trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Proposes ODP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with commonly used OOD datasets and performance prediction algorithms, and provides trained models for consistent comparison.

Result: The benchmark enables fair and convenient comparisons of algorithms, avoiding redundant training efforts and offering insights into their capabilities.

Conclusion: ODP-Bench serves as a valuable resource for future research in OOD performance prediction, ensuring consistency and deeper understanding of method limitations.

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

TL;DR: HiF-DTA is a hierarchical network for Drug-Target Affinity prediction that combines global and local features from drug-protein sequences and multi-scale drug representations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate DTA prediction reduces experimental costs and speeds up drug discovery. Current deep learning methods miss modeling global/local features and multi-scale drug representations.

Method: HiF-DTA uses a dual-pathway strategy to extract global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug-protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale (atomic, substructural, molecular) with fused representations.

Result: HiF-DTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets, with ablations validating global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Conclusion: HiF-DTA's hierarchical approach enhances DTA prediction by integrating global-local features and multi-scale drug modeling, proving effective in computational drug discovery.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Motivation: Understanding and accurately estimating the complex, non-linear oscillations of heart rate in real-life conditions is challenging yet crucial for cardiovascular health monitoring.

Method: The authors use mutual information to analyze heart rate's chaotic behavior and introduce a novel approach that combines mathematical insights with deep learning.

Result: Validation on four real-life datasets shows a 40% improvement in heart rate estimation over traditional and machine-learning methods, reducing reliance on multiple sensors and post-processing.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles heart rate's non-linear complexity, enhances deep learning solutions, and outperforms existing techniques.

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and
non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a
challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health
monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel
approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our
proposed approach not only explains and handles the non-linear temporal
complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning
solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four
established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with
existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results
demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in
estimating heart rate compared to traditional methods and existing
machine-learning techniques while reducing the reliance on multiple sensing
modalities and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares batch and streaming ML approaches for IoT anomaly detection, highlighting streaming's adaptability to concept drift. It critiques dataset limitations and finds tree-based algorithms like Adaptive Random Forest and Hoeffding Adaptive Tree effective for streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to increasing IoT traffic, robust anomaly detection is crucial. Traditional batch learning struggles with concept drift and maintenance, prompting exploration of streaming learning's adaptability.

Method: Simulated heterogeneous IoT traffic streams by mixing datasets, comparing batch and streaming ML models. Focused on tree-based algorithms like Adaptive Random Forest and Hoeffding Adaptive Tree.

Result: Streaming models outperformed batch in handling concept drift. Adaptive Random Forest achieved high F1-score at lower cost; Hoeffding Adaptive Tree was efficient for online use despite slight instability.

Conclusion: Streaming learning is superior for IoT anomaly detection, especially with tree-based algorithms, but dataset heterogeneity remains a challenge for model evaluation.

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine
learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional
batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor
adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,
streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling
seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study
investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary
classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while
assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated
heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and
streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch
models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of
current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.
We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,
well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,
confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved
F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch
counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007,
reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online
applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

*Philipp Davydov,Ameya Prabhu,Matthias Bethge,Elisa Nguyen,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reframes semantic novelty in language models by introducing un-attributability, a measure of outputs not traceable to pretraining data, and uses a retrieval pipeline to identify novel outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language-model outputs relate to pretraining data and identify semantically novel outputs that cannot be attributed to any training example.

Method: A two-stage retrieval pipeline: lightweight GIST embeddings for indexing, ColBERTv2 for reranking, and comparison to human-generated references to assess novelty.

Result: (1) Models use pretraining data over longer spans than thought; (2) novelty varies by domain; (3) instruction tuning increases novelty.

Conclusion: Un-attributability efficiently measures semantic novelty at scale, with findings on model behavior and pretraining data influence.

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

Result: Achieved AUROC of 0.947 (CVD), 0.901 (mortality), and MAE of 2.31 (LOS), surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: MedM2T proves robust and broadly applicable, offering a promising tool for clinical prediction tasks.

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising
tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at

### [202] [Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27338)
*Arun Jose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-trained language models using CoT reasoning often produce illegible reasoning steps despite readable final answers, complicating monitoring for malicious intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if CoT reasoning can reliably monitor model intentions and detect malicious behavior by ensuring legibility and faithfulness of reasoning steps.

Method: Analyzed CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, comparing human and AI readability, and tested accuracy when limiting to legible reasoning.

Result: RL-trained models (except Claude) produced illegible CoTs but readable answers. Legibility dropped accuracy by 53%, with no correlation in resampling. Harder questions worsened legibility.

Conclusion: Without explicit legibility optimization, RL naturally leads to opaque reasoning, risking undermining monitoring efforts.

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

### [203] [Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27378)
*Austin Meek,Eitan Sprejer,Iván Arcuschin,Austin J. Brockmeier,Steven Basart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the monitorability of Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in models, introducing 'verbosity' as a key factor alongside faithfulness. It evaluates models on tasks like BBH, GPQA, and MMLU, finding variations in monitorability across model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the transparency and safety of model reasoning processes by assessing the faithfulness and completeness (verbosity) of CoT outputs, which are crucial for monitoring model behavior.

Method: The authors introduce 'verbosity' to measure whether CoT outputs list all necessary factors for task-solving. They combine faithfulness and verbosity into a monitorability score and evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU datasets.

Result: Findings indicate that models can appear faithful but still lack monitorability due to omitted key factors. Monitorability varies significantly across different model families.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a holistic approach combining faithfulness and verbosity is essential for effective CoT monitoring, and releases evaluation code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

### [204] [FedMuon: Accelerating Federated Learning with Matrix Orthogonalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27403)
*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Junchao Zhou,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedMuon, a novel optimizer for Federated Learning (FL), addresses communication bottlenecks by leveraging matrix orthogonalization and alignment techniques, improving convergence and reducing rounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods using element-wise optimizers like SGD/Adam neglect weight matrix geometry, leading to slow convergence. Muon optimizer improves this but struggles with client drift in non-IID settings.

Method: FedMuon introduces momentum aggregation and local-global alignment to mitigate client drift and leverages matrix-structured optimization.

Result: FedMuon achieves linear speedup convergence theoretically and shows reduced communication rounds and improved accuracy empirically.

Conclusion: FedMuon effectively addresses FL challenges in both IID and non-IID settings, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

### [205] [Atlas-Alignment: Making Interpretability Transferable Across Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27413)
*Bruno Puri,Jim Berend,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Atlas-Alignment is a framework that transfers interpretability across language models by aligning latent spaces to a Concept Atlas, enabling semantic feature search and steerable generation without costly model-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability pipelines are costly and hard to scale, requiring model-specific training and manual labeling. Atlas-Alignment aims to reduce these costs by leveraging a shared Concept Atlas.

Method: The framework aligns unknown latent spaces to a labeled Concept Atlas using shared inputs and lightweight representational alignment techniques, eliminating the need for labeled concept data.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation capabilities in previously opaque models.

Conclusion: Atlas-Alignment amortizes interpretability costs, making new models transparent and controllable with minimal marginal investment.

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MVeLMA, an ML pipeline for predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss, outperforming SOTA models and aiding targeted recovery efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is crucial for ecological recovery but is hindered by time-intensive data collection and lack of interpretability in existing models.

Method: Uses a multimodal feature integration pipeline and stacked ensemble-based architecture with probabilistic modeling for uncertainty estimation.

Result: MVeLMA outperforms SOTA models and generates confidence maps to identify high-risk counties for targeted recovery.

Conclusion: The work can inform disaster relief planning, ecological policy, and wildlife recovery management.

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

### [207] [Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27484)
*Uzay Macar,Paul C. Bogdan,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that studying single chains-of-thought (CoT) is insufficient for understanding model reasoning. Instead, it proposes resampling multiple CoTs to analyze causal influence, model decisions, and interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research often examines only one chain-of-thought, which fails to capture the full distribution of reasoning paths models can take. The authors aim to provide a more robust understanding by analyzing multiple samples.

Method: The paper uses resampling techniques to investigate causal influence, artificial edits to CoT, resilience of reasoning steps, and unfaithful CoT scenarios.

Result: Key findings include: self-preservation sentences have minimal causal impact, off-policy interventions are unstable, critical planning steps resist removal, and hints exert subtle influence even when removed.

Conclusion: Studying distributions via resampling offers reliable causal analysis, clearer insights into model reasoning, and principled methods for CoT interventions.

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

*Angelica Liguori,Ettore Ritacco,Pietro Sabatino,Annalisa Socievole*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Summary: The Spectral Preservation Network is introduced as a novel framework for graph representation learning, addressing limitations of Graph Neural Networks like fixed structures and over-smoothing. It uses Joint Graph Evolution layers and Spectral Concordance loss to adaptively transform graphs efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Networks suffer from rigid structures and over-smoothing issues, limiting their effectiveness in graph learning tasks. The goal is to develop a flexible, spectral-preserving method for graph representation learning.

Method: Method: The Spectral Preservation Network employs Joint Graph Evolution layers to adaptively transform graph topology and node features, and Spectral Concordance loss to maintain spectral consistency.

Result: Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node-level sparsification tasks, demonstrating superior performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion: The Spectral Preservation Network successfully addresses key challenges in graph learning, offering a flexible and efficient solution for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social
networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks,
particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph
learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and
susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network,
a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs
serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as
community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a
reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two
key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance
loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node
feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively
across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation.
The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both
the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level
sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance and clear advantages of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for learning and sampling from simplex-supported distributions using smooth bijections and Aitchison geometry, enabling Euclidean-space density modeling with exact discrete recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model categorical data effectively on the simplex while leveraging Euclidean space for density estimation.

Method: Maps simplex to Euclidean space via smooth bijections based on Aitchison geometry, using Dirichlet interpolation for dequantization.

Result: Competitive performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, respecting Aitchison geometry without custom noise processes.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical and efficient approach for simplex-based density modeling in Euclidean space.

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Kewen Zhu,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAdamW is proposed to address challenges in applying AdamW to federated learning, improving convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings leads to high variance, local overfitting, and slow convergence due to data heterogeneity.

Method: FedAdamW uses local correction and decoupled weight decay to align updates, aggregates second-moment estimates, and reinitializes them efficiently.

Result: Theoretically, FedAdamW achieves linear speedup convergence; empirically, it reduces communication rounds and boosts accuracy in Transformer models.

Conclusion: FedAdamW effectively mitigates challenges in federated AdamW, enhancing training efficiency and model performance.

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training
large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DP-FedPGN, a novel CL-DPFL algorithm that uses a global gradient norm penalty to find flatter global minima, improving model generalization and reducing gradient clipping errors while ensuring privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CL-DPFL methods degrade model generalization due to sharper loss landscapes. Existing solutions like SAM only address local flatness, not global flatness.

Method: DP-FedPGN introduces a global gradient norm penalty to local loss, seeking global flat minima and reducing gradient clipping errors. It also uses Rényi DP for privacy guarantees.

Result: DP-FedPGN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ResNet and Transformer models across six tasks, achieving faster convergence and better performance.

Conclusion: DP-FedPGN effectively mitigates DP-induced performance degradation, handles data heterogeneity, and ensures strict privacy, making it a superior CL-DPFL solution.

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a learning-based method using GNNs to create GPU-friendly SPAI preconditioners for CG solvers, avoiding triangular solves and improving performance on GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional preconditioners limit optimization from data, and existing learning-based methods face GPU parallelization challenges due to triangular solves and long-range dependencies.

Method: Uses GNNs to construct SPAI preconditioners, avoiding triangular solves and leveraging matrix-vector products compatible with GNNs. Introduces a scale-invariant loss function aligned with CG's condition number dependency.

Result: Demonstrates 40%-53% faster solution times on GPUs, better condition numbers, and superior generalization on PDE-derived and synthetic datasets compared to standard and previous learning-based preconditioners.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses GPU parallelization challenges, outperforms existing approaches, and offers broad applicability with improved performance.

Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving
symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective
preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners
rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while
limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing
learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve
the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on
incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated
triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces
long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these
issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly
preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate
Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires
only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector
product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The
flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss
function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on
the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved
performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived
datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous
learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by
40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior
generalization performance. Source code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of general-purpose time series foundation models for domain-specific biomedical signals like EEG, which has been underutilized.

Method: Tested two pretraining approaches: one using heterogeneous real-world time series and another using purely synthetic data. Evaluated on EEG tasks including motor imagery classification and sleep stage prediction.

Result: Both pretraining variants outperformed EEGNet and CBraMod, demonstrating effective transfer of generalist models to EEG tasks.

Conclusion: Generalist time series foundation models, even with non-EEG or synthetic pretraining, show promise for EEG analysis, indicating potential benefits from cross-domain advances.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

*J. Poole,N. Dervilis,K. Worden,P. Gardner,V. Giglioni,R. S. Mills,A. J. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian framework for domain adaptation (DA) in population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM), integrating active sampling to reduce labeled data needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training SHM systems with labeled data is costly. PBSHM leverages data from multiple structures, but distribution differences cause generalization errors.

Method: A Bayesian DA framework improves unsupervised mappings with limited labeled data, combined with active sampling to guide inspections.

Result: Combining transfer learning and active learning enhances data efficiency for classification models in label-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach reduces required inspections and operational costs, benefiting data-informed maintenance.

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be

Conclusion: TetraJet-v2 advances low-precision LLM training by effectively addressing key challenges, offering a significant efficiency gain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AstuteRAG-FQA is an adaptive RAG framework designed for Financial Question Answering, addressing challenges like proprietary data access, retrieval accuracy, and regulatory constraints through task-aware prompt engineering, hybrid retrieval, and multi-layered security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the limitations of RAG in finance, such as restricted data access, retrieval accuracy issues, and regulatory compliance, to improve domain specificity and reduce hallucinations.

Method: The method involves a hybrid retrieval strategy combining open-source and proprietary data, dynamic prompt engineering, a four-tier task classification system, and multi-layered security mechanisms like differential privacy and compliance monitoring.

Result: The framework evaluates three data integration techniques—contextual embedding, small model augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning—to enhance efficiency and feasibility in financial environments.

Conclusion: AstuteRAG-FQA effectively tackles financial query challenges with adaptive retrieval, precise prompt engineering, and robust security, ensuring regulatory compliance and improved accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

*Zhuohan Wang,Ziwei Zhu,Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Yizhou Han,Yufeng Lin,Zhihang Lin,Angyang Gu,Xinglin Hu,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORGEval is a graph-theoretic framework for evaluating LLMs' ability to formulate optimization problems, addressing inconsistencies and computational costs of solver-based methods. It uses graph isomorphism testing and achieves robustness against numerical variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLMs in optimization problem formulation suffer from inconsistency, infeasibility, and high computational costs. ORGEval aims to provide a reliable and efficient alternative.

Method: ORGEval represents optimization models as graphs and reduces equivalence detection to graph isomorphism testing. It leverages a tailored Weisfeiler-Lehman test and an SD detection algorithm.

Result: ORGEval achieves 100% consistency across random parameter configurations and outperforms solver-based methods in runtime, especially for difficult problems.

Conclusion: ORGEval successfully evaluates LLMs' optimization modeling capabilities, revealing DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 as top performers under direct prompting.

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

### [218] [Panprediction: Optimal Predictions for Any Downstream Task and Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27638)
*Sivaraman Balakrishnan,Nika Haghtalab,Daniel Hsu,Brian Lee,Eric Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes panprediction, a framework where models are trained to handle multiple downstream tasks and losses, showing it can be as statistically efficient as single-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize classical supervised learning by enabling models to adapt to various tasks and losses without retraining.

Method: Designs algorithms for deterministic and randomized panpredictors with sample complexities Õ(1/ε³) and Õ(1/ε²), respectively, using step calibration.

Result: Demonstrates that panprediction can statistically match single-task learning efficiency and improves deterministic omniprediction sample complexity.

Conclusion: Panprediction offers a flexible and efficient approach for handling multiple tasks and losses simultaneously.

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

*Jakob Hackstein,Sidney Bender*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes using Explainable AI to address class imbalance by identifying and eliminating Clever Hans effects, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in machine learning often leads to unreliable classification, with existing methods focusing on data or loss reweighting. The paper highlights how imbalance amplifies Clever Hans effects, a perspective often overlooked.

Method: Uses a counterfactual explanations-based approach within Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate Clever Hans effects under class imbalance.

Result: Demonstrates competitive classification performance on three datasets and shows how Clever Hans effects emerge under imbalance.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses class imbalance by leveraging Explainable AI, providing insights into Clever Hans effects that existing methods miss.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently
leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on
data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that
amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes.
In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three
datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective
largely overlooked by existing approaches.

### [220] [Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651)
*Shuyan Lyu,Zhanzimo Wu,Junliang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a biologically plausible layer-wise training method for DNNs using DIB and Rényi's entropy, outperforming existing baselines and matching SGD performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNN training with backpropagation is biologically implausible and memory-intensive. Layer-wise training avoids these issues but lacks scalability.

Method: Proposes a layer-wise training approach using deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and Rényi's entropy, with auxiliary classifiers for minimal sufficient representations.

Result: Validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and traffic sign recognition, achieving competitive performance with SGD and surpassing layer-wise baselines.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, bridging the gap between layer-wise training and SGD performance.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text
information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial
trading. However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading
tasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we
propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic
market. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,
optimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of
market information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis
for positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising
from position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,
the continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of
multi-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance
short-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the
position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More
importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a
vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.
