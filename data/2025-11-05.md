### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA is a Vision-Language-Action model trained with a novel framework, featuring a latent action model, dual-level action representation, and mixed training strategy, showing superior performance in manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the alignment of language, vision, and action representations for improved robotic manipulation and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Develops a latent action model, dual-level action representation framework, and mixed training strategy combining robot trajectory data with QA datasets.

Result: Achieves competitive success rates on the LIBERO Franka benchmark and real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: iFlyBot-VLA demonstrates superior performance and plans to release part of its dataset for community research.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study evaluates foundation models like DINOv3 in fetal ultrasound imaging, focusing on distinguishing anatomically similar brain planes. Domain-specific pretraining outperforms natural-image pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess foundation models' ability to discriminate anatomically similar fetal brain ultrasound planes, addressing a gap in reliable biometric assessments.

Method: Curated datasets into FetalUS-188K benchmark, pretrained DINOv3 self-supervised, and evaluated via linear probing and fine-tuning with two initialization schemes.

Result: Domain-specific pretraining improved F1-scores by up to 20%, preserving subtle cues for plane differentiation.

Conclusion: Generic foundation models generalize poorly under low inter-class variability; domain-specific pretraining is essential for reliable fetal ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFMs like Clay, Prithvi, and DOFA show competitive performance (~2-5% variation) in flood mapping across sensors, with Clay often leading. Clay excels in fine detail retention and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to clarify whether GFMs outperform traditional models (e.g., U-Net) in flood inundation mapping by comparing their performance across sensors and data scenarios.

Method: Three GFMs (Prithvi, Clay, DOFA) and UViT are evaluated against U-Net variants using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data, focusing on mIoU performance and computational efficiency.

Result: Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). Clay shows slight improvements (~4%) over U-Net and excels in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: GFMs offer modest accuracy improvements with lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to U-Net, making Clay a preferable choice for flood mapping.

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

### [4] [Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998)
*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a learning-based method for image reconstruction from incomplete measurements, using deterministic sampling patterns and leveraging image invariances to match fully supervised performance with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised methods need fully sampled data, and self-supervised ones rely on random sampling. The paper aims to address fixed, incomplete sampling patterns while maintaining performance.

Method: The approach exploits multiple invariances of the image distribution to compensate for incomplete coverage of deterministic sampling patterns.

Result: The method achieves competitive or superior results in optical-resolution image upsampling for photoacoustic microscopy, using less ground truth data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between supervised and self-supervised methods, offering efficient reconstruction with limited data.

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks three Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for detecting Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging, showing superior OCR performance but mixed PHI detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve PHI detection in medical imaging by leveraging advanced LMMs, addressing privacy and compliance needs.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B using two pipeline configurations: text analysis alone and integrated OCR-semantic analysis.

Result: LMMs outperform traditional OCR models in text extraction (lower WER/CER) but show inconsistent PHI detection accuracy. Best gains occur with complex imprint patterns.

Conclusion: LMMs enhance OCR but require careful pipeline and model selection for PHI detection. Scalable, modular deployment is recommended.

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

### [6] [StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027)
*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StrengthSense, an open dataset of IMU signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities and 2 non-strength activities, collected from 29 subjects. It includes data collection, preprocessing, and validation details, comparing IMU-derived joint angles with video-extracted ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive datasets for tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors, which are essential for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power.

Method: The dataset StrengthSense includes IMU signals from 11 strength-demanding and 2 non-strength activities, collected using 10 IMUs on 29 healthy subjects. Annotations were made using video recordings, and joint angles from IMUs were compared with video-derived angles.

Result: The dataset provides validated IMU data for strength-demanding activities, with technical validation showing accuracy and reliability through comparison with video-extracted joint angles.

Conclusion: StrengthSense fills a gap in datasets for strength-demanding activities, offering a resource for advancing human activity recognition algorithms and fitness/health monitoring applications.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

### [7] [Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046)
*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an automated pipeline for synthesizing large-scale text-VQA datasets by integrating OCR, ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation, producing ~72K QA pairs from ~44K images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for text-VQA datasets is tedious and challenging; automation is needed to scale up using foundation models and mature OCR systems.

Method: Integrates OCR (text spotting), ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation into a cohesive pipeline for automated QA pair synthesis and validation.

Result: Successfully creates a large-scale text-VQA dataset with ~72K QA pairs from ~44K images, the first of its kind.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively automates text-VQA dataset synthesis, addressing scalability and reducing reliance on human annotation.

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

### [8] [Markerless Augmented Reality Registration for Surgical Guidance: A Multi-Anatomy Clinical Accuracy Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02086)
*Yue Yang,Fabian Necker,Christoph Leuze,Michelle Chen,Andrey Finegersh,Jake Lee,Vasu Divi,Bruce Daniel,Brian Hargreaves,Jie Ying Wu,Fred M Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed a depth-only, markerless AR pipeline for surgical guidance on HoloLens 2, achieving ~3-4 mm median error in live surgeries without fiducials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and clinical readiness of markerless AR guidance for small or low-curvature anatomies in surgical settings.

Method: Used AHAT depth aligned to CT skin meshes via depth-bias correction, human-in-the-loop initialization, and global-to-local registration. Validated with leg and foot models, then tested intraoperatively.

Result: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement (~0.8-1.2 mm error). Clinical trials achieved ~3.9 mm median error, varying by anatomy (feet: 3.2 mm; ear: 4.3 mm; lower leg: 5.3 mm).

Conclusion: The pipeline achieved clinically acceptable errors (~3-4 mm) without fiducials, enhancing markerless AR guidance for moderate-risk surgical tasks.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

### [9] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated pipeline combining instance segmentation and chamber ordering to analyze planktonic foraminifera growth from 3D scans, reducing manual effort while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding foraminifera chamber growth is key to studying environmental adaptation, but current manual methods are time-consuming and subjective.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline integrates instance segmentation (optimized for chamber features) with a chamber ordering algorithm to reconstruct 3D growth trajectories from CT scans.

Result: The pipeline reduces manual effort and maintains accuracy, though smaller chambers sometimes suffer under-segmentation. The ordering algorithm remains robust.

Conclusion: This is the first fully automated pipeline for foraminiferal growth analysis, enabling large-scale ecological studies.

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

### [10] [Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02144)
*Zhicheng Wang,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cascaded PCA and RPCA framework for accurate crack width measurement in pavements, addressing challenges posed by complex crack morphologies and rapid evaluation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crack width measurement is crucial for pavement integrity assessment but is hindered by complex crack boundaries and the need for fast, arbitrary-point measurement capabilities.

Method: The study introduces a three-stage method: crack segmentation, PCA for orientation determination, and RPCA for extracting the Main Propagation Axis in irregular cracks.

Result: Tests on three datasets show the method outperforms existing techniques in computational efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses current limitations in pavement crack width measurement, offering improved performance for maintenance evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

### [11] [Autobiasing Event Cameras for Flickering Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02180)
*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Waseem Shariff,Cian Ryan,Joe Lemley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an autonomous system for tuning event camera biases to mitigate flicker effects, improving face detection performance in various lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address flicker effects in event cameras without relying on external hardware or software, enhancing their performance in diverse environments.

Method: Uses a CNN to identify flicker spatially and dynamically adjusts camera biases. Tested with a face detector under varying light conditions and frequencies.

Result: Improved YOLO confidence, higher frame capture rates, and reduced flicker indicators (average gradient) by 38.2% (well-lit) and 53.6% (low-light).

Conclusion: The autobiasing system significantly enhances event camera functionality in adverse lighting, offering a hardware-free solution for flicker mitigation.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

*Jinhwan Seo,Yoonki Cho,Junhyug Noh,Sung-eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-stage pipeline framework for the GVQA task, achieving a significant improvement in HOTA score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the GVQA task requires robust multimodal models for complex reasoning and visual grounding, which the paper aims to improve.

Method: The framework decomposes GVQA into Video Reasoning & QA, Spatio-temporal Grounding, and Tracking, using a trigger moment from CORTEX prompt.

Result: A HOTA score of 0.4968 is achieved, surpassing the previous winning score of 0.2704.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively tackles GVQA by leveraging a trigger moment and a structured pipeline.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

### [13] [MM-UNet: Morph Mamba U-shaped Convolutional Networks for Retinal Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02193)
*Jiawen Liu,Yuanbo Zeng,Jiaming Liang,Yizhen Yang,Yiheng Zhang,Enhui Cai,Xiaoqi Sheng,Hongmin Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-UNet is a novel deep learning architecture designed for precise retinal vessel segmentation, addressing challenges posed by thin and branching structures. It outperforms existing methods on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis but is challenging due to thin, branching structures with varying morphology. Existing methods lack precision.

Method: MM-UNet uses Morph Mamba Convolution layers and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules to enhance topological perception and boundary awareness.

Result: MM-UNet achieves F1-score gains of 1.64% on DRIVE and 1.25% on STARE compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MM-UNet advances retinal vessel segmentation with improved accuracy and robustness, validated by superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

*Zhengjie Zhang,Xiaoxie Mao,Qihao Guo,Shaoting Zhang,Qi Huang,Mu Zhou,Fang Xie,Mianxin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops a language-enhanced generative model to synthesize amyloid-beta PET images from blood-based biomarkers and MRI scans, achieving high resemblance to real PET scans and improving Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and limited accessibility of amyloid-beta PET scans by predicting their spatial patterns from more accessible blood-based biomarkers and MRI scans.

Method: Used a language-enhanced generative model (driven by a large language model and multimodal fusion) to synthesize PET images from 566 participants' data (Abeta-PET, T1-MRI, blood biomarkers), evaluating image quality and diagnostic consistency.

Result: Synthetic PET images closely matched real PET scans (SSIM = 0.920, Pearson's r = 0.955) and achieved high diagnostic accuracy (0.80). Combining synthetic PET with blood biomarkers improved diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.79).

Conclusion: The model enhances Alzheimer's disease diagnosis by synthesizing realistic PET images from MRI and blood biomarkers, improving accessibility and clinical workflow.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

*Jiajia Li,Keyi Zhu,Qianwen Zhang,Dong Chen,Qi Sun,Zhaojian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel object-centric 3D reconstruction framework using SAM-2 and alpha channel masking improves strawberry plant phenotyping by reducing noise and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant phenotyping methods are labor-intensive and destructive, while current 3DGS techniques include unnecessary background noise.

Method: Utilizes Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking for clean reconstructions, followed by DBSCAN and PCA for trait analysis.

Result: The method outperforms conventional pipelines in accuracy and efficiency, enabling non-destructive and scalable strawberry plant phenotyping.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a superior solution for accurate and efficient plant trait measurement in agriculture.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces autoStrain, an automated pipeline for segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) estimation in TEE using deep learning, outperforming manual methods and showing clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLS estimation techniques are manual and resource-intensive, limiting efficiency. The study aims to automate this process using DL to improve cardiac function assessment.

Method: Two DL models (TeeFlow and TeeTracker) were compared using synthetic TEE data (synTEE) generated via SIMUS. TeeTracker, based on CoTracker, showed higher accuracy.

Result: TeeTracker achieved a mean distance error of 0.65 mm on synTEE data and clinical validation showed SLS aligned with references (mean difference: 1.09%).

Conclusion: AI-driven SLS estimation with TEE enhances precision and efficiency in cardiac assessment, with potential for broader clinical adoption.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

*Yiqin Zhao,Tian Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models improve accuracy and scalability in mobile sparse sensing, enabling better geometry-aware image warping and 3D scene reconstruction, though challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between sensing quality and efficiency in mobile sensing systems by leveraging foundation models.

Method: Investigate foundation models’ impact on sparse sensing using real-world mobile AR data, focusing on geometry-aware image warping.

Result: Foundation models significantly enhance geometry-aware image warping and scalability, outperforming in 3D scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for mobile sparse sensing but face integration challenges.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

*Delin Ma,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multimodal neuroimaging fusion framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, addressing cross-modal complementarity and modality-specific features while improving representation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial, and existing multimodal fusion methods overlook modality-specific features and suffer from biased representations due to distributional differences.

Method: The proposed framework includes a learnable parameter representation block, shared and modality-independent encoders, and a consistency-guided mechanism to align latent distributions across MRI and PET modalities.

Result: Experiments on the ADNI dataset show superior diagnostic performance compared to existing fusion methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates multimodal features while preserving modality-specific information and aligning latent distributions, enhancing AD diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

*Hao Li,Daiwei Lu,Jesse d'Almeida,Dilara Isik,Ehsan Khodapanah Aghdam,Nick DiSanto,Ayberk Acar,Susheela Sharma,Jie Ying Wu,Robert J. Webster III,Ipek Oguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a latent feature alignment method for monocular depth estimation (MDE) in endoscopic surgery, addressing domain gaps between synthetic and real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning for MDE in surgical scenes is limited due to difficulty in obtaining metric depth from real endoscopic images. Existing domain adaptation methods still leave gaps.

Method: Uses adversarial learning and directional feature consistency to align latent features between synthetic and real endoscopic images.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art MDE methods on absolute and relative depth metrics.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces domain gaps and improves depth estimation accuracy in endoscopic videos.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

*Yucheng Song,Yifan Ge,Junhao Li,Zhining Liao,Zhifang Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTSC-CIF, a hierarchical task decomposition framework addressing three key challenges in Medical Report Generation (MRG), achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of previous MRG models, which often address only one of the three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge, poor text-visual alignment, and spurious correlations from cross-modal biases.

Method: The HTSC-CIF framework decomposes the challenges into low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: feature alignment, cross-modal mutual guidance, and causal intervention to reduce confounders.

Result: HTSC-CIF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRG methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses all three challenges, demonstrating a promising direction for improving MRG models.

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Giorgos Sfikas,Konstantina Nikolaidou,Foteini Papadopoulou,George Retsinas,Anastasios L. Kesidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Euler angles for probabilistic pose estimation via Normalizing Flows, comparing their simplicity and utility against more complex parameterizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the ambiguity in object pose estimation due to sensor constraints or object symmetries by leveraging probabilistic outputs.

Method: The authors propose using Euler angles as a parameterization basis for a Normalizing Flows model, despite their known limitations.

Result: The paper suggests that Euler angles can still yield useful models for pose estimation compared to more complex alternatives.

Conclusion: Euler angles, despite their shortcomings, may offer practical benefits for probabilistic pose estimation models.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAIL-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that improves reasoning in multimodal large language models by teaching when and how to think, using dual rewards for reasoning quality and adaptive decision-making. It outperforms existing methods and reduces hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack supervision on reasoning quality and use uniform thinking strategies, leading to inefficiencies in simple and complex tasks.

Method: SAIL-RL employs a dual reward system: Thinking Reward for reasoning quality and Judging Reward for adaptive decision-making.

Result: SAIL-RL improves reasoning and understanding benchmarks at 4B and 8B scales, competing with GPT-4o and reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: SAIL-RL provides a principled framework for more reliable and adaptive multimodal large language models.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition is challenging due to complex spatial relationships between symbols. The authors aim to improve HME structure recognition by leveraging graph-based modeling.

Method: The approach combines a deep BLSTM network for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation classification to form an initial graph. A 2D-CFG parser generates all possible spatial relations, and a GNN-based link prediction model refines the graph by eliminating unnecessary connections.

Result: Experimental results confirm the method's effectiveness, demonstrating promising performance in HME structure recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based approach successfully models HMEs as graphs, improving recognition accuracy by refining spatial dependencies through symbol segmentation and link prediction.

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure
recognition.

TL;DR: Cycle-Sync is a robust framework for camera pose estimation, using a modified MPLS solver with cycle-consistency and robust loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve camera pose estimation by leveraging cycle-consistency and robustness, avoiding the need for bundle adjustment.

Method: Adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) for camera location estimation, emphasizes cycle-consistency, uses Welsch-type robust loss, and integrates outlier rejection.

Result: Achieves the lowest known sample complexity and outperforms leading pose estimators in synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync provides a robust and efficient solution for camera pose estimation, eliminating the reliance on bundle adjustment while improving performance.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAFD-CC, a method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection that enhances decision boundaries by decoupling features and fusing them with logit-based confidence, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods often ignore the correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for accuracy. GAFD-CC addresses this gap.

Method: GAFD-CC decouples features globally using classification weights, extracting positively and negatively correlated features. It then fuses these with multi-scale logit-based confidence.

Result: Experiments show GAFD-CC achieves competitive performance and strong generalization on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: GAFD-CC effectively refines OOD detection by leveraging feature-logit correlation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

*Jizheng Ma,Xiaofei Zhou,Yanlong Song,Han Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa introduces continuous cross-modal reasoning for VLMs, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional discrete token-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are limited by discrete linguistic tokens, which don't fully capture the richness of visual perception.

Method: CoCoVa uses a Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) for iterative reasoning, dynamic token selection, and multi-task training with contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction.

Result: It outperforms baselines, competes with larger models, and shows interpretable reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: CoCoVa bridges the gap between discrete language processing and continuous visual understanding.

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chemical reaction data are often not machine-readable, limiting AI applications in chemistry. RxnCaption addresses this by converting reaction diagram parsing into an image captioning task.

Method: RxnCaption uses the BIVP strategy, leveraging MolYOLO to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices, simplifying parsing into a natural-language description problem.

Result: RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics, with significant improvements in structural extraction quality.

Conclusion: The framework, dataset, and models advance structured information extraction from chemical literature, enabling broader AI applications in chemistry. Data and code will be released.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

TL;DR: A method for self-supervised moving object segmentation in radar point clouds using contrastive learning and supervised fine-tuning, improving label efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting moving objects is vital for autonomous systems like self-driving cars. Radar provides direct velocity measurements for segmentation but suffers from sparsity and noise, making annotation costly and time-consuming.

Method: Two-step approach: contrastive self-supervised representation learning followed by supervised fine-tuning with limited annotated data. Introduces a clustering-based contrastive loss with dynamic points removal for pretraining.

Result: The method enhances label efficiency after fine-tuning and surpasses state-of-the-art performance through self-supervised pretraining.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of radar point cloud segmentation, offering a cost-efficient and high-performance solution.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

Method: The algorithm estimates overlapping rates, groups target points into proximity-based categories (Gcl, Gmod, Gdist), and applies tailored correction methods (KBI, JKHE, HE).

Result: Tested on 1086 point cloud pairs, the algorithm demonstrates superior color consistency correction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method effectively corrects color consistency for point clouds, with adaptive grouping and tailored techniques ensuring better performance.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed

### [30] [Purrturbed but Stable: Human-Cat Invariant Representations Across CNNs, ViTs and Self-Supervised ViTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02404)
*Arya Shah,Vaibhav Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how feline and human visual representations align using various models, finding that self-supervised ViTs show the highest alignment, peaking at early stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how feline ocular anatomy influences visual representations compared to humans, focusing on cross-species alignment.

Method: A unified benchmark using convolutional networks, supervised and self-supervised Vision Transformers, with layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment and Representational Similarity Analysis.

Result: DINO ViT-B/16 achieved the highest alignment (e.g., CKA-RBF ≈0.814), indicating self-supervision bridges species-specific features early. Supervised ViTs and CNNs showed weaker alignment.

Conclusion: Self-supervised ViTs best align feline-human visual systems, offering insights into cross-species convergence. Code and dataset are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

*Wenyang Wei,Yang yang,Xixi Jia,Xiangchu Feng,Weiwei Wang,Renzhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IllumFlow combines conditional Rectified Flow and Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement, decomposing images into reflectance and illumination components to handle noise and lighting variations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in low-light image enhancement, such as lighting variations and noise, by leveraging Retinex theory and continuous flow fields.

Method: Decomposes images into reflectance and illumination, uses conditional rectified flow for illumination changes, and employs a denoising network for reflectance noise removal.

Result: Superior performance in low-light enhancement and exposure correction, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: IllumFlow provides precise illumination adaptation and customizable brightness enhancement, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

*Duo Xu,Hao Cheng,Xin Lin,Zhen Xie,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-stage code-driven pipeline to generate a dataset (ChartM$^3$) for complex chart understanding, improving model reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack coverage for complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks in real-world applications.

Method: An automated pipeline combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for chart templates and chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies to generate reasoning codes, enabling diverse chart rendering and question-related computations.

Result: The pipeline produced ChartM$^3$ with 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs, enhancing model reasoning and cross-domain generalization, even for smaller models.

Conclusion: The dataset and method significantly advance complex chart understanding, enabling smaller models to match larger-scale model performance.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating synthetic crop-weed images using Blender reduces the annotation burden for training deep learning models in agricultural weeding robots. Training on synthetic data shows a 10% sim-to-real gap, outperforming previous methods and demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization.

Result: Training on synthetic images achieves a 10% sim-to-real gap, surpassing prior methods. Synthetic data also shows superior generalization in cross-domain scenarios compared to real datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic agricultural datasets hold significant potential, supporting hybrid training strategies for more efficient deep learning model development.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding and scene interpretation are critical for robotics, but large models are often too computationally intensive for edge devices. Small VLMs are investigated as a viable alternative.

Method: The study evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs, focusing on smaller models deployable on edge devices, using a diverse dataset of real-world scenarios.

Result: The experimental evaluation highlights the potential of small VLMs, along with their challenges, weaknesses, and biases in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Small VLMs show promise for mobile robotics but require careful consideration of trade-offs between accuracy, inference time, and deployment constraints.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity
poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of
Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and

state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action
Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to
edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is
evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately restoring missing or occluded regions in satellite images is essential for robust image analysis, especially in very high-resolution datasets.

Method: KAO uses Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models, employing Latent Space Conditioning and Explicit Propagation for efficient and stable inpainting.

Result: KAO outperforms existing methods, setting a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration with scalable and high-performance results.

Conclusion: KAO effectively balances efficiency and flexibility, offering a superior solution for satellite image inpainting.

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

*Taiga Yamane,Satoshi Suzuki,Ryo Masumura,Shotaro Tora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVAFormer, a transformer-based method for multi-view action recognition in the STAR setting, outperforming baselines by 4.4 F-measure points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view action recognition methods don't suit the STAR setting, requiring a new approach to handle sequential action recognition while preserving spatial information.

Method: MVAFormer uses a transformer-based cooperation module with feature maps (not embeddings) and divides self-attention for same/different views to model multi-view relationships.

Result: Experiments on a new dataset show MVAFormer outperforms baselines by ~4.4 points in F-measure.

Conclusion: MVAFormer is effective for STAR settings due to its spatial-information-preserving cooperation module and multi-view attention modeling.

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of synthetic datasets and small-scale real-world datasets in object-centric inverse rendering and relighting, providing a more realistic and generalized resource.

Method: Captured 765 objects using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 controlled light sources, providing well-calibrated camera parameters, object masks, surface normals, and diffuse albedo.

Result: OLATverse offers high-fidelity appearance and large-scale real-world coverage, serving as a benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation.

Conclusion: OLATverse is a significant step toward integrating real-world data into next-generation inverse rendering and relighting methods, with the dataset publicly released.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly

Result: DetectiumFire demonstrates improved scale, diversity, and quality over existing benchmarks, enabling advancements in fire-related research and safety systems.

Conclusion: The dataset is released to foster AI community exploration and development in fire understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cross-view UAV localization framework using object detection and graph neural networks to address challenges like GNSS-denied areas and heterogeneous aerial image matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of UAVs in low-altitude economies and the limitations of GNSS-based localization in certain areas drive the need for robust cross-view localization methods.

Method: The framework utilizes object detection to extract salient features from UAV and satellite images, integrating a graph neural network to analyze inter- and intra-image relationships for accurate matching.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strong retrieval and localization performance across diverse datasets and handles appearance differences effectively, including larger modality gaps like infrared-visible image matching.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable and effective solution for UAV localization in challenging environments, with potential applications in various scenarios requiring heterogeneous image matching.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniChange is a unified change detection model leveraging MLLMs to integrate BCD and SCD tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CD models lack versatility due to limited knowledge from single-type annotated data, prompting the need for a unified framework.

Method: UniChange uses MLLMs for language priors, introduces special tokens ([T1], [T2], [CHANGE]), and employs text prompts for change category identification.

Result: Achieves top IoU scores (90.41, 53.04, 78.87, 57.62) on WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniChange demonstrates superior generalization and performance in unifying BCD and SCD tasks.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtychoBench is introduced as a multi-modal benchmark for ptychography, comparing SFT and ICL strategies. Results show task-dependent superiority: SFT+ICL for visual tasks and ICL for textual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the best domain adaptation strategy (SFT vs. ICL) for foundation models in specialized scientific tasks like ptychography.

Method: Compare SFT and ICL on PtychoBench for visual artifact detection (VLMs) and textual parameter recommendation (LLMs) in data-scarce settings.

Result: SFT+ICL excels in visual tasks (Micro-F1: 0.728), while ICL outperforms in textual tasks (Micro-F1: 0.847). Context-aware prompting is superior.

Conclusion: The optimal specialization strategy is task-modality dependent, providing a framework for effective AI in science.

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

*Kevin Qinghong Lin,Yuhao Zheng,Hangyu Ran,Dantong Zhu,Dongxing Mao,Linjie Li,Philip Torr,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VCode, a benchmark for visual-centric coding via SVG generation, and VCoder, an agentic framework to improve symbolic fidelity in SVG generation by leveraging iterative revision and visual tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding by advocating SVG as a compact and executable visual representation, inspired by human sketch-based reasoning.

Method: The method involves the VCode benchmark for multimodal understanding reframed as code generation, and VCoder, which augments VLMs with iterative revision and visual tools to enhance SVG generation.

Result: Frontier VLMs struggle with faithful SVG generation, but VCoder improves performance by 12.3 points over Claude-4-Opus, though limitations remain in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the promise of symbolic visual representation and introduces tools to advance visual-centric coding, with the benchmark and framework publicly available.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines

structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic

*Nicolas Schuler,Lea Dewald,Jürgen Graf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a pipeline for automated natural language report generation in mobile robotics using local edge-computing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable evaluation and acceptance of AI-integrated robotic systems in critical tasks like autonomous driving and care robotics.

Method: Utilizes multi-modal sensors and local models deployed on edge devices to generate reports without external services.

Result: Evaluated on diverse datasets (indoor, outdoor, urban), providing quantitative and qualitative results.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and privacy-preserving benefits of automated report generation for robotics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public
repository.

### [44] [LiteVoxel: Low-memory Intelligent Thresholding for Efficient Voxel Rasterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02510)
*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel is a self-tuning training pipeline that improves sparse-voxel rasterization by addressing underfitting of low-frequency content, reducing VRAM usage, and stabilizing training with adaptive pruning and subdivision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior sparse-voxel rasterization methods suffer from underfitting low-frequency content, dependency on brittle pruning heuristics, and VRAM overgrowth, limiting their efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: LiteVoxel introduces inverse-Sobel reweighting for low-frequency awareness, depth-quantile pruning logic with EMA-hysteresis guards, and priority-driven subdivision under a growth budget.

Result: LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by 40%-60%, maintains PSNR/SSIM and training speed, and preserves low-frequency details better than prior methods.

Conclusion: LiteVoxel offers a more predictable and memory-efficient training pipeline without compromising perceptual quality, addressing key limitations of sparse-voxel rasterization.

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

### [45] [Unsupervised Learning for Industrial Defect Detection: A Case Study on Shearographic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02541)
*Jessica Plassmann,Nicolas Schuler,Georg von Freymann,Michael Schuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates unsupervised learning methods for automating anomaly detection in shearographic images, comparing three architectures and highlighting the superior performance of the student-teacher model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on expert interpretation and labeled data in shearography, enabling scalable industrial adoption.

Method: Three unsupervised models (fully connected autoencoder, convolutional autoencoder, student-teacher feature matching) were trained on defect-free data. A controlled dataset with reproducible defects was used.

Result: The student-teacher model showed superior classification robustness and precise defect localization, outperforming autoencoder-based models.

Conclusion: Unsupervised deep learning, especially the student-teacher approach, holds promise for scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores deep learning architectures for predicting future brain MRIs from baseline scans, focusing on neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, and evaluates their performance across cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to predict future brain states from baseline MRIs, addressing gaps in existing approaches that focus on cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, and enabling individualized prognosis.

Method: Five deep learning models (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, ODE-UNet) are implemented and evaluated on longitudinal cohorts (ADNI, AIBL) to predict follow-up MRIs.

Result: High-fidelity predictions are achieved, with models generalizing well to external datasets, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance.

Conclusion: Deep learning can reliably predict voxel-level future MRIs, offering potential for personalized neurodegenerative disease prognosis.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

TL;DR: The UVH-26 dataset is the first large-scale, annotated traffic-camera dataset from India. It includes 26,646 images with 1.8 million annotations across 14 vehicle classes. Models trained on it outperformed COCO-trained baselines by 8.4-31.5% in accuracy, showing the value of domain-specific data for Indian traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a high-quality, domain-specific dataset for vehicle detection in Indian traffic conditions, addressing a gap in existing global benchmarks.

Method: The dataset was created using 26,646 images from 2800 Bengaluru CCTV cameras, annotated by 565 students via a hackathon. Consensus annotations were derived using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Various detectors (YOLO, RT-DETR, DAMO-YOLO) were trained and evaluated on the dataset.

Result: Models trained on UVH-26 showed 8.4-31.5% improvement in accuracy (mAP50:95) over COCO-trained baselines, with RT-DETR-X achieving the best performance (0.67 mAP50:95).

Conclusion: UVH-26 successfully addresses the lack of domain-specific data for Indian traffic and provides a foundation for advancing intelligent transportation systems in complex traffic conditions.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

*Md Rashidunnabi,Kailash A. Hambarde,Vasco Lopes,Joao C. Neves,Hugo Proenca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework for video-based person re-identification in cross-view domains, addressing challenges like viewpoint shifts and temporal inconsistencies with seven complementary modules. It achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of video-based person re-identification in cross-view domains is challenging due to extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. The goal is to enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without compromising computational efficiency.

Method: The proposed MTF-CVReID framework introduces seven modules (CSFN, MRFH, IAMM, TDM, IVFA, HTPL, MVICL) over a ViT-B/16 backbone. These modules address biases, scale stabilization, identity reinforcement, temporal encoding, feature alignment, multi-scale temporal learning, and cross-view identity coherence.

Result: MTF-CVReID achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude levels, with strong generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS datasets. It maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) despite adding minimal parameters and computational overhead.

Conclusion: Carefully designed adapter-based modules can significantly improve cross-view robustness and temporal consistency in person re-identification tasks while preserving computational efficiency. The framework demonstrates superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

### [49] [A Cognitive Process-Inspired Architecture for Subject-Agnostic Brain Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02565)
*Jingyu Lu,Haonan Wang,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCFlow is a hierarchical brain decoding framework that reconstructs visual experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, leveraging multi-dimensional representations and contrastive learning for cross-subject generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored area of subject-agnostic brain decoding, which has clinical potential but faces challenges in cross-subject generalization and brain signal complexity.

Method: VCFlow models the ventral-dorsal architecture of the visual system, disentangles features from early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, and uses feature-level contrastive learning for subject-invariant semantic representations.

Result: VCFlow achieves fast reconstruction (10 seconds per video) with a minor accuracy loss (7% on average), outperforming conventional pipelines that require extensive per-subject data and computation.

Conclusion: VCFlow offers a clinically scalable solution for subject-agnostic brain decoding, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

*Daichi Nagai,Ryugo Morita,Shunsuke Kitada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAUE introduces a training-free method for layer-wise image generation using noise transplantation, achieving coherence and quality without fine-tuning or datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professional applications need layer-wise image control, but current methods require fine-tuning or fail to produce coherent scenes.

Method: TAUE uses Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC) to transplant latent representations for consistent multi-layered outputs.

Result: TAUE matches fine-tuned methods in performance, ensuring coherence and quality without training.

Conclusion: TAUE enables accessible, controllable generative workflows and novel applications like compositional editing.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-animal tracking requires extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design, which is inefficient for diverse scenarios. This work explores zero-shot solutions to overcome these limitations.

Method: Combines Grounding Dino for object detection and Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for tracking, with carefully designed heuristics for adaptability to new datasets.

Result: Demonstrates consistent performance on ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and GMOT-40 subsets, proving effectiveness across varied species and environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-animal tracking without the need for retraining or hyperparameter adjustments.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

TL;DR: A light-weight CNN framework is proposed to detect face spoofing attacks, ensuring fast biometric authentication with a new dataset of over 500 videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, necessitating robust solutions for secure authentication.

Method: The paper introduces a novel light-weight CNN framework designed to detect print/display, video, and wrap attacks, validated with a new 2D spoof attack dataset.

Result: The architecture provides fast liveness detection (1-2 seconds on CPU) and is demonstrated effective with a publicly available demo.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an efficient solution to combat presentation attacks in face recognition systems.

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:

TL;DR: UniPruneBench is a unified benchmark for evaluating visual token pruning methods in multimodal LLMs, covering diverse algorithms and models, revealing insights like random pruning's strength and task-specific pruning sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer from inefficiency due to excessive visual tokens, but existing token compression methods lack consistent evaluation frameworks.

Method: Introduces UniPruneBench, a benchmark with standardized protocols across six ability dimensions, ten datasets, and ten compression algorithms tested on three LMM families.

Result: Key findings include random pruning as a strong baseline, no universally superior method, task-dependent pruning sensitivity (OCR most vulnerable), and pruning ratio as the main performance factor.

Conclusion: UniPruneBench provides a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers use fixed patch tokens that don't account for image spatial and semantic structure, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Introduces an end-to-end differentiable tokenizer using hierarchical model selection with information criteria for pixel-level adaptation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and supports raster-to-vector conversion.

Conclusion: The proposed tokenizer enhances Vision Transformers by adapting to image content, offering backward compatibility and improved task performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and
semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel VI-ReID framework called MTRL uses modality-transition representation learning without extra parameters, improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VI-ReID methods rely on intermediate features or images but fail to utilize them effectively, leading to performance gaps.

Method: The MTRL framework generates middle images as modality transmitters, aligns features using contrastive and regularization losses, and avoids additional parameters.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three VI-ReID datasets with no extra inference cost.

Conclusion: MTRL effectively addresses cross-modal feature alignment in VI-ReID, offering improved performance without computational overhead.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VidEmo, a framework combining affective cues-guided reasoning and a two-stage tuning process for video emotion analysis, supported by the Emo-CFG dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in VideoLLMs underscore the need for better emotion understanding in videos, addressing challenges posed by emotions' dynamic and cues-dependent nature.

Method: Proposes VidEmo models with curriculum emotion learning and affective-tree reinforcement learning, alongside the Emo-CFG dataset for training.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across 15 face perception tasks, setting a new milestone.

Conclusion: The VidEmo framework and Emo-CFG dataset effectively address emotion analysis challenges, advancing the field.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

TL;DR: LLEXICORP automates naming and explaining concepts in CNNs using multimodal LLMs, making explanations scalable and accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRP workflows are manual and limit the accessibility and scalability of explanations for CNN decisions.

Method: Couples CRP with a multimodal LLM to auto-name concepts and generate natural-language explanations, using crafted prompts for faithfulness.

Result: Effectively translates relevance maps into intuitive narratives for different audiences.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with CRP lowers the barrier to interpreting CNNs, enhancing transparency.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

*Tyler Zhu,Tengda Han,Leonidas Guibas,Viorica Pătrăucean,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores video-text representation alignment, analyzing the impact of data richness and proposing scaling laws, while linking alignment to downstream task performance and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the alignment of video and text representations, addressing gaps in understanding temporal data's role in cross-modal alignment and probing encoder capabilities.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive study using modern video and language encoders, analyzing data richness (visual and text), proposing scaling laws, and examining alignment correlations with downstream tasks.

Result: Found that alignment depends on data richness, with predictive scaling laws. Strong text alignment correlates with general-purpose video understanding, and temporal reasoning is linked to cross-modal alignment.

Conclusion: Video-text alignment serves as an informative zero-shot probe for encoder representation power in spatio-temporal data, offering insights for future research.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

*Antonio Oroz,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PercHead is a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic 3D editing, leveraging perceptual supervision and iterative cross-attention for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges addressed include severe view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and ambiguity in 3D editing. The goal is to achieve high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and intuitive editing.

Method: A unified base model uses a dual-branch encoder and ViT-based decoder with iterative cross-attention. Rendering employs Gaussian Splatting, and perceptual supervision is based on DINOv2 and SAM2.1.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis, robustness to extreme angles, and seamless extension for semantic 3D editing through geometry and style disentanglement.

Conclusion: PercHead offers powerful and intuitive 3D editing via a lightweight GUI, enabling effortless control over geometry and appearance.

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

### [60] [When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779)
*Yiyang Zhou,Haoqin Tu,Zijun Wang,Zeyu Wang,Niklas Muennighoff,Fan Nie,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Chaorui Deng,Shen Yan,Haoqi Fan,Cihang Xie,Huaxiu Yao,Qinghao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRA is a new benchmark requiring models to generate and use intermediate images for complex reasoning, showing significant performance gains when visual cues are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of text-only reasoning in models by introducing visual intermediate steps for solving complex problems.

Method: MIRA includes 546 multimodal problems with annotated visual images and final answers, evaluated under three input levels: direct, text-only CoT, and Visual-CoT.

Result: Models perform poorly with text-only prompts but improve by 33.7% on average with visual cues, highlighting the need for visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Visual intermediate steps are crucial for models to solve complex reasoning tasks in MIRA.

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

*Nusrat Tasnim,Kutub Uddin,Khalid Mahmood Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detecting AI-generated media like deepfakes by proposing a unified benchmarking framework to evaluate forensic methods systematically. It highlights gaps in current methods and evaluates ten state-of-the-art techniques using standardized metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated media, especially deepfakes, threatens multimedia forensics and public trust. Current forensic methods lack standardized benchmarks, training protocols, and evaluation metrics, hindering fair comparison and deployment.

Method: The paper introduces a unified benchmarking framework to evaluate ten forensic methods under controlled conditions. It uses seven datasets and multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC) and analyzes interpretability via confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps.

Result: Results show variability in generalization, with some methods performing well in-distribution but poorly cross-model. The framework reveals strengths and limitations of current approaches.

Conclusion: The study aims to improve understanding of forensic methods and inspire more robust, generalizable, and explainable solutions for detecting AI-generated media.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

TL;DR: PLUTO-4 introduces two Vision Transformer models (PLUTO-4S and PLUTO-4G) trained on a large pathology image corpus, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance pathology foundation models by scaling up and optimizing for diverse clinical tasks, leveraging large-scale multi-institutional data.

Method: PLUTO-4 includes a compact PLUTO-4S with multi-scale deployment (FlexiViT, 2D-RoPE) and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G for maximum representation. Both are pretrained with DINOv2 on 551,164 WSIs.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in patch-level classification, segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis, with PLUTO-4G improving dermatopathology diagnosis by 11%.

Conclusion: PLUTO-4 demonstrates transformative potential for clinical and research applications in pathology.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseMarks is a learned representation for human heads using a Vision Transformer to predict 3D embeddings per pixel, enabling high-quality dense correspondences. It's trained with a dataset of pairwise point matches and contrastive loss, achieving robust results across poses and individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust and interpretable representation of human heads for dense correspondences, addressing challenges like pose variations and coverage of the entire head, including hair.

Method: Training a Vision Transformer network to predict 3D embeddings for each pixel in a 2D image, using a dataset of pairwise point matches and contrastive loss. Multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, along with spatial continuity of embeddings, is employed.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The method is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head.

Conclusion: DenseMarks provides a consistent and interpretable 3D representation for human heads, applicable to tasks like semantic part matching and head tracking, with public availability of code and models.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

*Joseph Suh,Suhong Moon,Serina Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEMS, a graph-based model for human simulation, showing it outperforms or matches large language models (LLMs) in accuracy while being significantly smaller and more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if smaller, domain-specific models can replace LLMs in simulating human decision-making tasks.

Method: Casts discrete choice simulation as a link prediction problem using graph neural networks (GNNs), integrating language representations selectively.

Result: GEMS matches or exceeds LLM performance in accuracy across three datasets, with superior efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: Graph-based models like GEMS offer a lightweight, efficient alternative to LLMs for simulating human choices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate humans, with
applications ranging from survey prediction to decision-making. However, are
LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We
identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices
among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass
strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We
introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete
choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging
relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when
needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show
that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater
efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of
graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

*Kangyu Qiao,Shaolei Zhang,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IG-Pruning is a dynamic, input-aware pruning method for large language models that outperforms static depth pruning techniques by dynamically selecting layer masks at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of fixed block masks in depth pruning, which can lead to suboptimal performance across tasks.

Method: IG-Pruning uses semantic clustering and L0 optimization to discover diverse mask candidates and implements dynamic pruning without extensive training.

Result: The method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods.

Conclusion: IG-Pruning is effective for resource-constrained deployment of large language models.

Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),
efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.
Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the
computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.
However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead
to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we
propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that
dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two
stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and
L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the
need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making
it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: The study investigates inconsistencies in medical chatbots by developing an infrastructure to generate and evaluate queries, revealing low agreement among LLM evaluators and recommending multi-LLM evaluations for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address prevalent issues like hallucinations and biases in medical chatbots, especially when demographic information is involved, ensuring consistent advice.

Method: Developed a pipeline for generating realistic medical queries and evaluating LLM responses using multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts.

Result: Low inter-LLM agreement (average Cohen's Kappa κ=0.118) and statistically significant differences only for specific LLM pairs across demographics.

Conclusion: Recommends using multiple LLM evaluators and publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency and reliability in LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

TL;DR: LTD-Bench introduces a visual benchmark for LLMs, highlighting their spatial reasoning gaps by transforming evaluation from abstract scores to observable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations rely on opaque metrics, creating a disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities, especially in spatial reasoning.

Method: LTD-Bench uses visual tasks (generation and recognition) across three difficulty levels to assess spatial reasoning through drawings or executable code.

Result: Experiments reveal significant gaps in LLMs' spatial reasoning, even for high-performing models, undermining their use as world models.

Conclusion: LTD-Bench offers an intuitive, diagnostic tool for evaluating LLMs' spatial capabilities, bridging the gap between statistical and practical performance.

Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a
critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that
conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no
intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a
dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities,
particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We
introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation
from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models
to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach
makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts,
bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive
assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary
generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing
spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels,
methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial
mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an
alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional
benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional
mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that
undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's
visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential
approach to investigate model similarity.

### [68] [Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358)
*Wongyu Kim,Hochang Lee,Sanghak Lee,Yoonsung Kim,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Query augmentation improves query relevance by adding information, but current methods lack efficiency and adaptability. M-Solomon addresses these by adaptively deciding when to augment queries, leveraging multimodal LLMs for better performance and reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current query augmentation methods, while effective, suffer from unnecessary latency and performance issues for some queries. They also lack exploration in multimodal settings.

Method: M-Solomon divides queries into those needing augmentation and those that don’t, uses a multimodal LLM for synthetic augmentations, and adaptively augments queries only when necessary.

Result: M-Solomon outperforms baselines with and without augmentation, achieving better performance and faster embedding latency.

Conclusion: M-Solomon provides an efficient, adaptive solution for query augmentation, leveraging multimodal LLMs to enhance performance while minimizing unnecessary latency.

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

TL;DR: AyurParam-2.9B is a specialized bilingual LLM for Ayurveda, outperforming larger models due to domain-specific fine-tuning and high-quality datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream LLMs lack accuracy in specialized domains like Ayurveda, which requires deep cultural and medical expertise.

Method: Fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using a curated Ayurveda dataset with bilingual (English/Hindi) Q&A and rigorous annotations.

Result: Outperforms open-source models in its size class and competes with larger models on BhashaBench-Ayur.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and high-quality supervision are crucial for reliable AI in specialized medical fields.

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on

### [71] [AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02376)
*Aashray Reddy,Andrew Zagula,Nicholas Saban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoAdv is a framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking attacks on LLMs, achieving high success rates by combining adaptive mechanisms, revealing vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the vulnerability of LLMs to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks, which are more adaptive and effective than single-turn attacks, exposing flaws in current alignment strategies.

Method: AutoAdv employs three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager, a temperature manager, and a two-phase rewriting strategy, to automate and refine multi-turn jailbreaking prompts.

Result: AutoAdv achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns, outperforming single-turn baselines by 24%, and demonstrates vulnerabilities across multiple models.

Conclusion: Current LLM safety mechanisms fail in multi-turn scenarios, underscoring the need for defenses optimized for extended conversations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

*Kentaro Ueda,François Portet,Hirohiko Suwa,Keiichi Yasumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training (CPT) experts to enhance LLMs for specialized domains like finance, proposing a three-stage evaluation and testing three merging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in specialized domains requiring diverse skills (e.g., finance, math, multilingual processing). Merging CPT experts offers a practical alternative to costly multi-skill training.

Method: Three-stage evaluation (knowledge recovery, complementarity, emergence) and testing of three merging methods (Task Arithmetic, TIES, DARE-TIES) on a financial benchmark from 18 tasks.

Result: Merging experts with base models recovers lost general knowledge, while merging experts improves performance and enables emergent skills. Task Arithmetic is strong but sensitive; TIES is robust.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational insights into CPT model merging, offering a framework and guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing expertise.

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like
finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,
and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training
(CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable
multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and
Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,
complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task
Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated
from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an
expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while
merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain
skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is
hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also
suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent
skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first
foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework
and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing
assets.

### [73] [Prompting for Policy: Forecasting Macroeconomic Scenarios with Synthetic LLM Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02458)
*Giulia Iadisernia,Carolina Camassa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether persona-based prompting enhances GPT-4o's macroeconomic forecasting accuracy compared to human experts, finding similar performance but no added value from personas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if persona descriptions in prompts improve LLM performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks.

Method: Used 2,368 economics-related personas from PersonaHub to prompt GPT-4o, comparing forecasts against human experts and baseline prompts across four variables and horizons.

Result: GPT-4o matches human accuracy closely, with no measurable benefit from personas. Out-of-sample performance remains competitive but differs from in-sample results.

Conclusion: Persona descriptions are unnecessary for accuracy, and GPT-4o can forecast competitively with relevant context data.

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

*Kenza Khelkhal,Dihia Lanasri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smart-Hiring is an NLP pipeline automating resume screening and job matching, using document parsing and contextual embeddings for accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual resume screening is time-consuming, error-prone, and biased; automation can improve efficiency and fairness.

Method: Combines document parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual embeddings to encode resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space.

Result: Achieves competitive matching accuracy with interpretability on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, fair NLP framework for recruitment, with potential for bias mitigation.

Abstract: Hiring processes often involve the manual screening of hundreds of resumes
for each job, a task that is time and effort consuming, error-prone, and
subject to human bias. This paper presents Smart-Hiring, an end-to-end Natural
Language Processing (NLP) pipeline de- signed to automatically extract
structured information from unstructured resumes and to semantically match
candidates with job descriptions. The proposed system combines document
parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to
capture skills, experience, and qualifications. Using advanced NLP technics,
Smart-Hiring encodes both resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space
to compute similarity scores between candidates and job postings. The pipeline
is modular and explainable, allowing users to inspect extracted entities and
matching rationales. Experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset of
resumes and job descriptions spanning multiple professional domains,
demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach. The
system achieves competitive matching accuracy while preserving a high degree of
interpretability and transparency in its decision process. This work introduces
a scalable and practical NLP frame- work for recruitment analytics and outlines
promising directions for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and
large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

TL;DR: Analysis of lexical errors in Google Translate's English-to-Romanian translations of Covid-19-related texts, aiming to improve translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and fluency of Machine Translation (MT) systems like Google Translate by identifying and reducing lexical errors in translations of critical health information.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of 230 English-to-Romanian translated texts from WHO, Gavi, and patient information leaflets, focusing on lexical errors.

Result: Identification of common lexical errors in translations, contributing to the improvement of Google Translate's performance for health-related content.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better lexical selection in MT systems to ensure accurate and reliable translations of official health information.

Abstract: The research explores error analysis in the performance of translating by
Machine Translation from English into Romanian, and it focuses on lexical
errors found in texts which include official information, provided by the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi Organization, by the patient information
leaflet (the information about the active ingredients of the vaccines or the
medication, the indications, the dosage instructions, the storage instructions,
the side effects and warning, etc.). All of these texts are related to Covid-19
and have been translated by Google Translate, a multilingual Machine
Translation that was created by Google. In the last decades, Google has
actively worked to develop a more accurate and fluent automatic translation
system. This research, specifically focused on improving Google Translate, aims
to enhance the overall quality of Machine Translation by achieving better
lexical selection and by reducing errors. The investigation involves a
comprehensive analysis of 230 texts that have been translated from English into
Romanian.

*Max Norris,Kobi Gal,Sahan Bulathwela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes NTKT, a new method for knowledge tracing using LLMs to include question text, improving performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT models ignore question text, missing valuable insights and limiting predictive accuracy.

Method: Reframes KT as next-token prediction using LLMs, representing student histories and question content as text sequences.

Result: NTKT outperforms state-of-the-art KT models, especially in cold-start scenarios.

Conclusion: Including question text and leveraging LLMs enhances KT performance and generalization.

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

### [77] [CGES: Confidence-Guided Early Stopping for Efficient and Accurate Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02603)
*Ehsan Aghazadeh,Ahmad Ghasemi,Hedyeh Beyhaghi,Hossein Pishro-Nik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGES is a Bayesian framework that reduces the number of LLM calls by 69% while maintaining accuracy, using adaptive stopping based on confidence signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-consistency strategies for LLMs require fixed calls and can fail for rare correct answers.

Method: CGES uses confidence signals (token probabilities or reward models) to form posteriors and stops sampling once a candidate's posterior exceeds a threshold.

Result: CGES reduces average calls by 69% (e.g., from 16.0 to 4.9) while matching self-consistency accuracy within 0.06%.

Conclusion: CGES efficiently balances accuracy and computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time,
with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this
self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls
and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided
Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over
candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token
probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the
posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical
guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy
confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average
number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while
matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

*Aakash Sen Sharma,Debdeep Sanyal,Vivek Srivastava,Shirish Karande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for dynamically re-aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with evolving human values and policies, addressing the Alignment-Reality Gap effectively without degrading model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning LLMs with human values are static, brittle, and costly, failing to adapt to evolving norms and policies, creating the Alignment-Reality Gap.

Method: TRACE introduces a programmatic approach to unlearning by triaging existing preference data, identifying conflicts, and applying a hybrid optimization to preserve model performance while updating policies.

Result: TRACE successfully re-aligns diverse LLMs (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B) under complex policy shifts without degrading general capabilities, as demonstrated on synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset.

Conclusion: TRACE provides a scalable, dynamic, and cost-effective solution for maintaining LLM alignment, enabling sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to
their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and
costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and
policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a
growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:
large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning
methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise
policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict
Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives
re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE
programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,
identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a
hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences
while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE
achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,
Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF
dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without
degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and
cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation
for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

### [79] [Understanding New-Knowledge-Induced Factual Hallucinations in LLMs: Analysis, Solution, and Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02626)
*Renfei Dang,Peng Hu,Changjiang Gao,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how introducing new knowledge during LLM fine-tuning causes factual hallucinations, identifies high unfamiliarity as a key driver, and proposes KnownPatch to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore specific manifestations and mechanisms of factual hallucinations in LLMs when fine-tuned with new knowledge, a gap not deeply studied before.

Method: Uses a controlled dataset (Biography-Reasoning) for fine-grained analysis across knowledge types and tasks, and proposes KnownPatch to mitigate hallucinations.

Result: High unfamiliarity of a knowledge type drives hallucinations, affecting other types in QA tasks. KnownPatch alleviates this by patching known knowledge samples.

Conclusion: KnownPatch effectively mitigates hallucinations by restoring attention to key entities, improving model performance.

Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when
tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.
However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific
manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work
addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and
conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task
types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning
tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge
type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased
hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a
particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,
is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect
other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we
propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in
the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced
hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge
reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing
excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of
hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar
contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar
questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge
learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved
performance.

*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called optimal singular damage to efficiently store fine-tuned updates in large language models by combining low-rank approximation and sparsification, achieving better accuracy and storage efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are resource-intensive, and storing fine-tuned versions is challenging due to their size. Fine-tuning affects only a small fraction of parameters, creating an opportunity for efficient storage solutions.

Method: The method leverages the observation that fine-tuning updates are low-rank and sparse. It introduces optimal singular damage, which selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated updates to retain impactful components, balancing storage efficiency and model expressivity.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method outperforms using low-rank approximation or sparsification alone, achieving significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining sparsification and low-rank approximation effectively addresses storage challenges in fine-tuned LLMs, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PragExTra introduces a multilingual corpus and framework for detecting pragmatic explicitation in translations, identifying frequent explicitations and improving classification accuracy with active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translators often add cultural context to make texts understandable for new audiences, but this pragmatic explicitation has not been computationally modeled.

Method: PragExTra uses a corpus from TED-Multi and Europarl, identifies explicitation via null alignments, and refines detection with active learning and human annotation.

Result: Entity and system-level explicitations are most common, and active learning boosts classifier accuracy by 7-8 points, achieving up to 0.88 accuracy and 0.82 F1.

Conclusion: PragExTra makes pragmatic explicitation measurable and advances culturally aware machine translation.

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit
cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as
pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but
rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual
corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers
eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as
entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We
identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined
using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and
system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning
improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88
accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic
explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step
towards building culturally aware machine translation. Keywords: translation,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI adoption is lower in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs) due to poor performance of LLMs in low-resource languages, with a 20% deficit in user share.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why AI adoption is uneven globally, particularly in LRLCs, and to test if language accessibility is a barrier.

Method: Used a weighted regression model to isolate the impact of language from other factors like socioeconomic and demographic variables.

Result: Found that LRLCs have ~20% fewer AI users due to poor LLM performance in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI diffusion.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoRL, a centralized reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multiple LLMs to optimize task performance and control inference costs under varying budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized multi-agent LLM systems incur high and uncontrolled costs. The goal is to create a cost-efficient, centralized system where a controller LLM selectively coordinates expert models.

Method: The authors propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework that balances task performance and inference cost by centralizing coordination and adapting to different budget conditions.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show CoRL outperforms the best expert LLM in high-budget settings and maintains strong performance in low-budget modes.

Conclusion: Centralized coordination via CoRL is effective for scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains
and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM
systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for
every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In
this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller
LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and
cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as
reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while
minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent
system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during
inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework
that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget
setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a
single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while
maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,
highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and
cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

*Hung-Ting Chen,Xiang Liu,Shauli Ravfogel,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMER, a retriever that generates multiple query vectors to address the multimodality of relevant documents, outperforming single-embedding models by 4x on synthetic data and up to 21% on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrievers use a single query vector, which struggles when relevant documents are multimodal (e.g., different interpretations of a query). This limits retrieval performance, especially when target documents are diverse.

Method: Proposes AMER, an autoregressive multi-embedding retriever that generates multiple query vectors to capture multimodal distributions. All vectors are used for document retrieval.

Result: AMER achieves 4x better performance on synthetic data and 4-21% relative gains on real-world multi-answer datasets, with larger improvements for less similar target documents.

Conclusion: AMER demonstrates the potential of multi-query vector retrievers, offering a new direction for improving retrieval systems by addressing multimodality.

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

*Qianhao Yuan,Jie Lou,Zichao Li,Jiawei Chen,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Le Sun,Debing Zhang,Xianpei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemSearcher is a search agent workflow that maintains a compact memory to balance efficiency and accuracy in multi-turn interactions, outperforming baselines with significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between preserving information integrity and avoiding computational overhead in search agents.

Method: Proposes MemSearcher, which iteratively maintains compact memory and combines it with the current turn, optimized by multi-context GRPO, an RL framework.

Result: Achieves +11% and +12% relative average gains on benchmarks, with the 3B-based model outperforming 7B-based baselines.

Conclusion: Balancing information integrity and efficiency improves accuracy and reduces computational cost.

Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM
context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,
resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the
current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This
trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,
we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact
memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses
the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform
search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for
solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn
interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize
this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that
jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of
MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of
trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level
advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as
Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines
on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher
even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance
between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and

*Amanda Bertsch,Adithya Pratapa,Teruko Mitamura,Graham Neubig,Matthew R. Gormley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oolong, a benchmark for long-context reasoning tasks requiring detailed analysis and aggregation of text chunks, highlighting current models' struggles with such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about whether models effectively use full context lengths and to evaluate their ability to perform complex reasoning over large texts.

Method: Introduces Oolong, a benchmark with synthetic (Oolong-synth) and real-world (Oolong-real) tasks, testing classification, counting, and temporal/user relations.

Result: Frontier models like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro achieve less than 50% accuracy on Oolong at 128K tokens.

Conclusion: Oolong exposes limitations in current models' long-context reasoning and provides a tool for future development.

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

### [87] [Mirror-Neuron Patterns in AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01885)
*Robyn Wyrick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can develop mirror-neuron-like patterns for intrinsic AI alignment, using a cooperative game framework to identify conditions for their emergence and their role in ethical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI advancing toward superhuman capabilities, aligning AI with human values is critical. Current methods may fail against super-intelligent AI, prompting investigation into intrinsic alignment through mirror-neuron-like mechanisms.

Method: The study uses a 'Frog and Toad' game to promote cooperation, identifies conditions for mirror-neuron patterns in ANNs, introduces the CMNI to measure activation, and proposes a framework for future research.

Result: The findings show that scaled model capacities and self/other coupling can create mirror-neuron-like patterns in ANNs, fostering cooperation and suggesting intrinsic empathy-like mechanisms could enhance AI alignment.

Conclusion: Mirror-neuron-like patterns in ANNs could complement existing alignment strategies by embedding intrinsic empathy mechanisms, offering a promising path for ethical AI development.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

### [88] [When One Modality Sabotages the Others: A Diagnostic Lens on Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02794)
*Chenyu Zhang,Minsol Kim,Shohreh Ghorbani,Jingyao Wu,Rosalind Picard,Patricia Maes,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'modality sabotage,' a failure mode in multimodal models where a high-confidence unimodal error misleads the fused prediction. It proposes a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer to diagnose fusion dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack transparency in reasoning traces, making it unclear how modalities influence predictions or resolve conflicts.

Method: A diagnostic layer treats each modality as an agent, producing labels and self-assessments. A fusion mechanism aggregates these to identify contributors and saboteurs.

Result: Applied to emotion recognition benchmarks, the framework revealed systematic reliability profiles, distinguishing dataset artifacts from model limitations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a diagnostic tool for auditing multimodal reasoning, improving transparency and guiding interventions.

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

*Xinyi Lin,Yuyang Zhang,Yuanhang Gan,Juntao Chen,Hao Shen,Yichun He,Lijun Li,Ze Yuan,Shuang Wang,Chaohao Wang,Rui Zhang,Na Li,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-AI co-embodied intelligence system (APEX) that integrates human expertise, agentic AI, and wearable hardware to enhance real-world experimentation and manufacturing, achieving high accuracy and real-time error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between machine intelligence and physical execution in scientific and manufacturing workflows, which limits reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility.

Method: The APEX system combines human control with agentic AI for memory, reasoning, and planning, using wearable hardware for real-time feedback and mixed-reality guidance.

Result: APEX demonstrates high accuracy in contextual reasoning, real-time error correction, and effective knowledge transfer to beginners in flexible electronics fabrication.

Conclusion: The system establishes a new paradigm for agentic-physical-human intelligence, enabling autonomous, traceable, and scalable processes in research and manufacturing.

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

*Michel Ma,Takuma Seno,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter R. Wurman,Peter Stone,Craig Sherstan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using foundation models to automate reward function design for RL agents in Gran Turismo 7, combining LLM-based reward generation, VLM evaluation, and human feedback to create competitive racing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing reward functions for RL agents is challenging, especially in complex environments like autonomous racing. The paper aims to simplify this process using foundation models.

Method: The approach involves LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human feedback to refine reward functions for RL agents in Gran Turismo 7.

Result: The system produces racing agents competitive with GT Sophy, a top RL racing agent, and generates novel behaviors.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates practical automated reward design for RL agents, applicable to real-world scenarios like autonomous racing.

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

### [91] [Deep Value Benchmark: Measuring Whether Models Generalize Deep values or Shallow Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02109)
*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB) to test if LLMs learn fundamental human values or superficial preferences, finding models generalize deep values poorly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To differentiate between AI systems that generalize human values robustly versus those that mimic shallow patterns, critical for alignment.

Method: Uses a novel design with controlled confounding of deep values and shallow features, measuring Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR).

Result: Average DVGR across 9 models was 0.30, with larger models performing slightly worse, indicating poor generalization of deep values.

Conclusion: DVB offers an interpretable measure for AI alignment, revealing current models' limitations in learning fundamental human values.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

*Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Dan M. Frangopol,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent to improve flood insurance decision modeling, addressing LLMs' limitations in quantitative probability estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low participation rates in flood insurance among at-risk populations highlight the need for better behavioral modeling tools.

Method: InsurAgent integrates five modules (perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, mem) & RAG for empirical grounding.

Result: InsurAgent achieves accurate probability estimation & captures contextual info, outperforming traditional models.

Conclusion: InsurAgent is a valuable tool for behavioral modeling & policy analysis in flood insurance.

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Re-FORC is an adaptive reward prediction method that improves reasoning model efficiency by dynamically predicting rewards and optimizing compute usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning models by enabling adaptive reward prediction, reducing unnecessary computation, and optimizing model performance.

Method: Trains lightweight adapters on reasoning models to predict rewards as a function of future thinking tokens, enabling dynamic reasoning length control.

Result: Achieves 26% compute reduction with maintained accuracy, 4% higher accuracy at equal compute, and 11% accuracy boost in high compute settings.

Conclusion: Re-FORC effectively balances accuracy and compute efficiency, offering dynamic optimization for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

*Yibo Zhao,Yang Zhao,Hongru Du,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATHENA is a framework that combines symbolic utility functions and semantic adaptation to improve individual decision-making, outperforming existing models in tasks like travel mode and vaccine choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between individual and population-level decision-making in high-stakes scenarios like vaccine uptake motivates the need for a personalized, human-centric approach.

Method: ATHENA uses LLM-augmented symbolic discovery to find group-level utility functions, then adapts them semantically for individual choices.

Result: ATHENA outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and LLM-based models, improving F1 scores by at least 6.5%. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both stages.

Conclusion: ATHENA successfully integrates symbolic and semantic modeling, offering a new approach for personalized decision-making.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STRMAC is a state-aware routing framework for multi-agent systems, improving collaboration efficiency and reducing data collection overhead by adapting agent selection dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems suffer from rigid scheduling and inefficient coordination, limiting their potential for complex task-solving despite the integration of diverse agent expertise.

Method: STRMAC encodes interaction history and agent knowledge separately to adaptively select the most suitable agent at each step, and uses a self-evolving data generation approach for efficient training.

Result: The method achieves a 23.8% performance improvement over baselines and reduces data collection overhead by up to 90.1%.

Conclusion: STRMAC significantly enhances multi-agent collaboration efficiency and reduces training costs, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

TL;DR: The paper argues for optimizing AI agents along three dimensions (productivity, proactivity, personalization) and introduces UserVille and PPP, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach, showing significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses mainly on task success, ignoring user-centered interaction. The authors highlight the need for AI agents to optimize productivity, proactivity, and personalization for real-world effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces UserVille, an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators, and PPP, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach to jointly optimize the three dimensions.

Result: Experiments on software engineering and deep research tasks show PPP-trained agents outperform baselines like GPT-5 (+21.6 on average) in task success, strategic questioning, and adapting to user preferences.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for user-centered interaction is critical for practical AI agents, as demonstrated by PPP's success in productivity, proactivity, and personalization.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity
(task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and
personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

Motivation: Large language models struggle with complex tabular reasoning due to noisy data, intricate queries, and limited numerical capabilities.

Method: The framework includes a query decomposer, table sanitizer, and PoT-based reasoner, validated on the CalTab151 dataset to avoid data leakage.

Result: \method outperforms existing methods, improving accuracy by 8.79%, 6.08%, and 19.87% on TAT-QA, TableBench, and its own benchmark, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLM performance for complex tabular reasoning and integrates well with mainstream LLMs.

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a
robust solution for complex tabular numerical reasoning. These findings

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Ideation, a framework leveraging LLMs and a scientific concept network to generate high-quality research ideas, outperforming existing methods by 10.67%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for research ideation rely on simplistic approaches like keyword co-occurrence, missing contextual relationships crucial for novel idea generation.

Method: Deep Ideation integrates a scientific network capturing keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, using an explore-expand-evolve workflow and critic engine for iterative refinement.

Result: The framework improves idea quality by 10.67%, surpassing top conference acceptance levels, validated by human evaluation and ablation studies.

Conclusion: Deep Ideation effectively combines LLM-driven ideation with scientific networks, producing practical and novel research ideas.

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

*Zhuoran Zhang,Tengyue Wang,Xilin Gong,Yang Shi,Haotian Wang,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) handle conflicting information from different modalities, focusing on relative reasoning uncertainty and inherent modality preference. It validates this with a controlled dataset and entropy-based uncertainty metrics, revealing a universal law and mechanistic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacked fine-grained analysis of modality conflicts, ignoring model confidence in unimodal reasoning. This study aims to decompose and quantify the factors influencing modality following.

Method: The paper constructs a controllable dataset, uses entropy to measure uncertainty, and analyzes layer-wise predictions to understand the internal mechanisms of modality decision-making.

Result: A universal law is found: modality following probability decreases with increasing relative uncertainty. The balance point indicates inherent preference. Layer-wise analysis shows oscillation in ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how MLLMs resolve modality conflicts, disentangling bias from unimodal capabilities and dataset artifacts.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer architectures and temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering potential for personalized CKD care.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and
temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising
direction for personalized CKD care.

*Muhammad Sheharyar Liaqat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system is proposed to assess breast cancer risk using measurable clinical parameters, aiming to aid early diagnosis and improve survival rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is challenging due to disease complexity and varying risk factors. This study seeks to provide a non-invasive, accessible method for preliminary risk assessment.

Method: The system integrates BMI, insulin, leptin, adiponectin levels, and age as inputs, using fuzzy inference rules and soft set computations for risk estimation. Data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used for development and validation.

Result: The expert system demonstrates potential in identifying high-risk patients, supporting healthcare professionals in deciding the need for further diagnostic procedures.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a promising, non-invasive tool for preliminary breast cancer risk assessment, aiding timely diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women
worldwide, with early diagnosis being critical for effective treatment and
improved survival rates. However, timely detection continues to be a challenge
due to the complex nature of the disease and variability in patient risk
factors. This study presents a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system
designed to assess the risk of breast cancer in patients using measurable
clinical and physiological parameters. The proposed system integrates Body Mass
Index, Insulin Level, Leptin Level, Adiponectin Level, and age as input
variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and
determining the necessity of further diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.

### [103] [A New Perspective on Precision and Recall for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02414)
*Benjamin Sykes,Loïc Simon,Julien Rabin,Jalal Fadili*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework for estimating entire Precision and Recall (PR) curves in generative models, addressing challenges in their evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models' evaluation lacks comprehensive methods, and existing scalar metrics are insufficient. PR curves offer richer analysis but are hard to estimate.

Method: The authors introduce a framework based on binary classification to estimate PR curves, including statistical analysis and minimax upper bounds.

Result: The framework extends existing PR metrics and provides empirical insights into curve behaviors across different settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances PR curve estimation, offering a more detailed evaluation tool for generative models.

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

### [104] [ReAcTree: Hierarchical LLM Agent Trees with Control Flow for Long-Horizon Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02424)
*Jae-Woo Choi,Hyungmin Kim,Hyobin Ong,Minsu Jang,Dohyung Kim,Jaehong Kim,Youngwoo Yoon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReAcTree is a hierarchical task-planning method for LLM-based agents, breaking complex goals into manageable subgoals using a dynamically constructed tree structure with memory integration, outperforming baselines like ReAct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for embodied autonomous agents struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks due to monolithic planning. ReAcTree aims to address this by hierarchical decomposition.

Method: ReAcTree uses a tree structure with LLM agent nodes for subgoals and control flow nodes for coordination, integrating episodic and working memory systems.

Result: ReAcTree outperforms baselines, achieving a 61% goal success rate on WAH-NL with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Conclusion: Hierarchical decomposition and memory integration in ReAcTree significantly improve task-planning performance for complex, long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR improves reasoning in LLMs for structured tasks but struggles with open-ended ones. The study introduces VMR to adapt RLVR for open-ended tasks by reformatting data into verifiable multiple-choice questions, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods work well for tasks with standard answers but fail in open-ended domains. The study aims to extend RLVR's benefits to creative and instruction-based tasks by addressing the lack of verifiable rewards.

Method: The paper proposes VMR, which reformats open-ended tasks into multiple-choice questions with verifiable options, enabling RLVR training without ground truth.

Result: VMR achieves an average improvement of 5.99 points across eight open-ended benchmarks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VMR successfully adapts RLVR for open-ended tasks, demonstrating that reasoning enhancement can benefit creative and instruction-following domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

*Jorge Pellejero,Luis A. Hernández Gómez,Luis Mendo Tomás,Zoraida Frias Barroso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic AI as a paradigm for automating complex systems like 5G/6G networks, discussing its core concepts, design patterns, and a practical use case for RAN optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of 5G/6G networks makes manual optimization ineffective, prompting the need for Agentic AI to automate dynamic RAN decisions.

Method: The paper outlines Agentic AI's core concepts, design patterns (reflection, planning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration), and applies these principles to a 5G RAN case study using time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents.

Result: The practical case study demonstrates how Agentic AI enables KPI-based autonomous decision-making in RAN optimization.

Conclusion: Agentic AI shows promise for automating complex systems like 5G/6G networks, but further frameworks and definitions are needed to standardize its application.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

*Enhong Mu,Jinyu Cai,Yijun Lu,Mingyue Zhang,Kenji Tei,Jialong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KLPEG, a framework using Knowledge Graphs and LLMs to improve automated playtesting efficiency and specificity for incremental game updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automated playtesting due to rapid game updates and lack of structured knowledge accumulation.

Method: Proposes KLPEG framework: constructs a Knowledge Graph for game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships; uses LLMs to parse update logs and generate tailored test cases.

Result: Experiments in Overcooked and Minecraft show KLPEG accurately locates affected functionalities and completes tests faster.

Conclusion: KLPEG enhances playtesting effectiveness and efficiency for incremental game updates.

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORCA Benchmark evaluates LLMs on multi-domain quantitative reasoning tasks, revealing accuracy gaps (45-63%) primarily due to rounding and calculation errors, with strengths in math/engineering and weaknesses in physics/natural sciences. Models show partial complementarity, not redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' real-life quantitative reasoning across diverse domains (finance, physics, health, statistics) using verified calculator outputs, addressing gaps in numerical precision and domain generalization.

Method: ORCA Benchmark tests five state-of-the-art LLMs on 500 natural-language tasks, analyzing accuracy, error types, and domain-specific performance. Correlation analysis compares model error patterns.

Result: Models achieved 45-63% accuracy, with 35% rounding and 33% calculation errors. Strengths in math/engineering, weaknesses in physics/natural sciences. Models show partial complementarity (r ≈ 0.40-0.65).

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with numerical precision and domain generalization in quantitative reasoning, highlighting the need for improved step-by-step reasoning and error handling in diverse real-world tasks.

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

### [109] [Adaptive GR(1) Specification Repair for Liveness-Preserving Shielding in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02605)
*Tiberiu-Andrei Georgescu,Alexander W. Goodall,Dalal Alrajeh,Francesco Belardinelli,Sebastian Uchitel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive shielding framework for RL, using GR(1) specifications and ILP to dynamically repair safety and liveness properties, outperforming static shields in maintaining rewards and compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical shielding in RL is static and fails to adapt to violated environment assumptions. The paper aims to develop an adaptive shield that dynamically updates GR(1) specifications for better performance and safety.

Method: The proposed framework uses GR(1) specifications to capture safety/liveness properties and employs ILP for runtime repair of these specifications, ensuring adaptability and interpretability.

Result: The adaptive shield maintains near-optimal rewards and perfect compliance in case studies (Minepump and Atari Seaquest), outperforming static shields.

Conclusion: Adaptive shielding is effective for RL, balancing safety and performance by dynamically adjusting to environment changes.

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

TL;DR: A multi-agent psychological simulation system models cognitive-affective processes to generate human-like behaviors for training, grounded in psychological theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic simulations in human-centered fields by creating a system that aligns with human psychology and enables transparency.

Method: The system uses an 'inner parliament' of agents representing psychological factors, grounded in established theories like self-efficacy and social constructivism.

Result: Generates believable human behaviors applicable in teacher training and research, embodying principles like social learning and meta-cognition.

Conclusion: The system offers transparent, psychologically aligned simulations for effective training and research in human-centered fields.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DecompSR is a large benchmark dataset and generation framework for analyzing compositional spatial reasoning, allowing independent variation of key aspects like productivity, substitutivity, overgeneralization, and systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate the compositional spatial reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing a correct-by-construction dataset.

Method: Procedurally generates the dataset with independent control over aspects of compositionality and verifies correctness using a symbolic solver.

Result: LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalization in spatial reasoning but handle linguistic variation better.

Conclusion: DecompSR enables fine-grained probing of LLMs' compositional reasoning, highlighting their limitations and strengths in spatial tasks.

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: A study evaluates AI agent collaboration in maze-solving, revealing a 'collaboration gap' where solo-performing models degrade when collaborating. A 'relay inference' approach improves outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess effective collaboration among heterogeneous AI agents under partial observability, addressing the lack of empirical studies on large-scale agent-agent collaboration.

Method: Proposes a collaborative maze-solving benchmark isolating collaborative capabilities, modulating complexity, enabling scalable grading, and preserving ecological plausibility. Evaluates 32 models in solo and paired settings.

Result: Identifies a collaboration gap: solo-performing models often degrade significantly when collaborating. A relay inference approach (stronger agent leading first) improves outcomes.

Conclusion: Advocates for collaboration-aware evaluation, training strategies enhancing collaboration, and interaction designs eliciting latent skills, applicable to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

*Jiayu Liu,Cheng Qian,Zhaochen Su,Qing Zong,Shijue Huang,Bingxiang He,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CostBench, a benchmark to evaluate LLM agents' cost-aware planning and adaptability, highlighting gaps in current evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLM agents focus mainly on task completion, ignoring resource efficiency and adaptability, which are crucial for real-world applications.

Method: CostBench is introduced, a scalable benchmark in the travel-planning domain with customizable costs and dynamic events to test agents' economic reasoning and replanning.

Result: Leading models like GPT-5 struggle with cost-optimal solutions, with less than 75% exact match rate on hard tasks and a 40% drop under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: CostBench identifies weaknesses in current agents and provides a foundation for developing more economically rational and robust agents.

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

*Paul Castro,Nick Mitchell,Nathan Ordonez,Thomas Parnell,Mudhakar Srivatsa,Antoni Viros i Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'span queries' to generalize inference server interfaces, enabling optimization for diverse workloads like chat, RAG, and agentic tasks, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference servers are optimized for chat completion, limiting efficiency for evolving use cases like RAG and deep reasoning.

Method: Introduces span queries—expression trees with commutativity constraints—to generalize inference server interfaces and optimize KV cache and attention locality.

Result: Demonstrates 10-20x reductions in TTFT for non-chat use cases and improved accuracy with attention-optimized span queries.

Conclusion: Span queries offer a versatile and efficient solution for diverse inference workloads, outperforming traditional servers.

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of research in control engineering necessitates structured and formalized domain knowledge to enhance accessibility and collaboration.

Method: The paper uses the Imperative Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework and LLMs to transform natural-language descriptions and LaTeX-based math into a formalized knowledge graph.

Result: An 'interactive semantic layer' is created to enrich source documents, improving knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: This approach advances the goal of creating easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases in control engineering.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new

interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

### [116] [Optimizing AI Agent Attacks With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02823)
*Chloe Loughridge,Paul Colognese,Avery Griffin,Tyler Tracy,Jon Kutasov,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize attack policies in AI control evaluations, decomposing attack capability into five skills and using a probabilistic model to overcome data constraints, achieving improved attack strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI risk estimation by improving attack policy elicitation in complex, data-poor environments.

Method: Decompose attack capability into five skills, develop a probabilistic model for attack dynamics, optimize hyperparameters via simulation, and apply results to SHADE-Arena.

Result: Significant improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from 0.87 to 0.41.

Conclusion: The proposed scaffold effectively enhances attack policies for better AI control evaluations.

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

TL;DR: Kosmos is an AI scientist automating data-driven discovery, performing iterative cycles of analysis, search, and hypothesis generation with traceable reasoning, yielding accurate and scalable scientific findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating scientific research to overcome limitations of AI agents losing coherence and enable deeper, iterative discovery processes.

Method: Uses a structured world model to share information between agents, performing cycles of data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation over extended periods.

Result: Achieves accurate (79.4% accuracy) and scalable findings, equivalent to months of human research, with novel and reproduced discoveries across disciplines.

Conclusion: Kosmos demonstrates scalable, accurate automation of scientific discovery, bridging gaps in AI-driven research and enabling novel contributions.

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

### [118] [Neurosymbolic Deep Learning Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02825)
*Artur d'Avila Garcez,Simon Odense*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for using logic as a framework to provide semantics for AI, particularly deep learning, bridging neural networks and comprehensible scientific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI lacks semantics, making its scientific discoveries unsatisfactory. The goal is to formalize AI-based science to improve understanding and uncover new facts.

Method: The paper introduces a neurosymbolic framework using logic to link neural networks and semantics, reviewing existing encoding techniques and providing a formal definition.

Result: A framework for semantic encoding is proposed, making the mapping between neural networks and logic explicit and characterizing common approaches.

Conclusion: Logic offers an adequate framework for AI semantics, though challenges remain in identifying semantic encodings, akin to issues in philosophy of mind.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent-Omni framework leverages existing foundation models via a master-agent system for flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning, prompting the need for adaptable, omni-capable models.

Method: A master-agent system interprets user intent, delegates tasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates outputs.

Result: Agent-Omni excels in complex cross-modal reasoning tasks across multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: The modular, extensible design ensures adaptability and transparency, supporting future advancements.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,
audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support
continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

*Xun Wang,Zhuoran Li,Yanshan Lin,Hai Zhong,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoCo is a framework that transfers solo knowledge to cooperative learning in MARL, improving efficiency and performance by leveraging easier-to-obtain solo demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training agents collaboratively from scratch in MARL is inefficient, while solo experiences are more accessible. SoCo aims to utilize solo knowledge for better multi-agent cooperation.

Method: SoCo pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations and adapts it for cooperation using a policy fusion mechanism with a gating selector and action editor.

Result: Experiments show SoCo enhances training efficiency and performance across diverse cooperative tasks.

Conclusion: Solo demonstrations effectively complement multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and scalable.

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

TL;DR: CudaForge is a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and optimization, achieving high correctness and speedup over baselines, while being cost-effective and generalizable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CUDA kernel design is costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches leveraging LLMs for code generation. Existing methods often produce inefficient kernels and fail to generalize.

Method: CudaForge employs two LLM agents (Coder and Judge) to iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels using hardware feedback like Nsight Compute metrics.

Result: Achieves 97.6% correctness, 1.68x speedup over PyTorch baselines, and strong generalization across GPUs and base models. Costs significantly less than existing methods.

Conclusion: Multi-agent, training-free workflows like CudaForge enable cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization.

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Result: Achieves CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95 on AVEC 2019, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The RAG framework enhances emotional understanding and interpretability, improving depression detection performance.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and
multi-task learning baselines.

*Doulaye Dembélé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using eigenvalues entropy as an evaluation measure for classification, addressing issues with imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation measures for classification often perform poorly on datasets with imbalanced classes, necessitating a more accurate alternative.

Method: The authors introduce eigenvalues entropy as a new evaluation measure for binary and multi-class problems, linking it to common measures like sensitivity, specificity, AUC-ROC, and Gini index.

Result: The proposed measure outperforms standard evaluation metrics, especially for imbalanced datasets, and provides an estimate of the confusion matrix to mitigate class imbalance issues.

Conclusion: Eigenvalues entropy is a robust and effective evaluation measure for classification, particularly beneficial for imbalanced datasets, as demonstrated through various data examples.

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Conclusion: The framework offers a flexible and scalable solution for high-dimensional mapping, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Traditional methods for high-dimensional diffeomorphic mapping often struggle
with the curse of dimensionality. We propose a mesh-free learning framework
designed for $n$-dimensional mapping problems, seamlessly combining variational
principles with quasi-conformal theory. Our approach ensures accurate,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how quantum-inspired methods can enhance classical training of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging quantum superposition principles.

Method: Introduces Superpositional Gradient Descent (SGD), which links gradient updates with quantum superposition through quantum circuit perturbations, implemented using PyTorch and Qiskit.

Result: SGD achieves faster convergence and lower final loss compared to AdamW in synthetic sequence classification and LLM fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: The work offers insights into quantum-inspired enhancements for deep learning, though scalability and hardware limitations remain hurdles for broader adoption.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical
optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization.
However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical
training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent
(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising
results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this

TL;DR: Neural Green's Function (NGF) is a neural solution operator for linear PDEs inspired by Green's functions, achieving superior generalization across diverse geometries and functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generalizing learning-based solution operators for linear PDEs across unseen source or boundary functions and irregular geometries.

Method: NGF extracts features from a volumetric point cloud and predicts a decomposition of the solution operator for numerical integration.

Result: NGF outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators, reducing error by 13.9% and being up to 350 times faster than traditional numerical solvers.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust generalization and efficiency, making it a promising tool for solving linear PDEs.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires

TL;DR: DeepContour is a hybrid framework combining deep learning (FNO) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to optimize integration contours for solving Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs), achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional contour integral methods for GEPs suffer from computational inefficiency due to improper contour selection. DeepContour aims to address this by automating and optimizing contour design.

Method: DeepContour uses a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict spectral distribution and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to determine optimal integration contours, enhancing CI solver efficiency.

Result: DeepContour achieves up to a 5.63× speedup in solving GEPs across diverse datasets, demonstrating improved computational efficiency and numerical accuracy.

Conclusion: DeepContour pioneers a robust and efficient paradigm for solving high-dimensional GEPs by integrating deep learning with classical numerical methods.

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

*Qingyue Long,Can Rong,Tong Li,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel trajectory generation framework using a diffusion model integrates dynamic population distribution to improve realism, outperforming existing methods by over 54%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world trajectory data faces privacy, cost, and quality issues, while existing methods ignore population distribution's impact on mobility.

Method: The framework uses a spatial graph and a denoising network to capture spatiotemporal dependencies and population distribution effects.

Result: Generated trajectories closely match real-world data in key metrics, surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating dynamic population distribution constraints.

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FineXL introduces fine-grained natural language explanations for personalized image generation models, improving accuracy by 56%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalized image generation models lack explainability, especially in natural language, and existing methods are too coarse-grained.

Method: FineXL provides detailed natural language descriptions and quantitative scores for each aspect of personalization.

Result: Experiments show FineXL improves explainability accuracy by 56% across various personalization scenarios.

Conclusion: FineXL effectively addresses the need for fine-grained explainability in personalized image generation models.

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

TL;DR: The paper explores using pure reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance tool-augmented LLMs, proposing a dynamic reward design and Tool-Zero models, which outperform traditional methods by 7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in generalizing to unfamiliar tool-use scenarios, the research questions whether pure RL can better elicit models' reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce a dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL and develop Tool-Zero models, trained to autonomously use tools without post-training.

Result: The models achieve a 7% performance improvement over SFT and RL-with-SFT models, validated across diverse evaluations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of pure RL in enhancing tool-agnostic generalization for LLMs.

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a machine learning-based model to objectively determine sample size in qualitative research, addressing the ambiguity of traditional data saturation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reliance on subjective data saturation principles causes inconsistencies and threatens methodological rigor in qualitative research.

Method: Developed an ensemble learning model using ten critical parameters evaluated on an ordinal scale from five qualitative research approaches and trained multiple ML algorithms.

Result: KNN, GB, RF, XGBoost, and DT algorithms showed high explanatory power (~0.85 R2), validating key theoretical assumptions like research design type and information power.

Conclusion: Proposes a web-based computational framework to standardize sample size justification, enhancing transparency and evidence-based decision-making in qualitative research.

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

*Abdelaziz Bounhar,Hadi Abdine,Evan Dufraisse,Ahmad Chamma,Amr Mohamed,Dani Bouch,Michalis Vazirgiannis,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) trained for reasoning tend to be overly verbose. The paper shows that up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer, improving conciseness without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs becoming excessively verbose during step-by-step reasoning, which increases inference costs.

Method: The paper proposes retaining and modestly up-weighting moderately easy problems in the training pipeline to implicitly regularize output length, preventing runaway verbosity.

Result: The approach achieves baseline accuracy while generating solutions nearly twice as short, demonstrating emergent brevity.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances reasoning quality and conciseness without explicit length penalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

*Tiberiu Musat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking in neural networks involves delayed generalization post-memorization, explained via constrained optimization and small learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the puzzling phenomenon of grokking and its delayed generalization dynamics.

Method: Analyze post-memorization learning as constrained optimization, introducing an approximation to decouple parameter dynamics.

Result: Derived a closed-form expression for dynamics in two-layer networks, experimentally confirming delayed generalization.

Conclusion: Grokking's delayed generalization is explained by constrained optimization and small learning rates.

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

*Guillaume Tejedor,Veronika Peralta,Nicolas Labroche,Patrick Marcel,Hélène Blasco,Hugo Alarcan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel clustering method for ALS patients using a disease progression score outperforms existing techniques in survival analysis while maintaining interpretability for medical experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited effectiveness of current ALS treatments and the lack of well-defined patient clusters hinder personalized care. Small, heterogeneous datasets and sparse longitudinal data further complicate research.

Method: The proposed approach uses a disease progression declarative score to group patients, integrating medical expertise through descriptive variables. It explores various distance measures, including weak-supervised learning, and pairs them with clustering methods.

Result: Evaluated on 353 ALS patients, the method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in survival analysis and achieves comparable silhouette scores. Learned distances improve result relevance and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering method addresses gaps in ALS research, offering better survival analysis outcomes and interpretable results for personalized care.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

### [135] [COFAP: A Universal Framework for COFs Adsorption Prediction through Designed Multi-Modal Extraction and Cross-Modal Synergy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01946)
*Zihan Li,Mingyang Wan,Mingyu Gao,Zhongshan Chen,Xiangke Wang,Feifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COFAP is a deep learning framework for predicting COFs' gas adsorption without requiring gas-specific features, achieving state-of-the-art performance and identifying optimal structural properties for separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for identifying optimal COF structures rely on gas-specific features, which are inefficient and limit scalability.

Method: COFAP extracts multi-modal structural and chemical features using deep learning and fuses them with a cross-modal attention mechanism, eliminating the need for Henry coefficients or adsorption heat.

Result: COFAP outperforms previous methods on the hypoCOFs dataset and identifies that high-performing COFs have specific pore sizes and surface areas.

Conclusion: COFAP offers superior efficiency and accuracy for screening COFs, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

*Md Abrar Hasnat,Md Jobayer,Md. Mehedi Hasan Shawon,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A weighted ensemble model combining tree-based methods and CNN improves CVD risk prediction with high recall and clinical transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global health concern of CVD by developing reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk assessment.

Method: A strategically weighted ensemble model using LightGBM, XGBoost, and CNN, trained on a preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients with feature engineering and class imbalance management.

Result: The ensemble model achieves a Test AUC of 0.8371 (p=0.003) and a high recall of 80.0%, outperforming individual models.

Conclusion: The model combines robust performance with clinical transparency, making it suitable for real-world public health screening.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

*Prasanth K K,Shubham Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The EchoLSTM, featuring Output-Conditioned Gating and attention, outperforms standard LSTMs and rivals Transformers in efficiency and performance on noisy sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RNNs and LSTMs struggle with long-range dependencies and noisy data, necessitating a more robust memory system.

Method: Introduces Output-Conditioned Gating for self-reflection, combined with attention in the EchoLSTM model.

Result: Achieves 69.0% accuracy on Distractor Signal Task (33% better than LSTM) and 69.8% on ListOps (close to Transformer but more efficient).

Conclusion: EchoLSTM's self-reflective mechanism enhances robustness, making it a competitive and efficient alternative to existing models.

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

*Manuel A. Hernandez Alonso,Michael Depass,Stephan Quessy,Numa Dancause,Ignasi Cos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroClean is an unsupervised EEG/LFP preprocessing pipeline that automates artifact removal and improves ML model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG and LFP recordings often contain noise and artifacts, requiring automated, unbiased preprocessing to ensure reliable results.

Method: A five-step pipeline including bandpass/line noise filtering, bad channel rejection, and an efficient ICA with automatic component rejection using clustering.

Result: NeuroClean effectively removes artifacts and improves ML model accuracy from 74% (raw data) to over 97% in motor tasks.

Conclusion: NeuroClean is a promising, unsupervised preprocessing workflow for EEG/LFP data, enhancing ML performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

*Donghee Lee,Hye-Sung Lee,Jaeok Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bulk-boundary decomposition framework to analyze deep neural network training dynamics. It separates the Lagrangian into data-independent bulk and data-dependent boundary terms. This reveals intrinsic dynamics and stochastic interactions, extending to a field-theoretic formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clearer understanding of deep neural network training dynamics by decomposing the Lagrangian into intrinsic (bulk) and stochastic (boundary) components.

Method: Reorganizes the stochastic gradient descent Lagrangian into bulk and boundary terms, then develops a field-theoretic formulation based on this decomposition.

Result: Exposes local and homogeneous structures in deep networks, enabling a new field-theoretic approach to neural dynamics.

Conclusion: The bulk-boundary decomposition offers a novel framework for analyzing neural network training, with potential extensions to field theory.

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

*Aditya Sridhar,Nish Sinnadurai,Sean Lie,Vithursan Thangarasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TapOut is a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm using multi-armed bandits to dynamically select speculation policies for LLM acceleration, outperforming hand-tuned baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic speculative decoding methods rely on sensitive, hand-tuned thresholds, which are costly and generalize poorly.

Method: TapOut employs a meta-algorithm to select parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past rewards and exploration.

Result: TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups across diverse model pairs and datasets without hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed TapOut algorithm effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a robust and efficient solution.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

*Daniel Aarao Reis Arturi,Eric Zhang,Andrew Ansah,Kevin Zhu,Ashwinee Panda,Aishwarya Balwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores emergent misalignment (EM) in large language models, revealing a cross-task linear structure in how harmful behaviors are encoded, with shared parameter directions and functional equivalence across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the mechanisms behind harmful generalization in language models, specifically focusing on the phenomenon of emergent misalignment (EM).

Method: The research adopts a geometric perspective, analyzing EM through cosine similarities, principal angles, projection overlaps, and linear mode connectivity to identify shared parameter directions.

Result: The findings show strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with shared lower-dimensional subspaces and functional equivalence via linear mode connectivity.

Conclusion: The results suggest that harmful behaviors are organized into specific regions of the weight landscape, highlighting the importance of parametric geometry for interpretability and interventions.

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

*Rathin Chandra Shit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a path-coordinated framework for continual learning to address catastrophic forgetting, combining NTK theory, Wilson confidence intervals, and path quality metrics. It achieves competitive accuracy and reduced forgetting, with insights into NTK condition numbers and adaptive regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge in continual learning. The paper aims to mitigate this by proposing a framework that integrates NTK theory, statistical validation, and path evaluation.

Method: The framework unites Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory for plasticity bounds, Wilson confidence intervals for statistical validation, and multiple metrics for path quality evaluation.

Result: Experiments show 66.7% accuracy with 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, competitive with state-of-the-art. NTK condition numbers predict learning limits, and forgetting decreases over task sequences (27% to 18%).

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting, validates paths statistically, and offers insights into continual learning capacity limits and adaptive regularization.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

*Elham Gholamzadeh,Kajal Singla,Nico Scherf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict microbial interspecies interactions, leveraging monoculture data, interactions, and phylogeny. It achieves an F1-score of 80.44%, outperforming traditional methods like XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting interspecies microbial interactions, which are crucial for understanding microbial community structure and activity.

Method: Utilizes GNNs on edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions, trained on a large dataset of over 7,500 interactions across 20 species and 40 carbon conditions.

Result: The GNN-based model achieves an F1-score of 80.44%, significantly outperforming XGBoost (72.76%). It also classifies complex interaction types.

Conclusion: GNNs are effective for predicting microbial interactions, offering improved accuracy and the ability to classify diverse interaction types.

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

*M. Z. Haider,M. U. Ghouri,Tayyaba Noreen,M. Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM) combines classical and quantum methods to better model rare events, improving tail behavior and diversity in generated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events like financial crashes or climate extremes are hard to model due to their scarcity and heavy-tailed distributions. Classical methods often fail to capture or calibrate these events accurately.

Method: QEGM integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits, using a hybrid loss function and quantum noise injection. Training involves classical backpropagation and quantum parameter-shift gradients.

Result: QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by up to 50% and improves rare-event recall and coverage calibration compared to GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion models.

Conclusion: QEGM offers a robust hybrid approach for rare-event prediction, outperforming purely classical methods.

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flashlight is a PyTorch-based framework that automatically generates efficient, fused attention kernels for various attention models, outperforming FlexAttention in flexibility and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention implementations often require specialized kernels or manual tuning, limiting flexibility and efficiency. Flashlight aims to automate this process within PyTorch.

Method: Flashlight integrates with PyTorch's compilation workflow to automatically fuse and tile attention computations, supporting diverse attention patterns without static templates.

Result: Flashlight achieves competitive or superior performance to FlexAttention, while enabling rapid exploration of new attention models in native PyTorch.

Conclusion: Flashlight provides a flexible and efficient solution for attention computation, facilitating innovation in large language models without performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs with label-plus-explanation improves conversational response quality over label-only training. Surprisingly, even random pseudo-explanations enhance accuracy, suggesting structural benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if attaching explanations to labels during fine-tuning improves model performance in classification tasks.

Method: Fine-tune a 7B-parameter LLM using ensemble-generated data with label-plus-explanation or pseudo-explanation (random tokens) training. Evaluate across six datasets.

Result: Label-plus-explanation training outperforms label-only baselines. Even pseudo-explanations improve accuracy, indicating structural benefits.

Conclusion: Explanation-augmented fine-tuning enhances accuracy and reliability, showing that token-level scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

### [147] [A Dual-Use Framework for Clinical Gait Analysis: Attention-Based Sensor Optimization and Automated Dataset Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02047)
*Hamidreza Sadeghsalehi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework is proposed for gait analysis, serving as both a sensor optimizer and automated data auditor, revealing dataset biases and suggesting novel sensor synergies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hidden dataset biases and optimize task-specific sensors in gait analysis for neurological and orthopedic conditions.

Method: A multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework applied to a multi-cohort gait dataset for four clinical tasks.

Result: Identified severe dataset confounds (e.g., laterality bias) and proposed novel sensor synergies (e.g., Head plus Foot for PD screening).

Conclusion: The framework effectively audits dataset integrity and suggests optimized sensor setups for future protocols.

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

*Stefan F. Schouten,Peter Bloem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) to clarify its mechanisms, introduces 'relative contrast consistency' as the optimization target, and reformulates CCS as an eigenproblem for interpretability and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and applicability of CCS by addressing its partially understood two-term objective and sensitivity issues.

Method: Reformulates CCS as an eigenproblem to derive closed-form solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and extends it to multiple variables.

Result: The new approach matches CCS's performance while avoiding sensitivity to initialization across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Relativizing contrast consistency enhances CCS's interpretability and opens avenues for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

*Nimrod Megiddo,Segev Wasserkrug,Orit Davidovich,Shimrit Shtern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A solver is developed for maximizing binary-variable functions using an estimator trained on deviation from optimality, avoiding policy value calculations or solved instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently solve optimization problems involving binary variables without the need for calculating policy values or relying on pre-solved instances.

Method: The solver uses an algorithm that estimates optimal objective values from a distribution, training an estimator via an inequality-based loss function focusing on deviation from optimality.

Result: The solver avoids direct computation of policy values or dependency on solved instances while effectively estimating optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a novel approach to binary-variable optimization by leveraging deviation-based training, enhancing efficiency and practicality.

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

*Sékou-Oumar Kaba,Kusha Sareen,Daniel Levy,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to incorporate physical information directly into the loss function for machine learning tasks in scientific domains, improving performance and alignment with physical principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better leverage prior knowledge of a system's physics by integrating physical insights into the loss function, rather than just at the architectural level, for improved prediction and generative modeling in scientific applications.

Method: The authors derive energy loss functions assuming thermal equilibrium, using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution around the data. This results in energy differences between data and model predictions, ensuring physically grounded and symmetry-respecting loss functions.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves performance in tasks like molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Directly incorporating physical information into the loss function yields more accurate and physically meaningful results, while remaining computationally efficient and architecture-agnostic.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

*Lancelot Da Costa,Sanjeev Namjoshi,Mohammed Abbas Ansari,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular framework for structured world models using discrete and continuous building blocks, avoiding combinatorial issues by fixing causal architecture and limiting parameter search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmentation in world modeling research motivates a unified framework leveraging fundamental stochastic processes for discrete and continuous modeling.

Method: The framework uses HMMs and sLDS as building blocks, extending them to POMDPs and controlled sLDS for action integration. It fixes causal architecture to avoid complexity.

Result: The approach supports both passive (generation) and active (planning) tasks, achieving competitive performance with neural methods while remaining interpretable.

Conclusion: Scalable joint structure-parameter learning remains a challenge, but solving it could standardize world modeling like deep learning layers.

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

*Kishansingh Rajput,Malachi Schram,Brian Sammuli,Sen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online learning is applied to adapt ML models to non-stationary data streams in fusion, reducing prediction errors by 80% compared to static models. An uncertainty-guided ensemble method further improves performance by 6-10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models fail with non-stationary fusion data due to distribution drifts from experimental evolution and machine wear-and-tear. Online learning is underexplored for such applications.

Method: Uses online learning for TF coil deflection prediction. Introduces an uncertainty-guided online ensemble with DGPA for calibrated uncertainty estimation and meta-algorithm-based predictions.

Result: Online learning cuts error by 80%. The ensemble methods improve performance by 6-10% over standard online learning, with DGPA providing uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: Online learning and uncertainty-guided ensembles are effective for non-stationary fusion data, enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

### [153] [Geometric Data Valuation via Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02100)
*Rodrigo Mendoza-Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric alternative to Shapley data valuation using statistical leverage scores, which are computationally feasible and satisfy key axioms. It connects these scores to optimal design criteria and demonstrates their effectiveness in active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley data valuation is computationally infeasible at scale. The paper aims to provide a practical, geometric alternative based on leverage scores.

Method: The method uses statistical leverage scores to quantify datapoint influence in representation space, extending to ridge leverage scores for positive marginal gains.

Result: The scores satisfy Shapley axioms and provide a theoretical link to model performance. Experiments show ridge-leverage sampling outperforms baselines in active learning.

Conclusion: Leverage scores offer a scalable, principled alternative to Shapley valuation, with strong theoretical and empirical performance.

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

### [154] [Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Earth Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02101)
*Arjun Rao,Marc Rußwurm,Konstantin Klemmer,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) in Earth observation, revealing their compactness and sensitivity to spatial resolution and input modalities, and links this to downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how much information geographic INRs contain and where it is concentrated, as current methods lack such insights despite their common use in Earth observation.

Method: Analyzes the intrinsic dimension of INRs (ambient dimension 256-512) to measure local variability, examining sensitivity to spatial resolution and input modalities during pre-training.

Result: Intrinsic dimensions fall between 2 and 10, correlate with downstream task performance, and capture spatial artifacts, aiding model evaluation.

Conclusion: The intrinsic dimension serves as a label-free metric for unsupervised INR evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design.

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

*Xinyuan Song,Jiaye Teng,Ziye Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explores how robust loss functions improve optimization robustness and landscape in non-convex problems, outperforming MSE in non-Gaussian noise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MSE loss can be unreliable for non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise, prompting the need for a robust alternative.

Method: Uses a kernel-based nonparametric regression to estimate residual density and maximize log-likelihood, aligning with MSE under Gaussian noise but stable in general settings. Analyzes RIP constants.

Result: The robust loss handles large noise effectively and remains stable across diverse noise distributions.

Conclusion: Changing the loss function can enhance robustness in machine learning, supported by a broadly applicable analytical framework.

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

*Xuheng Li,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGTSVA is a variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward functions, achieving optimal regret bounds by extending the decoupling coefficient technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current variance-dependent regret bounds focus on UCB-based bandit algorithms, leaving sampling-based methods like Thompson sampling understudied. FGTSVA addresses this gap for general reward functions.

Method: FGTSVA extends the decoupling coefficient technique from Feel-good Thompson sampling (FGTS) to analyze model complexity, achieving regret bounds with respect to noise variance and model space size.

Result: FGTSVA achieves an optimal regret bound of $	ilde{O}(	ext{square root terms})$, matching UCB-based algorithms in linear settings.

Conclusion: FGTSVA advances sampling-based bandit algorithms by providing variance-aware regret bounds for general reward functions, filling a critical gap in the literature.

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Motivation: Early detection of cardiac disease requires timely identification of abnormal physiological patterns, motivating the development of an efficient diagnostic method.

Method: The approach transforms 1D phonocardiogram signals into 2D images using wavelet feature extraction and adaptive threshold compression, then processes them with a quantum-classical CNN.

Result: Preliminary results show 93.33% test set and 97.14% train set classification accuracy, indicating effective capture of temporal-spectral correlations.

Conclusion: This is the first QCNN application for bioacoustic signals, paving the way for quantum-enhanced diagnostics in healthcare.

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

TL;DR: CausalDDS, a novel framework, predicts drug synergy by identifying and utilizing causal substructures in drug molecules, improving accuracy and interpretability over black-box methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drug synergy prediction methods rely on statistical correlations and lack interpretability. CausalDDS aims to address this by focusing on causal substructures.

Method: CausalDDS disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious substructures, uses causal representations for synergy prediction, and employs conditional interventions and optimization objectives based on sufficiency and independence.

Result: CausalDDS outperforms baseline models, especially in cold start and out-of-distribution scenarios, and identifies key substructures underlying drug synergy.

Conclusion: CausalDDS is a promising tool for drug synergy prediction and discovery, offering both improved performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain method to measure distribution shift in ML models, offering an alternative to traditional statistical techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models often underperform in real-world deployments due to distribution shifts, especially in high-risk applications, prompting the need for robust measurement methods.

Method: The study proposes using Characteristic Function (CF) in the frequency domain to quantify distribution shifts, particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and domain adaptation.

Result: CF is shown to be a powerful tool for measuring distribution shifts, providing an alternative to traditional statistical techniques like Kullback-Leibler or Wasserstein distance.

Conclusion: The CF approach offers a promising solution for addressing distribution shifts in ML models, enhancing their reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High accuracy and interpretability are crucial in domains like industry and medicine due to significant decision-making consequences.

Result: Achieves best performance among ante-hoc explainable methods and competes with non-explainable/post-hoc approaches.

Conclusion: ProtoTSNet effectively balances accuracy and interpretability for domain experts.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such
fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

*Yuzhuang Pian,Taiyu Wang,Shiqi Zhang,Rui Xu,Yonghong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CGLUBNF, an end-to-end framework using Bayesian neural fields and channel gated learning units for accurate air quality forecasting despite incomplete data. It outperforms baselines in prediction accuracy and confidence calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate air quality forecasts are critical for public health and emissions control, but missing data hampers reliable inference. The study aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework combines Fourier features, graph attention encoders, and channel gated learning units with Bayesian inference to handle missing data and capture spatiotemporal dependencies.

Result: CGLUBNF outperforms five baselines in accuracy and confidence interval sharpness across four missing data patterns and various prediction horizons.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust foundation for deep learning-based spatiotemporal forecasting with incomplete data, applicable to emerging sensing paradigms like mobile monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines LLMs' performance in subtraction, revealing they lag behind addition, especially when handling negative results. Techniques like few-shot learning and instruction-tuning show promise for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtraction is a non-commutative operation that has been overlooked in LLM benchmarks, unlike addition and multiplication.

Method: Evaluated eight pretrained LLMs from four families on subtraction and addition problems, analyzing errors and testing techniques like few-shot learning and instruction-tuning.

Result: LLMs struggle with subtraction, particularly when results are negative (a<b). Few-shot learning helps modestly, but instruction-tuning achieves near-perfect accuracy.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' limitations in subtraction and demonstrates recoverability through advanced techniques like instruction-tuning.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

*Kevin Valencia,Thilina Balasooriya,Xihaier Luo,Shinjae Yoo,David Keetae Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniField is a neural framework for multimodal spatiotemporal learning, handling sparse, noisy data and varying modalities by iteratively fusing cross-modal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal data faces challenges like sparsity, noise, and varying modality availability, limiting usability without adaptive models.

Method: OmniField uses a neural field conditioned on available modalities and a crosstalk block to align signals before decoding, enabling tasks like interpolation and forecasting.

Result: OmniField outperforms eight baselines in reconstruction and prediction tasks, showing robustness even under heavy sensor noise.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses multimodal spatiotemporal learning challenges, offering unified solutions for real-world data.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

### [164] [Learning Interactive World Model for Object-Centric Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02225)
*Fan Feng,Phillip Lippe,Sara Magliacane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIOC-WM is a framework that learns structured representations of objects and their interactions in a world model, improving policy learning efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most object-centric RL methods focus on individual objects while neglecting explicit interaction modeling. FIOC-WM addresses this gap to enhance robustness and transferability of learned policies.

Method: FIOC-WM learns object-centric latents and interaction structures from pixels using pre-trained vision encoders. It decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives and trains a hierarchical policy (high-level for selecting interactions, low-level for execution).

Result: FIOC-WM outperforms baselines in sample efficiency and generalization on robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks, demonstrating the value of modular interaction learning.

Conclusion: Explicit and modular interaction learning is essential for robust control, as shown by FIOC-WM's superior performance over traditional world-model approaches.

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

### [165] [Opportunistic Expert Activation: Batch-Aware Expert Routing for Faster Decode Without Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02237)
*Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Qingyang Wu,Wai Tong Chung,Robert Wu,Bryan Gopal,Junxiong Wang,Tri Dao,Ben Athiwaratkun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic routing framework for MoE architectures to reduce decode latency by minimizing activated experts while maintaining model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models often face memory-bound issues during autoregressive generation, where latency is dictated by the number of activated experts. This paper aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: The proposed framework dynamically re-routes token-to-expert mappings using batch-aware routing, leveraging experts already loaded in memory for other tokens in the batch.

Result: On Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with a batch size of 16, the method reduces MoE layer decode latency by 39% and 15%, respectively, without significant accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The dynamic routing approach effectively lowers latency in MoE models without compromising performance, offering a practical solution for autoregressive generation.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

*Hikaru Homma,Jun Ohkubo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a neural network initialization framework incorporating spectral bias to improve training performance, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural network learning by leveraging spectral bias in initialization, avoiding reliance on backpropagation.

Method: Adjusts scale factors in the SWIM algorithm to prioritize low-frequency components early and high-frequency components later in training.

Result: Outperforms traditional initialization methods in 1D regression and MNIST tasks.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of spectral properties in initialization for better neural network performance.

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

TL;DR: A probabilistic framework for differentiable graph cuts is introduced, unifying various cuts like Normalized Cut, with tight bounds and stable gradients for scalable learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in prior probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts by providing general guarantees and principled gradients, enabling broader applicability in clustering and contrastive learning.

Method: Develops a unified probabilistic framework leveraging integral representations and Gauss hypergeometric functions to derive tight analytic bounds on expected cuts, ensuring numerical stability.

Result: The framework offers closed-form forward and backward computations, supporting scalable and differentiable graph partitioning for diverse learning objectives.

Conclusion: The proposed method establishes a rigorous foundation for differentiable graph cuts, enhancing flexibility and stability in clustering and contrastive learning tasks.

Abstract: Probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts offer a differentiable alternative to
spectral clustering, enabling end-to-end and online learning without
eigendecompositions, yet prior work centered on RatioCut and lacked general
guarantees and principled gradients. We present a unified probabilistic
framework that covers a wide class of cuts, including Normalized Cut. Our
framework provides tight analytic upper bounds on expected discrete cuts via
integral representations and Gauss hypergeometric functions with closed-form
forward and backward. Together, these results deliver a rigorous, numerically
stable foundation for scalable, differentiable graph partitioning covering a
wide range of clustering and contrastive learning objectives.

*Yuheng Zhao,Yu-Hu Yan,Kfir Yehuda Levy,Peng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between gradient-variation online learning and offline optimization, focusing on Hölder smooth functions. It introduces adaptive algorithms for online learning and applies them to optimize stochastic convex problems universally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between gradient-variation online learning and offline optimization, especially for Hölder smooth functions, and to develop adaptive algorithms that do not require prior knowledge of smoothness parameters.

Method: Developed gradient-variation online learning algorithms for (strongly) convex Hölder smooth functions and applied online-to-batch conversion for stochastic convex optimization. Also integrated online adaptivity with a detection-based procedure for offline optimization.

Result: The algorithms smoothly interpolate between smooth and non-smooth regimes without prior knowledge of Hölder parameters, achieving optimal universal performance for stochastic convex optimization and accelerated convergence in offline optimization.

Conclusion: The study successfully connects online learning and offline optimization under Hölder smoothness, offering adaptive and universal methods that perform optimally across different regimes.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

### [169] [Reinforcement learning based data assimilation for unknown state model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02286)
*Ziyi Wang,Lijian Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning and ensemble-based Bayesian filtering method to learn surrogate state transition models directly from noisy observations, avoiding reliance on noise-free training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning approaches for data assimilation require noise-free ground-truth state sequences, which are often impractical to obtain.

Method: The method integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian filtering, treating parameter estimation as a Markov decision process solved via RL.

Result: Numerical examples show the method achieves high accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical solution for learning surrogate models in data assimilation without needing true state trajectories.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) for privacy-preserving anomaly detection in IIoT, leveraging quantum feature maps and federated aggregation to improve scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in anomaly detection for high-dimensional IIoT systems, including privacy, scalability, and handling non-linear decision boundaries.

Method: FQKL integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation, using quantum circuits to compute compressed kernel statistics locally and sharing summaries for global model training.

Result: FQKL outperforms classical federated baselines in capturing temporal correlations and reduces communication overhead.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of quantum kernels in federated settings, paving the way for scalable and quantum-enhanced IoT intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

*Fengjuan Wang,Zhiyi Su,Xingzhu Hu,Cheng Wang,Mou Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FP8-Flow-MoE introduces an efficient FP8 training recipe for large Mixture-of-Experts models, reducing compute and memory demands while maintaining stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FP8 implementations suffer from redundant quantize-dequantize conversions and double quantization errors, limiting efficiency.

Method: Proposes quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with scaling-aware transpose and fused FP8 operators to eliminate redundant casts.

Result: Achieves 21% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU while maintaining stable convergence.

Conclusion: FP8-Flow-MoE provides a plug-and-play solution compatible with existing frameworks, promising significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

### [172] [The Sequential Edge: Inverse-Entropy Voting Beats Parallel Self-Consistency at Matched Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02309)
*Aman Sharma,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether parallel or sequential scaling is more effective for language model reasoning, finding sequential refinement outperforms parallel approaches in most cases. It introduces inverse-entropy weighted voting to further enhance sequential scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine the most effective test-time scaling strategy (parallel vs. sequential) for language model reasoning under equal token and compute constraints.

Method: The authors evaluate 5 state-of-the-art models and 3 reasoning benchmarks, comparing parallel chains (self-consistency decoding) with sequential refinement. They also introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting for accuracy improvement.

Result: Sequential scaling outperforms parallel scaling in 95.6% of cases, with accuracy gains up to 46.7%. Inverse-entropy weighted voting further boosts sequential scaling's success rate.

Conclusion: Sequential refinement is superior to parallel scaling for LLM reasoning, challenging the dominant paradigm and advocating for a shift in inference-time optimization strategies.

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

### [173] [Large-scale automatic carbon ion treatment planning for head and neck cancers via parallel multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02314)
*Jueye Zhang,Chao Yang,Youfang Lai,Kai-Wen Li,Wenting Yan,Yunzhou Xia,Haimei Zhang,Jingjing Zhou,Gen Yang,Chen Lin,Tian Li,Yibao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to optimize 45 treatment-planning parameters (TPPs) in intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) for head-and-neck cancer. The method outperforms manual tuning, improving OAR sparing and plan quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head-and-neck cancer treatment planning is challenging due to the proximity of critical organs-at-risk (OARs) to complex targets. Current deep learning and reinforcement learning methods for IMCT planning face limitations like data bias, plan feasibility issues, and inefficient exploration of large parameter spaces.

Method: The authors introduce a MARL framework with a CTDE QMIX backbone, incorporating Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and DRQN for stable learning. Techniques like compact DVH state inputs, linear action-to-value mapping, and a clinically informed reward function enhance efficiency. A multi-process system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization.

Result: The method tuned 45 TPPs simultaneously, producing plans comparable or superior to expert manual tuning (RL score: 85.93% vs Manual: 85.02%). It significantly improved OAR sparing for five organs (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: The MARL framework efficiently explores high-dimensional TPP spaces, generates clinically competitive IMCT plans, and improves OAR sparing through direct TPS interaction, addressing key challenges in IMCT planning.

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

TL;DR: RoME is a domain-robust framework using Mixture-of-Experts to predict MILP solutions across domains, improving generalization and performance through robust optimization and cross-domain training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based MILP solvers struggle with generalization across unseen problem domains, limiting scalability and practicality.

Method: RoME employs a Mixture-of-Experts framework with dynamic routing and two-level distributionally robust optimization (inter-domain and intra-domain).

Result: RoME achieves a 67.7% average improvement across five domains and performs well in zero-shot settings on MIPLIB.

Conclusion: Cross-domain training enhances generalization and performance, enabling scalable learning-based MILP solvers.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

TL;DR: HYSTL is a hypernetwork-enhanced framework for crime prediction that dynamically generates predictor parameters based on crime type, leveraging a knowledge graph to bridge semantic gaps across cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crime prediction methods struggle with aligning knowledge across diverse cities due to varying crime type data availability.

Method: HYSTL uses a hypernetwork to dynamically generate predictor parameters conditioned on crime types, aided by a structured crime knowledge graph.

Result: HYSTL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in experiments on cities with non-overlapping crime types.

Conclusion: HYSTL effectively unifies crime prediction across cities with diverse data by leveraging hypernetworks and crime knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

### [176] [Reducing normalizing flow complexity for MCMC preconditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02345)
*David Nabergoj,Erik Štrumbelj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a factorized preconditioning architecture combining linear and conditional normalizing flows (NFs) to improve MCMC sampling efficiency and adaptability to target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nonlinear preconditioners using overparameterized NFs can degrade sampling efficiency and fit quality, and they lack adaptability to target distributions. The study aims to address these limitations.

Method: A factorized preconditioning architecture is introduced, using a linear preconditioner for approximately Gaussian dimensions and a conditional NF for complex dimensions, estimated from warmup samples.

Result: The method improves tail sampling on synthetic distributions, performs better on sparse logistic regression posteriors, and achieves higher effective sample sizes on hierarchical Bayesian models with weak likelihoods and strong funnel geometries.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances MCMC sampling efficiency and adaptability, making it particularly useful for hierarchical Bayesian models with limited data and contributing to advancements in neural MCMC design.

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian

*Qingyun Sun,Jiayi Luo,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Hao Peng,Jianxin Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes EvoOOD, a framework for out-of-distribution generalization in dynamic graphs using environment-aware invariant pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs struggle with generalization under distribution shifts in dynamic graphs, necessitating a focus on environment evolution's impact.

Method: EvoOOD includes an environment sequential variational auto-encoder, environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, and fine-grained causal interventions on nodes.

Result: Experiments show EvoOOD's superiority on dynamic datasets under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: EvoOOD is pioneering in addressing dynamic graph OOD generalization from an environment evolution perspective.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUMA-RAG introduces innovations to address challenges in continuous multimodal data streams for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, improving freshness and cross-modal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of maintaining index freshness and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency in dynamic multimodal streams.

Method: LUMA-RAG uses a multi-tier memory system, alignment bridge for cross-modal consistency, and stability-aware retrieval telemetry.

Result: Achieves robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94) and stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0).

Conclusion: LUMA-RAG is a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for
grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as
modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

*Rohith Shinoj Kumar,Rushdeep Dinda,Aditya Tyagi,Annappa B.,Naveen Kumar M. R*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture is proposed for robust arrhythmia detection, achieving high accuracy and F1 scores on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of arrhythmia is crucial for preventing complications, but manual diagnosis is subjective. Deep learning offers automation but struggles with generalization in noisy data.

Method: The paper introduces a CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture, incorporating H-Infinity filter principles for robustness, applied to heart sound recordings.

Result: The model achieves 99.42% accuracy and 98.85% F1 score on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enhances generalization and accuracy, making it promising for real-world arrhythmia detection.

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown environments using Gaussian Processes, balancing exploration and exploitation with local cost functions and GP-UCB-inspired terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coverage control in unknown spatial environments without centralized coordination, leveraging decentralized decision-making and local communication.

Method: Agents autonomously minimize a local cost function combining expected locational cost and variance-based exploration, inspired by GP-UCB. They update inducing points with a greedy strategy for scalable online GP updates.

Result: The algorithm effectively balances exploration and exploitation, guiding agents to regions of high predicted density and uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized algorithm demonstrates scalability and efficiency in simulation, outperforming previous work by relying only on local interactions.

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

*Virgile Dine,Teddy Furon,Charly Faure*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formulates machine unlearning as a constrained optimization problem, introducing feasible updates to retain model utility while unlearning, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently unlearning data from machine learning models without degrading their utility.

Method: Proposes feasible updates based on parameter masking and statistical guarantees for gradient noise, compatible with first-order unlearning methods.

Result: Experiments with computer vision classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The technique offers a practical solution for machine unlearning, maintaining model performance while enabling data removal.

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

*Thomas Sanchez,Pedro M. Gordaliza,Meritxell Bach Cuadra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the issue of false performance claims in machine learning for medical imaging due to underspecification, proposing a statistical framework to account for it and showing that even minor variations in training can require stronger evidence for superiority claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of statistical robustness in performance gains reported in machine learning for medical imaging, particularly by incorporating underspecification into the analysis.

Method: Extended a recent statistical framework to include underspecification as a variance component, using simulations to evaluate the impact of seed variability.

Result: Simulations showed that even minor seed variability (~1%) increases the evidence needed to substantiate superiority claims.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of explicitly modeling training variance in validating medical imaging systems to avoid false outperformance claims.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

*Xuan-Truong Quan,Xuan-Son Quan,Duc Do Minh,Vinh Nguyen Van*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE) outperforms Euclidean models by constraining entity representations to a hypersphere, leveraging spherical geometry for robust and semantically coherent learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean space models like TransE have inherent limitations in modeling complex relations and inefficient training. SKGE aims to address these issues by using spherical geometry.

Method: SKGE maps entities onto a hypersphere using a learnable Spherization Layer and interprets relations as a hybrid translate-then-project transformation.

Result: SKGE consistently outperforms TransE on benchmarks (FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, CoDEx-M), with the spherical geometric prior acting as a powerful regularizer and creating inherently hard negative sampling.

Conclusion: The choice of manifold is a fundamental design principle, advocating for geometric priors to enhance the next generation of KGE models.

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOWS combines neural operators with classical iterative solvers to accelerate PDE simulations, reducing computational time by up to 90% while maintaining stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity PDE simulations are computationally expensive, and data-driven surrogates often lack reliability outside their training distribution. NOWS bridges this gap.

Method: NOWS uses learned solution operators to produce high-quality initial guesses for Krylov methods like conjugate gradient and GMRES, integrating with existing numerical methods.

Result: Benchmarks show NOWS reduces iteration counts and runtime by up to 90%, preserving the guarantees of traditional solvers.

Conclusion: NOWS offers a practical, reliable way to speed up PDE simulations by combining neural operators with classical numerical methods.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate
high-fidelity PDE simulations.

*Rajan Das Gupta,Md Kishor Morol,Nafiz Fahad,Md Tanzib Hosain,Sumaya Binte Zilani Choya,Md Jakir Hossen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel system called BRAINS uses LLMs to detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease, combining cognitive diagnosis with case retrieval for improved accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing global burden of Alzheimer's disease necessitates early and accurate detection, especially in regions with limited diagnostic tools.

Method: BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module fine-tuned on neuroimaging data and a case-retrieval module that enhances understanding by retrieving similar cases.

Result: Evaluations show BRAINS effectively classifies disease severity and detects early cognitive decline, proving its potential as a scalable tool.

Conclusion: BRAINS offers a promising, explainable solution for early Alzheimer's detection and has potential for broader applications in the field.

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework combining informativeness and geometric simplicity in learning, proposing V-GIB for mutual-information compression and curvature regularization, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize learning representations as a balance between informativeness and geometric simplicity, linking geometry to sample efficiency.

Method: Proposes Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck (V-GIB), using curvature and intrinsic dimensionality penalties, with tractable geometric proxies.

Result: Demonstrates robust Pareto frontiers, stable estimators, and improved efficiency, especially under data scarcity.

Conclusion: V-GIB offers a principled approach to geometrically coherent, data-efficient representations aligned with human-understandable structure.

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

*Changhao Miao,Yuntian Zhang,Tongyu Wu,Fang Deng,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DRLHQ, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning method with heterogeneous querying attention, to solve CLRPs and OCLRPs, showcasing superior performance over traditional and DRL-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLRPs are complex due to intertwined location and routing decisions, and existing DRL methods haven't fully explored this. The paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: Introduces DRLHQ, an encoder-decoder model tailored to CLRPs, using a Markov decision process framework and a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism.

Result: Outperforms traditional and DRL-based methods in solution quality and generalization on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DRLHQ effectively addresses CLRPs and OCLRPs, offering a scalable and adaptable framework for similar problems.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Healthcare AI often fails due to reliance on statistical associations over causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks (GNNs) address this by learning invariant mechanisms, improving performance, fairness, and interpretability. The review covers methods and applications, proposing frameworks for causal validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness of AI in healthcare caused by learning spurious correlations instead of causal mechanisms, leading to performance drops and discrimination.

Method: Combines graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles (structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, interventional prediction, counterfactual reasoning).

Result: Demonstrates clinical value in psychiatric diagnosis, cancer subtyping, physiological monitoring, and drug recommendation. Proposes Causal Digital Twins for patient-specific experimentation.

Conclusion: While promising, challenges include computational demands, validation, and risks of 'causal-washing.' Frameworks are needed to distinguish causally-inspired methods from validated discoveries.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies a many-to-one matching problem (e.g., college admissions) with non-linear utility functions for diversity, showing classical stable matchings may not exist. It proposes Rawlsian fairness-based solutions and practical algorithms for fair allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical stable matching models in scenarios where colleges evaluate sets of students based on non-linear utility functions capturing diversity.

Method: Proposes alternative solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness and designs deterministic and stochastic algorithms to iteratively improve outcomes for the worst-off college.

Result: Demonstrates that classical stable matchings may not exist in this setting and provides practical algorithms to achieve fair allocation when stability is unattainable.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel approach to ensuring fairness in many-to-one matching problems with diversity considerations, even when traditional stability is impossible.

Abstract: We study a many-to-one matching problem, such as the college admission
problem, where each college can admit multiple students. Unlike classical
models, colleges evaluate sets of students through non-linear utility functions
that capture diversity between them. In this setting, we show that classical
stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative
solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum
utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

*Mathieu Chevalley,Arash Mehrjou,Patrick Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) in causal discovery under specific conditions, showing concentration around its mean and vanishing error in large-scale settings, especially for scale-free graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the false-negative rate in causal structure recovery under interventions, addressing challenges posed by high dimensionality and latent confounding.

Method: Theoretical analysis of FNR under single-variable random interventions and an ϵ-interventional faithfulness assumption, examining sparse Erdős–Rényi and scale-free Barabási–Albert graphs.

Result: FNR concentrates around its mean with rate O(log d/√d) for Erdős–Rényi graphs and vanishes for scale-free graphs with degree exponent γ > 3.

Conclusion: Realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error, challenging the intuition that high dimensionality hinders accurate recovery.

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

### [192] [Adaptive Neighborhood-Constrained Q Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02567)
*Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline RL faces OOD action issues. Existing constraints (density, support, sample) have flaws. A new neighborhood constraint is proposed to address these, offering flexibility and better performance. ANQ, an algorithm using this constraint, excels in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address extrapolation errors from OOD actions in offline RL, which existing constraint methods (density, support, sample) fail to fully resolve due to their inherent limitations.

Method: Introduces a neighborhood constraint, restricts action selection to neighborhoods of dataset actions, and uses an adaptive approach based on data quality. ANQ, a bilevel optimization-based algorithm, implements this constraint.

Result: Theoretically bounds errors and distribution shift; empirically, ANQ outperforms others on benchmarks and handles noisy/limited data well.

Conclusion: The neighborhood constraint overcomes limitations of traditional constraints, and ANQ demonstrates superior performance and robustness in offline RL.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

### [193] [Dynamic Priors in Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02570)
*Lukas Fehring,Marcel Wever,Maximilian Spliethöver,Leona Hennig,Henning Wachsmuth,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method is introduced to allow users to steer Bayesian optimization (BO) for hyperparameter tuning via repeated interventions, leveraging expert knowledge and detecting misleading inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPO is effective but often lacks acceptance due to its black-box nature and limited user control. Existing methods initialize BO with expert knowledge but don't allow online steering.

Method: The paper generalizes $π$BO to enable repeated interventions for steering BO via user input, using prior distributions. It introduces a misleading prior detection scheme to protect against harmful inputs.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows the method effectively incorporates informative priors, rejects misleading ones, and remains competitive with unperturbed BO.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances BO for HPO by integrating user control while maintaining robustness against unreliable inputs.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

### [194] [Directional-Clamp PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02577)
*Gilad Karpel,Ruida Zhou,Shoham Sabach,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DClamp-PPO, a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which penalizes actions moving in the 'wrong' direction during policy updates, improving performance over standard PPO and its variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observed that PPO's performance is hindered by actions frequently moving in the 'wrong' direction during optimization, a factor previously overlooked. They aim to address this by penalizing such actions.

Method: The proposed DClamp-PPO algorithm penalizes actions in 'wrong' direction regions by enforcing a steeper loss slope (clamp) when the importance ratio deviates significantly from 1, controlled by a tunable parameter β.

Result: DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms standard PPO and its variants across various MuJoCo environments, theoretically and empirically avoiding 'wrong' direction updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of addressing 'wrong' direction updates in PPO and demonstrates the effectiveness of DClamp-PPO in improving policy optimization.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate
credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine

### [196] [Neural Network Interoperability Across Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02610)
*Nadia Daoudi,Ivan Alfonso,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an automated method for migrating neural network code across deep learning frameworks using a pivot model, validated with PyTorch and TensorFlow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of tailored migration approaches for NNs leads to increased manual effort when switching frameworks due to performance, requirements, or feature updates.

Method: Uses a pivot NN model to abstract the NN before migration, addressing challenges specific to PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Result: Successfully migrates five NNs, producing functionally equivalent implementations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively automates NN code migration, reducing manual effort and ensuring compatibility with new frameworks.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAIGNs improve upon IGNs by combining reconstruction with a non-adversarial generative objective, addressing mode collapse and training instability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IGNs suffer from mode collapse and training instability due to adversarial objectives, limiting their effectiveness as data manifold projectors and generators.

Method: NAIGNs use a loss function combining reconstruction with the non-adversarial IMLE objective, avoiding adversarial training.

Result: NAIGNs enhance corrupted data restoration and generate samples that better match the data distribution, while also learning the distance field and an energy-based model.

Conclusion: NAIGNs offer a more stable and effective alternative to IGNs for generative modeling and manifold projection.

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also
function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto
the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

*David Kattermann,Lothar Sebastian Krapp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores CPAC learning, where learners must be computable, and reveals that traditional VC-dimension conditions don't apply. It introduces effective VC-dimensions and links them to RER classes, showing varied dimensions and characterizing learnability through RER class containment. Agnostic learnability is also addressed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand CPAC learning under computability constraints and reconcile it with traditional PAC learning frameworks by introducing effective dimensions and exploring RER classes.

Method: Analyzes CPAC learning by introducing effective VC-dimensions, studying RER classes, and connecting dimensions to learnability conditions. Uses algorithmic and theoretical approaches.

Result: Effective VC-dimensions can exceed traditional ones, even for RER classes. CPAC learnability is characterized via RER class containment, and agnostic learnability is achievable for RER classes under relaxed CPAC learning.

Conclusion: CPAC learning under computability constraints requires rethinking traditional dimensions, with RER classes playing a key role in characterizing learnability and enabling agnostic learning.

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

### [199] [Natural-gas storage modelling by deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02646)
*Tiziano Balaconi,Aldo Glielmo,Marco Taboga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GasRL is a simulator combining natural gas market modeling with RL-trained storage policies, showing SAC's superior performance in achieving profitability, market stability, and price realism without explicit calibration. It also evaluates EU-mandated storage thresholds, highlighting their benefits for market resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to analyze how optimal gas storage management, trained via RL, impacts market equilibrium, prices, and supply-demand dynamics, while also exploring the effects of regulatory policies like EU storage thresholds.

Method: GasRL integrates a calibrated natural gas market model with RL-trained storage-operator policies. It tests various RL algorithms, identifying SAC as the best performer, and evaluates policy impacts on price dynamics and market resilience.

Result: SAC achieves multiple storage-operator objectives (profitability, market clearing, price stabilization) and produces price dynamics matching real-world patterns. EU-mandated storage thresholds enhance market resilience against supply shocks.

Conclusion: GasRL demonstrates RL's potential for optimizing gas storage management, with SAC proving effective. Regulatory measures like storage thresholds can improve market stability under unexpected supply disruptions.

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of training shared models collaboratively in federated learning despite Byzantine adversaries causing arbitrary malicious behaviors.

Method: Integrates Nesterov's momentum with Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to safeguard against gradient corruption and enhance convergence speed.

Result: Finite-time convergence guarantee under non-convex and smooth loss functions; outperforms benchmarks in speed, accuracy, and resilience to attacks.

Conclusion: Byrd-NAFL is effective and superior to existing methods in federated learning robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

TL;DR: A novel in situ training protocol using implicit neural representations prevents catastrophic forgetting by leveraging sketched data as a regularizer, achieving strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, particularly for in situ neural compression using implicit neural representation-based hypernetworks.

Method: Uses limited memory buffers of full and sketched data samples, with sketching serving as a regularizer motivated by Johnson-Lindenstrauss theory.

Result: Demonstrates strong reconstruction performance on complex simulation data in 2D/3D over long time horizons, matching offline method performance.

Conclusion: Sketching enables effective in situ training with performance comparable to offline methods.

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

TL;DR: The paper addresses compositional generalization in machine learning by introducing a rigorous evaluation framework, an extensive study on vision backbones, and a new model class that improves accuracy and reduces parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and limitations in current benchmarks for compositional generalization, while addressing the inefficiencies in general-purpose vision architectures.

Method: The paper proposes: 1) a unified evaluation framework with reduced computational costs, 2) a large-scale evaluation of supervised vision backbones, and 3) Attribute Invariant Networks for better generalization.

Result: The Attribute Invariant Networks achieve a 23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines and reduce parameter overhead from 600% to 16%.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a new model class and framework that significantly advances compositional generalization in machine learning.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead
from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training to help agents adapt to complex deployment requirements. Validated in RL and LLM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training agents under strict constraints is challenging; a gradual approach can ease the transition to complex environments.

Method: Curriculum learning strategy starting with simplified constraints and progressively introducing full deployment conditions.

Result: Accelerated training and improved performance in RL and LLM tasks, including inference speedup for LLMs.

Conclusion: Curriculum design enhances agent efficiency and performance under complex constraints, applicable to diverse settings.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

### [204] [Does Interpretability of Knowledge Tracing Models Support Teacher Decision Making?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02718)
*Adia Khalid,Alina Deriyeva,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines whether interpretable knowledge tracing (KT) models aid human teachers in making pedagogical decisions, finding mixed results: while teachers prefer interpretable models, these do not significantly reduce the tasks needed for mastery, indicating a complex relationship between model interpretability and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine if interpretable KT models, which provide explicit insights into learners' abilities, actually assist teachers in making better pedagogical decisions compared to non-interpretable models.

Method: The study first uses simulations to compare interpretable and non-interpretable KT models, then involves 12 human teachers to evaluate usability, trustworthiness, and decision-making effectiveness based on these models.

Result: Teachers rated interpretable KT models higher in usability and trustworthiness, but the number of tasks required for learner mastery did not significantly differ between model types.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that interpretability alone does not straightforwardly improve teaching decisions, suggesting further research is needed to understand how teachers and learners interact with KT models.

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

TL;DR: Calibrating the base model in mislabeled data detection improves accuracy and robustness, offering a practical solution for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mislabeled data harms machine learning performance, and detecting such errors is crucial for reliable model outcomes.

Method: Training a base model to generate trust scores for labels, with a focus on the impact of calibrating this model.

Result: Empirical evidence shows calibration enhances detection accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Calibration is a practical and effective method for improving mislabeled data detection in industrial settings.

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConMeZO accelerates zeroth-order optimization for LLMs by adaptive directional sampling, achieving faster convergence without increasing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) with zeroth-order optimization avoids backpropagation's memory overhead but suffers from slow convergence due to high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Method: ConMeZO improves speed by sampling directions adaptively within a cone centered around a momentum estimate, reducing the impact of dimensionality.

Result: ConMeZO matches MeZO's theoretical convergence rate and empirically speeds up finetuning by up to 2X on natural language tasks.

Conclusion: ConMeZO offers a memory-efficient and faster alternative to MeZO for zeroth-order optimization in LLM finetuning.

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VecComp extends the ChannelComp framework to enable efficient and robust vector function computation over noisy and fading channels using multiple-antenna technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of ChannelComp, which is restricted to scalar functions and susceptible to channel fading, and to support high-dimensional, data-centric applications.

Method: VecComp integrates ChannelComp with multiple-antenna technology, ensuring scalable computational complexity that grows linearly with vector dimension.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm VecComp's effectiveness in improving vector function computation and fading compensation. A non-asymptotic error bound validates its efficiency.

Conclusion: VecComp is a scalable and robust solution for high-dimensional computations in noisy and fading channels, making it suitable for advanced data-centric applications.

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Result: Matches or exceeds baselines on GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, with smooth latent-space representations. On Tartarus benchmarks, it improves docking-score distributions for better binding predictions.

Conclusion: A modernized VAE with principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning remains competitive for molecular generation tasks.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

### [209] [Adam Reduces a Unique Form of Sharpness: Theoretical Insights Near the Minimizer Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02773)
*Xinghan Li,Haodong Wen,Kaifeng Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that Adam optimizer reduces a unique sharpness measure, differing from SGD, and achieves better sparsity and generalization in certain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Adam's solutions differ from SGD and its implicit sharpness reduction behavior.

Method: Analyzes Adam's behavior through continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations.

Result: Adam minimizes a different sharpness measure (tr(Diag(H)^(1/2))) compared to SGD (tr(H)), leading to better sparsity and generalization.

Conclusion: The framework extends to other adaptive methods, offering insights for future optimizer design.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

### [210] [Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02785)
*Andras Ferenczi,Sutapa Samanta,Dagen Wang,Todd Hodges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a QUBO-based method to reduce privacy exposure in federated learning by selecting a small subset of client updates per round, achieving significant privacy improvements while maintaining model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing risk of sensitive data exposure in federated learning due to cumulative client updates, which makes the system vulnerable to membership, property inference, and model inversion attacks.

Method: A quantum computing-inspired QUBO formulation is used to select a minimal subset of client updates per training round, focusing on the most relevant updates to mitigate privacy risks.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and CINIC-10 datasets showed substantial reductions in privacy exposure (95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative for MNIST; 82% per-round and 33% cumulative for CINIC-10) while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: The QUBO-based method effectively reduces privacy risks in federated learning by limiting client exposure, even in more complex or larger-scale scenarios, without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

*Nicolas Riccieri Gardin Assumpcao,Leandro Villas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPP is a secure and private federated learning approach that protects against attacks while maintaining data privacy, achieving fast convergence even with malicious participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods prioritize data privacy but struggle to defend against attacks that compromise training outcomes. FPP addresses this gap by ensuring security and privacy simultaneously.

Method: FPP employs secure aggregation, participant assessments, and a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate attackers. It allows training recovery post-attack and validates performance in a dockerized environment.

Result: FPP outperforms other methods (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice, Trimmed Mean, Median) by achieving rapid convergence and functioning effectively despite model poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: FPP successfully balances privacy and security in federated learning, demonstrating resilience against attacks and efficient convergence in adversarial settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabTune is a unified library standardizing workflows for tabular foundation models, addressing adoption barriers like inconsistent APIs, preprocessing, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of heterogeneous preprocessing, fragmented APIs, and inconsistent fine-tuning in tabular foundation models, hindering their adoption.

Method: TabTune provides a single interface for seven state-of-the-art models, supporting zero-shot inference, meta-learning, SFT, and PEFT, with automated preprocessing and evaluation.

Result: TabTune standardizes workflows, automates preprocessing, and integrates performance, calibration, and fairness evaluation, enhancing reproducibility and benchmarking.

Conclusion: TabTune bridges gaps in tabular foundation model adoption, offering a unified, extensible, and reproducible solution for consistent adaptation and evaluation.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data
learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains.
However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing
pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the
absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as
calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a
single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art
models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot
inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages
architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and
reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation
strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune .

*Morgan Allen,Paul Savala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analyzed machine learning models for predicting MLB game outcomes, linked win probabilities to score differentials, and evaluated their effectiveness in run-line betting, revealing profitable strategies and pitfalls of naive use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend existing work by comprehensively evaluating machine learning models for predicting MLB game outcomes and assessing their practical utility in betting.

Method: Trained multiple machine learning models on a common dataset, correlated win probabilities with score differentials, and tested their performance in run-line betting scenarios.

Result: Confirmed a relationship between predicted win probabilities and win strength, demonstrated positive returns with strategic betting, and highlighted losses from naive model use.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can effectively predict game outcomes and inform profitable betting strategies, but require careful implementation to avoid losses.

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in
determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building
machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced
by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so
we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

### [214] [GeoCrossBench: Cross-Band Generalization for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02831)
*Hakob Tamazyan,Ani Vanyan,Alvard Barseghyan,Anna Khosrovyan,Evan Shelhamer,Hrant Khachatrian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoCrossBench extends GeoBench to evaluate generalization of foundation models for remote sensing across satellites with varying band configurations, showing significant performance drops and proposing ChiViT for improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing remote sensing satellite diversity and the high cost of retraining foundation models, evaluating and improving their generalization to new satellites is crucial.

Method: Introduces GeoCrossBench with a focus on in-distribution performance, generalization to satellites with no band overlap, and handling additional bands. Also develops ChiViT, a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT.

Result: Top models like DOFA and TerraFM underperform general-purpose models (DINOv3) in-distribution. Performance drops 2-4x when generalizing to no-band-overlap satellites, but ChiViT outperforms others. Additional bands cause 5-25% performance decline. Fine-tuning with oracle labels shows potential.

Conclusion: Remote sensing models struggle with cross-satellite generalization, but ChiViT offers improvements. The benchmark is not yet saturated, highlighting the need for more robust future-proof models. Code and datasets are released for further development.

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

*Wenzhe Fan,Ning Yan,Masood Mortazavi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: EvoMem, a multi-agent framework with dual-evolving memory mechanisms, improves planning tasks by mimicking human-like memory coordination among agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the unexplored role of human-like memory in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks for natural language planning, emphasizing iterative reasoning and error correction.

Method: EvoMem introduces three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, Actor) and two memory modules (Constraint Memory and Query-feedback Memory) that evolve across and within queries to refine solutions.

Result: Evaluations on tasks like trip planning and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, proving EvoMem's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical role of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning, demonstrating EvoMem's success.

Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving
complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have
begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within
these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents
coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where
iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the
success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present
EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The
framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)
and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries
by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a
query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by
accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory
modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip
planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance
improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success
underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

*Manonmani Sekar,Nasim Nezamoddini*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A novel traffic signal control framework using GAT and SAC RL improves coordination between HDVs and CAVs, reducing delays and violations while enhancing fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coordinating HDVs and CAVs at multilane intersections for smoother traffic flow.

Method: Combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to model traffic dynamics and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL for adaptive signal control.

Result: Achieved a 24.1% reduction in average delay, 29.2% fewer violations, and improved fairness (ratio of 1.59) between HDVs and CAVs.

Conclusion: The GAT-SAC framework shows promise for real-world mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is
ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected
autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control
framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model
the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and
temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a
robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal
control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the
system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with
objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring
safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated
using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%
reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs
improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.
These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for
real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

TL;DR: ACC-MARL improves multi-agent reinforcement learning by decomposing complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks using automata, enhancing coordination and task assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-agent reinforcement learning are sample-inefficient and limited to single tasks, prompting the need for a more scalable and efficient approach.

Method: We propose ACC-MARL, a framework using automata to decompose tasks, learn decentralized policies, and optimize task assignments during execution.

Result: ACC-MARL demonstrates emergent multi-step coordination among agents and optimal task assignments, improving efficiency over existing methods.

Conclusion: The ACC-MARL framework successfully addresses the limitations of current methods by enabling scalable, task-aware coordination in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for
cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized
execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the
decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to
agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited
to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for
learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main
challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove
the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of
learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.
Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,
e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and
short-circuiting tasks.
