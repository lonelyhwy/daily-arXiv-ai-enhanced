We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D\nultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional\nCohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age.

A Majority Vote of these selection\nmethods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline\nenables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling\nscalable analysis in both clinical and research settings.

Empirically, shrinkage baselines\nconsistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to\nlower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces shrinkage estimators for improving mean reward estimation in RLVR, reducing variance in policy-gradient methods like GRPO and enhancing training stability.", "motivation": "The need for stable and efficient training of large reasoning models (LRMs) using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) motivates the search for better baselines to reduce variance in policy-gradient estimators.", "method": "The authors propose shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means, inspired by Stein's paradox, to improve mean reward estimation accuracy, especially in low-generation regimes.", "result": "Theoretically, the shrinkage-based baseline reduces variance in policy-gradient estimators.
