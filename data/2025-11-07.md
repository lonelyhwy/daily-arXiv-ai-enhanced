### [1] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for CNNs on edge devices, reducing trainable parameters by up to 100x while maintaining accuracy close to full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of domain shift in edge applications like HAR under strict memory, compute, and energy constraints.

Method: Uses Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) on pre-trained layers, selectively updates output-side cores with zero-initialization, and fuses updates back into dense kernels.

Result: Achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating ≤1.49% of parameters and speeds up convergence by 1.4-3.8x.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge enables practical, structure-aligned, parameter-efficient CNN adaptation for edge platforms.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [2] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI is an open-source tool for annotating animal behaviors and interactions in videos, bridging gaps in existing annotation tools by combining localization and interaction labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools lack the capability to annotate both behaviors and interactions in video data, limiting the study of social and individualized animal behavior.

Method: SILVI integrates behavioral labeling and localization functionalities, enabling direct annotation of interactions within videos and producing structured outputs for computer vision models.

Result: SILVI provides a solution for fine-grained behavioral analyses, linking behavioral ecology with computer vision, and can also be applied to human interaction annotation.

Conclusion: SILVI fills a critical gap in annotation tools, facilitating automated approaches for detailed behavioral studies and extending potential use cases beyond animal behavior.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [3] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DL models for COVID-19 detection from CXRs often fail on OOD data due to learning shortcuts. Injecting noise during training improves robustness, reducing the performance gap between ID and OOD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL models for COVID-19 detection lack generalization to OOD data, relying on shortcuts instead of genuine biomarkers. This study explores noise injection to enhance robustness.

Method: The study applies Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper noise during training to improve model generalization.

Result: Noise injection reduces the ID-OOD performance gap from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06 across metrics like AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, and specificity.

Conclusion: Noise injection during training effectively enhances model robustness to distribution shifts, improving generalization to OOD data.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [4] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores imitation learning for X-ray-guided spine procedures, developing a simulation sandbox and training policies for cannula alignment, achieving 68.5% success on first attempts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of multi-view X-ray interpretation in spine instrumentation and test the feasibility of imitation learning for bi-plane-guided cannula insertion.

Method: An in silico sandbox was created for realistic simulation of X-ray-guided procedures. A dataset of correct trajectories and bi-planar X-ray sequences was curated. Imitation learning policies were trained for planning and open-loop control.

Result: The policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintained safe trajectories, and generalized to complex anatomy and varied initializations. It also showed promise on real bi-planar X-rays.

Conclusion: While promising, limitations like entry point precision were noted. Future work could enhance closed-loop control with robust priors and domain knowledge, potentially aiding CT-free spinal navigation.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [5] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced real-time object detection framework using a lightweight YOLOv12 with SAT and data augmentation improves waste detection in deserts, validated by DroneTrashNet benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and hazards of traditional waste collection in remote areas like deserts, leveraging automation for organic and hazardous waste detection.

Method: Proposes a pruned, lightweight YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and specialized data augmentation strategies.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in precision, recall, and mAP, with low latency and compact model size suitable for drones.

Conclusion: Combines data-centric and model-centric enhancements for robust, real-time waste detection in challenging desert environments.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [6] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition (CoImg) to address issues like class imbalance and poor image quality in deep learning, achieving near-perfect accuracy on a modified dataset (Co-OCTDL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve deep learning model performance on imbalanced and low-quality datasets by enhancing intra-class variance and information density per training sample.

Method: Created Composite Input Images (CoImg) by fusing multiple images of the same class into combined visual composites. Evaluated using a VGG16 model on the OCTDL dataset and its balanced variant, Co-OCTDL.

Result: Achieved 99.6% accuracy, F1-score of 0.995, and AUC of 0.9996, with significantly lower false prediction rates compared to the baseline model.

Conclusion: CoImg effectively improves model performance on imbalanced or small datasets, demonstrating high-quality predictions even with challenging data.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [7] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An unsupervised framework for medical anomaly detection leverages incremental expansion of normal samples, lightweight adapters, and dual probabilistic gates to improve accuracy without labeled anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of detecting anomalies in medical imaging where labeled anomalies are scarce and expert supervision is costly.

Method: Uses a frozen pretrained vision backbone with tiny convolutional adapters, incremental expansion via uncertainty-gated admission, and k-NN anomaly scoring with a compact coreset.

Result: Significant performance gains on datasets like COVID-CXR (ROC-AUC: 0.9489 to 0.9982) and Pneumonia CXR (ROC-AUC: 0.6834 to 0.8968).

Conclusion: The framework is effective and efficient for label-scarce medical imaging, avoiding drift and false inclusions without generative methods.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [8] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) and Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) to improve temporal action localization by addressing boundary detection and computation allocation, achieving significant performance gains with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for temporal action localization uniformly process boundaries despite varying difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. The goal is to enhance precision and computational efficiency.

Method: BDR replaces classification with signed-distance regression for sharper boundary detection, while ATR dynamically allocates computation using continuous depth selection, avoiding reinforcement learning. Knowledge distillation mitigates training costs.

Result: BDR improves mAP@0.7 by 1.8 to 3.1% across architectures. ATR achieves 56.5% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs, outperforming uniform processing (53.6% at 198G). Short actions see a 4.2% improvement. Lightweight models retain 99% performance.

Conclusion: The proposed BDR and ATR methods significantly enhance temporal action localization by optimizing boundary detection and computation, validated across benchmarks with rigorous testing.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [9] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for joint optimization of mesh geometry and appearance in 3D reconstruction, enhancing downstream editing tasks like relighting and shape deformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D reconstruction often separate geometry and appearance optimization, limiting their usability in editing tasks. The paper aims to unify these aspects for seamless results.

Method: The framework simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions and faces) and vertex colors using Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering, leveraging photometric consistency and geometric regularization from input images, normal, and depth maps.

Result: The approach achieves high-quality 3D reconstruction that is suitable for further editing tasks due to its unified optimization of geometry and appearance.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges the gap between geometric accuracy and photorealistic rendering, enabling more effective downstream editing applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

### [10] [A Linear Fractional Transformation Model and Calibration Method for Light Field Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03962)
*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using linear fractional transformation parameter α decouples the main lens and micro lens array for accurate calibration in light field cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is essential for 3D reconstruction with light field cameras but remains challenging.

Method: Proposes a linear fractional transformation parameter α, an analytical solution via least squares, nonlinear refinement, and a feature detection method.

Result: Validated on physical and simulated data, the method improves calibration accuracy and speeds up simulation of raw light field images.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances calibration accuracy and simulation speed, supporting data-driven deep learning methods.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [11] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A synthetic dataset, Room Envelopes, is introduced to aid in reconstructing occluded structural elements like walls and floors from RGB images, enabling better scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on visible surfaces, missing occluded ones like walls and floors, which are simpler and predictable.

Method: The paper presents Room Envelopes, a dataset with RGB images and pointmaps (visible and structural surfaces) for supervised learning.

Result: The dataset allows direct supervision for monocular geometry estimators to predict visible and structural surfaces.

Conclusion: Room Envelopes facilitates better scene reconstruction by predicting occluded structural elements, enhancing scene understanding.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [12] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans use 3D visuospatial pose information for social interaction recognition, outperforming AI models. Simple 3D social pose features improve AI performance and predict human-like judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how humans recognize social interactions visually and why AI struggles with this task, focusing on the role of 3D pose information.

Method: Researchers combined pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions from videos and compared their performance with AI models. They also derived minimal 3D social pose features.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed AI models. Minimal pose features matched full joint data and boosted AI performance when combined. Representation of pose features in AI models predicted their human-like judgment accuracy.

Conclusion: Human social scene understanding relies on explicit 3D pose representations, and structured visuospatial primitives can enhance AI models.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

### [13] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaRF, a framework for 3D Gaussian splatting segmentation that improves multi-view consistency using camera-aware techniques like GFCE and ITPVS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with cross-view consistency in 3D segmentation due to reliance on 2D pseudo supervision and view-specific features. CaRF aims to address these limitations.

Method: CaRF incorporates Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) to model view-dependent variations and uses In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) to align Gaussian logits across views, improving consistency and reducing overfitting.

Result: CaRF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU on Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: The work enhances 3D scene understanding with improved view consistency, benefiting applications like embodied AI, AR/VR, and autonomous perception.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

*Peiyao Wang,Weining Wang,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysCorr, a framework to improve physical consistency in text-to-video generation, addressing issues like implausible dynamics and incoherent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack physical plausibility, limiting their use in domains like robotics and embodied AI.

Method: Proposes PhysicsRM (a dual-dimensional reward model) and PhyDPO (a preference optimization pipeline) to enhance physical consistency.

Result: PhysCorr significantly improves physical realism without compromising visual quality or semantic alignment.

Conclusion: The work advances physically grounded video generation, making it more reliable for practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing enhances robust, lightweight domain generalization.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

*Mahmoud Soliman,Islam Osman,Mohamed S. Shehata,Rasika Rajapakshe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedDChest introduces a Vision Transformer optimized for thoracic imaging, pre-trained on 1.2M medical images, outperforming ImageNet models with domain-specific augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the domain gap in medical imaging by replacing natural image pre-training with in-domain data.

Method: Pre-trained MedDChest on curated multimodal datasets using Guided Random Resized Crops augmentation.

Result: Outperforms ImageNet models on thoracic diagnostic tasks.

Conclusion: MedDChest proves in-domain pre-training and domain-specific augmentation enhance medical imaging models.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring is a sparse voxelized representation method offering high-resolution, near-lossless fidelity for 3D meshes without requiring water-tightening or rendering optimization, excelling in accuracy and efficiency for representation and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxelized representations compromise geometric fidelity due to reliance on iso-surface methods like water-tightening or rendering optimization. Faithful Contouring aims to overcome these limitations for arbitrary meshes.

Method: The paper proposes Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation supporting 2048+ resolutions, avoiding field function conversion or isosurface extraction. It includes a dual-mode autoencoder for scalable, detail-preserving shape reconstruction.

Result: Faithful Contouring achieves $10^{-5}$ level distance errors for representation and outperforms baselines with a 93% Chamfer Distance reduction and 35% F-score improvement for reconstruction.

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring excels in geometric fidelity, flexibility, and efficiency, making it superior for 3D learning tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight biometric authentication framework using PPG signals from fingertip videos, achieving 98% accuracy with a hybrid deep learning model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals are promising for biometric authentication but face challenges like motion artifacts and variability, necessitating robust feature extraction and classification.

Method: A hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model is developed, combining spatial and temporal features from PPG signals preprocessed using PCA, filtering, and CWT.

Result: The model achieves 98% authentication accuracy on the CFIHSR dataset, showing robustness to noise and variability.

Conclusion: The system is efficient, scalable, and suitable for real-world biometric security applications due to its liveness detection and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

*Zehui Feng,Chenqi Zhang,Mingru Wang,Minuo Wei,Shiwei Cheng,Cuntai Guan,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix is a multimodal framework aligning vision and brain signals with language to improve interpretability and robustness in decoding neural activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with subject variability and entangled visual features, lacking semantic depth and robustness.

Method: Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical components, projects them into a shared latent space, and uses uncertainty-aware weighting and language-anchored matrices.

Result: Bratrix outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 14.3% in EEG retrieval and shows improvements in reconstruction and captioning.

Conclusion: Bratrix effectively aligns neural signals with semantic language embeddings, enhancing interpretability and performance.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates two unpaired and self-supervised CT image denoising methods, CycleGAN and Noise2Score, finding CycleGAN superior in final image quality while Noise2Score excels with very noisy inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address CT image denoising in scenarios where paired or labeled training data is unavailable, exploring robust and efficient methods.

Method: Comparative evaluation of CycleGAN (with U-Net backbone) and Noise2Score under a unified protocol, including hyperparameter tuning and extended training.

Result: CycleGAN improves metrics (PSNR: 34.66→38.913 dB, SSIM: 0.9234→0.971) and outperforms Noise2Score in final quality, though N2S excels with extreme noise.

Conclusion: CycleGAN is superior for final denoising quality, while Noise2Score is a viable pair-free alternative, especially for highly noisy inputs.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

*Nishchal Sapkota,Haoyan Shi,Yejia Zhang,Xianshi Ma,Bofang Zheng,Danny Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKAST, a U-Net-like architecture, combines rational-function-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Swin Transformer encoders, improving data efficiency and performance in medical image segmentation over CNN- and Transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to complex anatomical structures and limited annotated data. CNNs handle local features but lack long-range dependency modeling, while Transformers are data-hungry and computationally expensive. UKAST aims to address these limitations.

Method: UKAST integrates rational-function-based KANs into Swin Transformer encoders, using Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) for efficiency. This reduces FLOPs and maintains a small parameter increase compared to SwinUNETR.

Result: UKAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, excelling in data-scarce settings and outperforming CNN- and Transformer-based baselines.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential of KAN-enhanced Transformers for advancing data-efficient medical image segmentation. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

TL;DR: SpatialLock improves T2I synthesis by enhancing precise object localization using perception signals and grounding information, achieving high IOU scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I synthesis methods struggle with precise object localization due to underutilized positional information.

Method: Proposes SpatialLock with Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG) components to integrate spatial data and refine localization.

Result: Achieves IOU scores above 0.9, setting a new state-of-the-art for precise object positioning.

Conclusion: SpatialLock effectively addresses object localization challenges, improving both spatial accuracy and visual quality in generated images.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG is a training-free strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling using a multirate ODE system, reducing computations by up to 30% without losing fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diffusion sampling efficiency by exploiting redundancy in guidance terms while maintaining high-quality generation.

Method: Formulates CFG ODE as a multirate system, integrates noise and guidance on different timestep grids, and introduces adaptive timestep and guidance-scale schedulers.

Result: Achieves up to 30% reduction in function evaluations with minimal fidelity loss, outperforming existing CFG-based accelerators.

Conclusion: THG demonstrates the potential of multirate formulations for efficient, high-quality diffusion sampling without retraining.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch generation methods lack precise style control, limiting their flexibility and quality.

Method: Proposes a training-free framework leveraging diffusion models with textual prompts and reference sketches, using linear smoothing and style-content guidance to reduce content leakage and enhance quality.

Result: Achieves high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved flexibility, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables precise and flexible style control in sketch generation, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

*Shengyu Tang,Zeyuan Lu,Jiazhi Dong,Changdong Yu,Xiaoyu Wang,Yaohui Lyu,Weihao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMSORT is a maritime multi-object tracking method combining detection, re-identification, and camera motion compensation to enhance robustness in challenging maritime environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The maritime environment's complexity causes camera motion and visual degradation, complicating multi-object tracking for safe navigation and surveillance.

Method: DMSORT uses parallel branches for object detection/ReID and camera motion compensation, integrating RCDN for detection and Li-TAE for appearance features, with motion stabilization via Kalman filtering.

Result: DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Singapore Maritime Dataset, offering fast runtime and high identity consistency despite jitter and occlusion.

Conclusion: DMSORT is an efficient and robust solution for maritime MOT, balancing speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework enabling computer-use agents to learn from online tutorial videos at inference time, outperforming base agents and text-only variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer-use agents lag behind humans in domain-specific tasks requiring procedural knowledge. Humans learn from video tutorials, but agents lack this capability.

Method: The framework retrieves videos, converts them into structured trajectories using a VLM, segments actions, assigns textual objectives, and dynamically selects trajectories for guidance.

Result: Experiments show consistent outperformance over base agents and text-only variants, highlighting the effectiveness of visual guidance.

Conclusion: Online videos can be systematically distilled into actionable guidance, improving computer-use agents' performance.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB) for evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations and presents a fast, accurate rotation classification pipeline using Phi-3.5-Vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Correcting document orientation is crucial for improving OCR performance, as misalignment from incorrect camera angles often occurs.

Method: The authors create ORB, a benchmark with English and multilingual datasets, and develop a rotation classification pipeline using Phi-3.5-Vision with dynamic cropping.

Result: The method achieves 96% and 92% accuracy on ORB-En and ORB-Indic. It also significantly improves OCR performance for closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x).

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is effective for rotation correction, enhancing OCR outcomes in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

### [29] [Systematic Evaluation of Preprocessing Techniques for Accurate Image Registration in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04171)
*Fatemehzahra Darzi,Rodrigo Escobar Diaz Guerrero,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how color transformation techniques improve image registration in digital pathology, finding CycleGAN most effective in reducing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate registration of images from different modalities is crucial for applications like biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction in digital pathology.

Method: The research used 20 tissue sample pairs, applying preprocessing steps (color transformations, inversion, etc.) and registering them with VALIS. Performance was evaluated using rTRE metrics and a custom point-based method.

Result: CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors in both original and inverted multimodal image scenarios.

Conclusion: Color transformation before registration enhances alignment and reliability in digital pathology analyses.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

*Josef Mayr,Anna Reithmeir,Maxime Di Folco,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Covariance descriptors from pre-trained vision encoders outperform handcrafted ones in medical image classification, especially when paired with SPDNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the effectiveness of covariance descriptors in medical imaging, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders.

Method: Construct covariance descriptors from GVE features (DINOv2, MedSAM) and compare with handcrafted descriptors using SPDNet.

Result: GVE-derived descriptors perform better than handcrafted ones; SPDNet with DINOv2 features outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained encoders shows promise for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

### [31] [AStF: Motion Style Transfer via Adaptive Statistics Fusor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04192)
*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF) method for human motion style transfer, incorporating skewness and kurtosis alongside mean and variance to better capture motion dynamics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion style transfer methods relying solely on mean and variance fail to fully capture complex motion dynamics and spatiotemporal coherence. The paper aims to address this limitation by integrating higher-order statistics.

Method: Proposes AStF with Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn), trained alongside Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.

Result: AStF demonstrates superior performance in motion style transfer by modeling spatiotemporal statistical patterns more comprehensively.

Conclusion: Incorporating skewness and kurtosis enhances motion style transfer, making AStF a state-of-the-art solution.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits human-centric foundation models for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, introducing MedSapiens, which outperforms existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of human-centric foundation models for medical landmark detection, leveraging their inherent spatial localization strengths.

Method: Adapts Sapiens, a human-centric model for pose estimation, to medical imaging via multi-dataset pretraining, resulting in MedSapiens.

Result: MedSapiens achieves up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% over specialist models in detection rates, with strong few-shot performance.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models like Sapiens provide strong priors for medical landmark detection, demonstrating significant performance gains and adaptability.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet is a framework for synthetic image and deepfake attribution, leveraging latent signal leaks in diffusion models for interpretable and robust source identification without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of verifying authenticity and attributing sources for synthetic images and deepfakes due to advancements in generation models.

Method: Proto-LeakNet integrates closed-set classification with open-set evaluation, re-simulating partial forward diffusion to expose generator-specific cues, using temporal attention and feature-weighted prototypes.

Result: Achieves Macro AUC of 98.13%, robust performance under post-processing, and strong separability between known and unseen generators.

Conclusion: Modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable forensics for AI-generated images and deepfakes.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

*Yujie Yang,Shuang Li,Jun Ye,Neng Dong,Fan Li,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning (DinoGRL) framework is proposed for Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification, combining gait and appearance features for robust cross-modal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook gait features, which are modality-invariant and rich in temporal dynamics, limiting spatiotemporal consistency in cross-modal video matching.

Method: Introduces SASGL for semantic-aware silhouette and gait learning, and PBMGE for progressive bidirectional multi-granularity enhancement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets.

Conclusion: DinoGRL effectively leverages gait and appearance features, achieving superior cross-modal retrieval performance.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Shiwei Ren,Tianci Wen,Yongchun Fang,Biao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastGS is a novel acceleration framework for 3D Gaussian splatting that optimizes training time by regulating Gaussian importance via multi-view consistency, achieving significant speed improvements with comparable rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods inefficiently manage the number of Gaussians during training, leading to redundant computations. FastGS aims to address this by leveraging multi-view consistency.

Method: FastGS introduces a densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, eliminating the need for a budgeting mechanism. This optimizes the trade-off between training time and rendering quality.

Result: Experiments show FastGS achieves 3.32× training acceleration on Mip-NeRF 360, 15.45× on Deep Blending, and 2-7× across various tasks like dynamic scene reconstruction and SLAM, while maintaining rendering quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FastGS delivers a simple, general, and effective solution for accelerating 3D Gaussian splatting, demonstrating strong performance and versatility across diverse applications.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

*Leire Benito-Del-Valle,Artzai Picón,Daniel Mugica,Manuel Ramos,Eva Portillo,Javier Romero,Carlos Javier Jimenez,Ramón Navarra-Mestre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-specific vision model adapted for herbicide trials outperforms general-purpose models in species identification and damage classification, especially under unseen conditions, and reduces annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate plant species and herbicide damage assessment in diverse environments requires fine-grained visual distinctions, which general-purpose models may not adequately address.

Method: A general-purpose vision foundation model is adapted using self-supervised learning on a large agricultural dataset to optimize for herbicide trial images.

Result: The domain-specific model improves F1 scores for species identification (0.91 to 0.94) and damage classification (0.26 to 0.33), with even greater gains under unseen conditions. It also enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces annotation requirements.

Conclusion: Domain-specific foundation models offer scalable, automated solutions for herbicide trial analysis, improving accuracy and reducing manual annotation efforts.

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study uses synthetic and real satellite imagery to train YOLOv10 models for detecting offshore infrastructure, improving performance with synthetic data and demonstrating geographic transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective monitoring of expanding marine infrastructure requires robust models, but limited data for underrepresented classes hinders performance.

Method: Combined synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery from four regions trained YOLOv10 models, tested on three unseen regions.

Result: Detected 3,529 platforms with F1 score of 0.85 (improved to 0.90 with synthetic data), proving model generalizability.

Conclusion: Synthetic data enhances model performance and representation of unbalanced classes, advancing scalable global monitoring.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

*Xiangjun Zhang,Litong Gong,Yinglin Zheng,Yansong Liu,Wentao Jiang,Mingyi Xu,Biao Wang,Tiezheng Ge,Ming Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE-T2V improves text-to-video generation by integrating prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into one step, enhancing alignment with user intent and video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V models struggle with concise prompts due to limited textual semantics understanding and cannot rephrase prompts dynamically.

Method: RISE-T2V introduces a Rephrasing Adapter to utilize LLM text hidden states for video generation, implicitly rephrasing prompts.

Result: The framework enhances T2V models' ability to generate high-quality videos aligned with user intent, applicable to various architectures.

Conclusion: RISE-T2V is versatile and significantly improves T2V tasks by integrating prompt rephrasing and semantic extraction seamlessly.

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage method combining voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks for automated 3D tumor segmentation in CT scans, achieving high accuracy and reduced computational resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating tumor segmentation in medical imaging is crucial but computationally intensive; current methods often require downsampling or patching, limiting their practicality.

Method: The proposed method involves voxel sparsification followed by submanifold sparse convolutional networks, enabling high-resolution 3D segmentation with lower computational demands.

Result: The method achieved high Dice scores (95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7% for tumours + cysts, 80.3% for tumours alone) and reduced inference time by 60% and VRAM usage by 75% compared to dense architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a computationally efficient and accurate solution for 3D tumor segmentation, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study examines how sensor occlusions affect 3D object detection in BEV-based fusion, showing significant performance drops for both camera and LiDAR, with fusion performance varying by sensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of sensor occlusions (e.g., fog, obstructions) on 3D object detection accuracy in automated vehicles using BEV representations.

Method: Evaluated BEVFusion architecture on nuScenes dataset, measuring mAP and NDS under occlusion scenarios for camera, LiDAR, and fused settings.

Result: Camera occlusions cause a 41.3% mAP drop, LiDAR a 47.3% drop under heavy occlusion. Fused settings show a 4.1% drop for camera occlusion and 26.8% for LiDAR occlusion.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for occlusion-aware methods and better fusion techniques to mitigate performance drops in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Result: The tutorial successfully bridges the gap by offering practical instructions and code examples for integrating deep learning with imaging data analysis in analytical chemistry.

Conclusion: The work concludes by emphasizing the significance of providing accessible, structured guidance for implementing deep learning in analytical chemistry, enabling readers to apply these techniques to their own datasets.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial

learning, (2) a synthetically enriched explanation dataset offering structured
medical reasoning, and (3) text-to-region pairs linking visual features with
segmentation masks. This multi-task setup enables the model to jointly learn
visual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are
both accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer
accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded
multi-task learning for medical VQA applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular depth estimation methods struggle with poor performance and blurred boundaries on embedded systems.

Method: BoRe-Depth introduces an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) for better boundary detail representation and integrates semantic knowledge into the encoder.

Result: The model outperforms previous lightweight models on challenging datasets and achieves 50.7 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson Orin.

Conclusion: BoRe-Depth is an efficient and accurate solution for monocular depth estimation on embedded systems.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low?cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

### [46] [HideAndSeg: an AI-based tool with automated prompting for octopus segmentation in natural habitats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04426)
*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HideAndSeg is a minimally supervised AI tool for segmenting octopus videos, combining SAM2 and YOLOv11 to automate segmentation with unsupervised metrics for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Octopuses are hard to analyze in natural habitats due to camouflage and environmental challenges, and annotated datasets are scarce.

Method: HideAndSeg uses SAM2 for initial masks and trains YOLOv11 for automation, with unsupervised metrics ($DICE_t$ and $NC_t$) guiding refinement.

Result: The tool performs well, reducing noise and handling occlusions better than manual methods.

Conclusion: HideAndSeg enables efficient octopus behavioral studies by minimizing manual intervention.

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on expanding computational jigsaw puzzle solvers beyond square pieces to Convex Partitions, leveraging geometric and pictorial similarities and introducing a greedy solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing puzzle solvers are limited to square pieces, restricting practical applications. The work aims to address this by tackling Convex Partitions.

Method: Uses geometrical and pictorial compatibilities and introduces a greedy solver.

Result: Presents performance measures and the first benchmark dataset for Convex Partition puzzles.

Conclusion: Expands the scope of computational puzzle-solving to more complex polygonal puzzles, enhancing practical utility.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

TL;DR: V-Thinker is a multimodal reasoning assistant that enhances image interaction and reasoning via reinforcement learning, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating deep image interaction with long-horizon reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs) by overcoming limited visual tool spaces and task-specific designs.

Method: Introduces V-Thinker with two components: (1) Data Evolution Flywheel for synthesizing and evolving interactive reasoning datasets, and (2) Visual Progressive Training Curriculum aligning perception and reasoning via reinforcement learning. Also introduces VTBench, a benchmark for vision-centric tasks.

Result: V-Thinker outperforms LMM-based baselines in general and interactive reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: V-Thinker advances image-interactive reasoning, offering insights for future multimodal applications.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-axis framework (sensor, label, domain) to adapt GeoFMs for landslide mapping, showing superior performance over traditional models and other GeoFMs, while addressing challenges like computational cost and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landslides cause significant damage, and existing deep learning models struggle with cross-sensor, cross-region applicability and limited training data.

Method: The study uses a geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0) with global pretraining, self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning.

Result: The model outperforms task-specific CNNs, vision transformers, and other GeoFMs, demonstrating resilience to spectral variation and label scarcity.

Conclusion: GeoFMs offer a robust, scalable solution for landslide risk reduction, though challenges like computational cost and data availability remain.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

*Nabyl Quignon,Baptiste Chopin,Yaohui Wang,Antitza Dantcheva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation framework with 8 metrics for talking head video generation, addressing gaps in current assessment methods. It evaluates quality, naturalness, and synchronization, and tests the framework on 85,000 videos from 17 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for talking head generation are limited and fail to comprehensively assess video quality, naturalness, and synchronization. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework includes 8 metrics focused on quality, naturalness, and synchronization. It analyzes fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, eyebrows, and face quality, prioritizing efficiency and human alignment.

Result: Experiments reveal that while many models perform well in lip synchronization, they struggle with expressiveness and artifact-free details. A novel real dataset was curated to reduce training data bias.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark framework aims to standardize evaluation in the field, with plans to release code, datasets, and leaderboards publicly to track progress.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

TL;DR: STC-Net automates surgical complexity assessment in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy using the Parkland Grading Scale, outperforming baselines by 10% with weak supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is crucial due to its impact on operative times and complications, but existing methods lack automation for full videos.

Method: STC-Net uses weak temporal supervision to analyze full videos, combining localization, window proposal, and grading modules with novel loss formulations.

Result: STC-Net achieved 62.11% accuracy and 61.42% F1-score, outperforming baselines by over 10%.

Conclusion: STC-Net offers a scalable, effective solution for automated complexity estimation, useful for post-operative analysis and training.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSplat is a feed-forward framework for dynamic scene reconstruction in autonomous driving, using a 3D latent scaffold and efficient fusion to handle sparse, non-overlapping views and complex dynamics. It achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with sparse, non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics in autonomous driving. UniSplat aims to address these challenges by providing robust dynamic scene reconstruction.

Method: UniSplat constructs a 3D latent scaffold leveraging pretrained models, integrates spatio-temporal fusion directly in the scaffold, and uses a dual-branch decoder for dynamic-aware Gaussians and persistent memory of static Gaussians.

Result: UniSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and provides high-quality renderings for viewpoints outside original camera coverage.

Conclusion: UniSplat effectively handles dynamic scene reconstruction challenges in autonomous driving, offering robust and detailed reconstructions beyond current camera coverage.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP enhances CLIP by combining visual prompts and long-form text processing to improve fine-grained image-text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on increasing visual granularity or using detailed textual descriptions, but CLIP's text encoder limitations hinder fine-grained alignment. PixCLIP aims to overcome this by integrating both approaches.

Method: PixCLIP introduces an automated pipeline for pixel-level annotations, builds the LongGRIT dataset, replaces CLIP's text encoder with an LLM, and uses a three-branch framework for fine-grained alignment.

Result: PixCLIP achieves breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and long-form text handling, delivering state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully synergizes visual prompt inputs and lengthy textual descriptions, advancing fine-grained vision-language alignment.

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework to evaluate the accuracy of virtual IHC stains generated from H&E images, using stain-specific metrics instead of traditional image fidelity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for virtual IHC stains focus on image fidelity rather than accurate pixel-level labeling, which is critical for clinical utility.

Method: The framework uses color deconvolution to generate masks of IHC-positive pixels and compares them between real and virtual IHC using metrics like Dice, IoU, and Hausdorff distance.

Result: Paired models (e.g., PyramidPix2Pix, AdaptiveNCE) outperform unpaired models in stain accuracy, while traditional metrics (FID, PSNR, SSIM) poorly correlate with pathologist assessments. Whole-slide evaluations reveal additional performance issues.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a reproducible and accuracy-focused method to assess virtual IHC models, addressing limitations of current metrics and supporting clinical adoption.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

*Kylie Cancilla,Alexander Moore,Amar Saini,Carmen Carrano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable, streaming-based no-reference and opinion-unaware video quality assessment (VQA) model that leverages synthetic degradations and a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to predict full-reference metrics without requiring clean references or human labels during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods have limitations: full-reference metrics need clean reference videos, while most no-reference models rely on expensive human-labeled data. Additionally, opinion-unaware methods often ignore temporal context, which is crucial for video tasks.

Method: The model uses synthetic degradations of the DAVIS dataset to train a temporal-aware convolutional architecture. It predicts full-reference metrics (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, avoiding the need for clean references or human labels at inference.

Result: The streaming-based approach outperforms image-based baselines by generalizing across diverse degradations and achieves higher correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used opinion-aware image quality baseline.

Conclusion: The work highlights the value of temporal modeling for scalable, real-world VQA systems and validates the effectiveness of the proposed opinion-unaware, temporal-aware approach.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

TL;DR: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging enhances eye tracking by measuring light polarization states alongside intensity, improving accuracy under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve eye tracking accuracy by leveraging polarization effects of light reflected by ocular tissues.

Method: A polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system using a polarization-filter-array camera and linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator.

Result: PET reduced median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10-16% compared to intensity-only methods.

Conclusion: PET offers practical benefits for human-computer interaction and wearable devices due to its robustness.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

*Ellis Brown,Jihan Yang,Shusheng Yang,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to diagnose and debias multimodal benchmarks, revealing and mitigating non-visual biases in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can be exploited without strong visual understanding, undermining their validity for vision-centric tasks.

Method: The framework includes a Test-set Stress-Test (TsT) to diagnose biases via fine-tuning and Random Forest analysis, followed by Iterative Bias Pruning (IBP) to debias benchmarks.

Result: Application to four benchmarks (VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, VideoMME) revealed pervasive non-visual biases. VSI-Bench-Debiased showed reduced bias and improved vision-blind performance gap.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively identifies and mitigates non-visual biases in multimodal benchmarks, enhancing their robustness for evaluating MLLMs.

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

*Ellis Brown,Arijit Ray,Ranjay Krishna,Ross Girshick,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIMS-V is a framework using 3D simulators to generate spatially-rich video training data, identifying key question types for effective real-world transfer in multimodal language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial training relies on real-world video data with precise annotations, which is hard to obtain. SIMS-V addresses this by leveraging 3D simulators.

Method: The framework generates diverse simulated data and systematically ablates question types, mixes, and scales to identify effective training properties.

Result: A minimal set of three question types (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, temporal tracking) outperforms comprehensive coverage, enabling efficient training. A 7B-parameter model fine-tuned on 25K examples surpasses larger baselines.

Conclusion: SIMS-V demonstrates robust generalization, improving spatial reasoning while maintaining general video understanding, offering a scalable solution for multimodal models.

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

*Shusheng Yang,Jihan Yang,Pinzhi Huang,Ellis Brown,Zihao Yang,Yue Yu,Shengbang Tong,Zihan Zheng,Yifan Xu,Muhan Wang,Daohan Lu,Rob Fergus,Yann LeCun,Li Fei-Fei,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting from reactive systems to 'supersensing' for multimodal intelligence, introducing benchmarks (VSI-SUPER) and showing limitations of scaling alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack depth in spatial cognition and world modeling, limiting progress in multimodal intelligence.

Method: Introduces VSI-SUPER (VSR and VSC tasks), tests data scaling with VSI-590K, and proposes predictive sensing with a next-latent-frame predictor.

Result: Scale improves VSI-Bench (+30%) but not VSI-SUPER. Predictive sensing outperforms proprietary baselines.

Conclusion: Spatial supersensing needs models that anticipate and organize, not just scale.

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

### [60] [InfinityStar: Unified Spacetime AutoRegressive Modeling for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04675)
*Jinlai Liu,Jian Han,Bin Yan,Hui Wu,Fengda Zhu,Xing Wang,Yi Jiang,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityStar is a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for high-resolution image and video synthesis, outperforming existing models in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and high-quality video and image generation by unifying spatial and temporal dependencies in a single autoregressive framework.

Method: InfinityStar uses a purely discrete autoregressive approach to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies, supporting tasks like text-to-image, text-to-video, and interactive video synthesis.

Result: The model achieves a VBench score of 83.74, outperforms other autoregressive models, and generates 720p videos 10x faster than diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: InfinityStar is the first industrial-level 720p video generator in its class, with released code and models to advance research in efficient video generation.

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,
high-quality video generation.

### [61] [Tracking and Understanding Object Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04678)
*Yihong Sun,Xinyu Yang,Jennifer J. Sun,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task called Track Any State for tracking objects through transformations and detecting state changes, proposing a zero-shot system, TubeletGraph, to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to track objects after significant appearance changes due to transformations, necessitating a solution for continuous tracking and state understanding.

Method: TubeletGraph recovers missing objects post-transformation using semantic and proximity priors, then constructs a state graph to describe observed transformations.

Result: TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance and demonstrates advanced understanding of object transformations, temporal grounding, and semantic reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively tracks objects through transformations and provides deeper insights into state changes, with potential applications in complex object dynamics.

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of methods for generating multiple aesthetically distinct image crops, introduces a dataset, and evaluates single-crop models with a partitioning algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern social media applications often require multiple distinct and aesthetically appealing image crops, which current single-crop techniques don't address.

Method: The authors introduce a dataset of 277 images with human labels and evaluate single-crop models combined with an image partitioning algorithm.

Result: The study highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach for generating multiple distinct crops, and the dataset is made publicly available.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in image cropping by enabling multiple aesthetic crops, supported by empirical evaluation and an open dataset.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping is a method for maximizing the human-perceived
quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed
techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem
of producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we
motivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications,
introduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the
efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as
a pre-processing step. The dataset is available at

### [63] [Activation-Space Personality Steering: Hybrid Layer Selection for Stable Trait Control in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03738)
*Pranav Bhandari,Nicolas Fay,Sanjeevan Selvaganapathy,Amitava Datta,Usman Naseem,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel pipeline to control and align personality traits in Large Language Models using the Big Five Traits, enabling precise behavioral steering without compromising model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs exhibit implicit personalities, but reliable control and alignment of these traits to meet specific needs remain an open challenge. The lack of effective behavioral manipulation mechanisms during generation is a critical gap.

Method: A pipeline extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using the Big Five Personality Traits. It applies low-rank subspace discovery and identifies trait-specific optimal layers for robust injection. A flexible steering framework with dynamic layer selection is used for precise control.

Result: Personality traits occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and latent structures can be transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering. Perturbations do not impact fluency, variance, or general capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between psychological theory and practical model alignment, offering precise control over trait expression in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

TL;DR: The paper explores three multi-agent LLM pipelines for improving SQL generation from natural language, demonstrating performance gains in small models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing Large Language Models in generating SQL from natural instructions due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning.

Method: Introduces three multi-agent LLM pipelines: Multi-agent discussion, Planner-Coder, and Coder-Aggregator, tested on small to large open-source models.

Result: Multi-agent discussion improved small model performance by up to 10.6%, while the Planner-Coder pipeline achieved the highest accuracy of 56.4% with certain models.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM pipelines can enhance SQL generation, especially for smaller models, with the Planner-Coder approach being the most effective.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

TL;DR: TextualVerifier is a self-verification framework for TextGrad, using LLM-based techniques to improve reasoning validity without numerical gradients. It shows significant improvements in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of self-verification in TextGrad, ensuring reasoning validity in text-based decision making.

Method: A four-stage workflow: chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and consensus aggregation, integrated with TextGrad.

Result: 29% improvement in reasoning validity and 2.2 percentage point gain in TextGrad's performance, with benchmarks showing further improvements.

Conclusion: TextualVerifier enhances TextGrad's reliability without requiring numerical gradients, opening new avenues for text-based optimization verification.

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the existing GRDD dataset with additional Greek dialectal data and evaluate the effect of high-quality dialectal data on LLM performance.

Method: Extended the GRDD dataset with new varieties, then fine-tuned three LLM architectures (Llama-3-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Krikri-8B) and compared results to frontier models.

Result: Created the largest and most varied Greek dialectal dataset to date (GRDD+), and showed performance comparisons across fine-tuned and frontier models.

Conclusion: The GRDD+ dataset is a significant resource for dialectal NLP, and fine-tuning with it yields insights into LLM performance on diverse dialects.

Abstract: We present an extended Greek Dialectal Dataset (GRDD+) 1that complements the
existing GRDD dataset with more data from Cretan, Cypriot, Pontic and Northern
Greek, while we add six new varieties: Greco-Corsican, Griko (Southern Italian
Greek), Maniot, Heptanesian, Tsakonian, and Katharevusa Greek. The result is a
dataset with total size 6,374,939 words and 10 varieties. This is the first
dataset with such variation and size to date. We conduct a number of
fine-tuning experiments to see the effect of good quality dialectal data on a
number of LLMs. We fine-tune three model architectures (Llama-3-8B,
Llama-3.1-8B, Krikri-8B) and compare the results to frontier models
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5, ChatGPT-5).

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational Turing test to validate LLM-generated text's realism and compares nine LLMs, finding they struggle to match human communication despite calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text and calibrating models to real-world data, given the unreliable nature of human-judgment-based evaluations.

Method: Introduces a validation framework combining aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability, semantic similarity) and interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers, topical patterns). Compares nine LLMs across five calibration strategies in reproducing user interactions on social platforms.

Result: LLM outputs are distinguishable from human text, especially in affective tone and emotional expression. Instruction-tuned models underperform, and model size scaling doesn't improve human-likeness. A trade-off exists between human-likeness and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable framework for LLM validation and calibration but highlights current limitations in capturing human communication, cautioning against over-reliance on LLMs for simulating human behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models

*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb,Mikhail Kuznetsov,Muslum Ozgur Ozmen,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARS is a decoding-time algorithm for aligning large language models with human values, outperforming existing methods like fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling in efficiency and alignment quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for aligning large language models, such as fine-tuning, are computationally expensive and suboptimal, while inference-time approaches like Best-of-N sampling are impractical for optimal alignment.

Method: STARS (Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling) iteratively samples, scores, and accepts/rejects short, fixed-size token segments during decoding to steer model generation efficiently.

Result: STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization by up to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining competitive with Best-of-N baselines.

Conclusion: Granular, reward-guided sampling (STARS) is a robust and efficient alternative for aligning large language models, offering significant improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for efficient multi-label text classification using LLMs, decomposing tasks into yes/no queries and leveraging distillation for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in multi-label text classification with LLMs by breaking tasks into simpler dichotomic decisions and leveraging distillation for better performance.

Method: Reformulates classification as sequences of yes/no decisions, uses prefix caching for efficiency, and employs LLM-to-SLM distillation to fine-tune smaller models.

Result: Fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot baselines, especially on trained dimensions, with maintained accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, effective framework for LLM-based classification, validated on affective states but applicable across domains.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

Motivation: To address the risks of prioritizing quantity over quality in datasets for low-resourced languages, particularly focusing on gender representation and harmful content.

Method: Analysis of Machine Translation datasets for Afan Oromo, Amharic, and Tigrinya, with emphasis on gender representation, domain distribution, and harmful depictions.

Result: Findings reveal skewed gender representation (male-dominated), domain imbalances, and harmful content, with larger datasets showing more toxicity.

Conclusion: The study calls for careful dataset curation to mitigate biases and harmful content in low-resourced language technologies.

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

### [72] [GRAD: Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03900)
*Manh Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Dai Do,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAD is a decoding-time method that uses corpus-derived evidence to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, outperforming baselines in accuracy and reducing hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination mitigation in LLMs is challenging, and existing methods are either fragile or costly. GRAD aims to provide a lightweight, effective solution.

Method: GRAD constructs a sparse token transition graph from corpus-derived logits and adaptively fuses them with model logits during decoding.

Result: GRAD improves intrinsic accuracy by 9.7%, reduces hallucination rates by 8.6%, and increases correctness by 6.9% compared to greedy decoding.

Conclusion: GRAD is a plug-and-play method that effectively leverages corpus-level token transitions to enhance truthfulness and verifiability in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

TL;DR: The paper examines iterated reference games, comparing human and model performance with varying context relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate agents' ability for context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments.

Method: Testing humans and vision-language models on iterated reference games, varying context amount, order, and relevance.

Result: Models performed above chance without relevant context but worse than humans. With relevant context, model performance improved significantly.

Conclusion: While models show promise with relevant context, few-shot reference games with abstract referents remain challenging for machine learning models.

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFGI, a high-resolution index quantifying human flourishing using geolocated tweets and LLMs, validated against established indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure societal well-being beyond economic indicators with fine spatial and temporal resolution.

Method: Analysis of 2.6B geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned LLMs to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with Harvard's framework.

Result: HFGI provides validated monthly/yearly county- and state-level flourishing indicators, correlating with existing measures.

Conclusion: HFGI enables unprecedented-resolution analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change via social media discourse.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at
unprecedented resolution, offering insights into the dynamics of human
flourishing as reflected in social media discourse across the United States
over the past decade.

### [75] [Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models via Vector Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03945)
*Fu-Chun Yang,Jason Eshraghian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using vector translations for semantic exchange between LLMs, improving information transfer without computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems pass messages as plain tokens, limiting semantics and efficiency.

Method: Learned vector translations between models (e.g., Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct) enable direct semantic exchange.

Result: A dual-encoder translator achieved 0.538 cosine alignment, and 30% vector blending steered generation stably.

Conclusion: Cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems with shared semantics.

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper integrates abductive inference into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address gaps in reasoning caused by incomplete evidence, improving answer accuracy and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented LLMs often fail when retrieved evidence is incomplete, leading to reasoning gaps. Abductive inference can bridge these gaps by generating plausible missing premises.

Method: The proposed framework detects insufficient evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through consistency and plausibility checks.

Result: Experiments on abductive reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show improved answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness.

Conclusion: Abductive inference enhances the robustness and explainability of RAG systems, offering a promising direction for future work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-FIX, a benchmark to evaluate LLM explanations for expert alignment in knowledge-intensive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation schemes for LLM explanations focus on plausibility but miss alignment with expert intuition, which is critical in expert-driven fields.

Method: Developed T-FIX, a benchmark across seven domains, in collaboration with experts, and introduced new metrics to measure explanation alignment with expert judgment.

Result: The study highlights the gap in current evaluation methods and proposes a solution to better assess LLM explanations for expert relevance.

Conclusion: Expert alignment is essential for LLM explanations in specialized fields, and T-FIX provides a framework to measure it effectively.

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

### [78] [Plan of Knowledge: Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04072)
*Xinying Qian,Ying Zhang,Yu Zhao,Baohang Zhou,Xuhui Sui,Xiaojie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoK, a framework combining structured planning and temporal knowledge retrieval to improve LLMs' temporal reasoning for TKGQA tasks, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for TKGQA struggle with complex temporal constraints and LLMs have limitations in temporal reasoning and factual consistency. PoK aims to address these gaps.

Method: PoK decomposes questions into sub-objectives using a Plan of Knowledge module and retrieves temporally aligned facts via a contrastive temporal retriever (Temporal Knowledge Store).

Result: PoK outperforms state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by up to 56.0% in retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PoK effectively enhances interpretability and factual consistency in temporal reasoning, demonstrating the potential of combining structured planning with knowledge retrieval.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

*Špela Vintar,Jan Jona Javoršek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of word associations between humans and LLMs shows moderate overlap, with LLMs amplifying emotional load and being less creative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models (LLMs) generate word associations compared to humans, especially for emotionally loaded words, and assess their potential role in creativity.

Method: Comparative analysis of associative behavior between humans and LLMs, focusing on responses to emotionally loaded word cues.

Result: Moderate overlap exists between human and LLM associations, but LLMs amplify emotional load and are less creative and predictable.

Conclusion: LLMs generate associations differently from humans, lacking the unpredictability and creativity driven by personal experience and emotions.

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated de-identification of radiology reports by scaling transformer models and benchmarking against commercial systems for PHI detection.

Method: Fine-tuning a transformer-based PHI de-identification pipeline on large annotated radiology datasets, introducing a new PHI category (AGE), and evaluating performance on test sets from Stanford and Penn.

Result: Achieved high F1 scores (0.973 on Penn, 0.996 on Stanford), outperforming commercial systems (F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754) and showing robust synthetic PHI detection.

Conclusion: The transformer-based model trained on diverse datasets sets a new benchmark for secure clinical text processing, excelling in PHI detection and privacy preservation.

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

### [81] [A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04103)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits classic language identification in the limit, extending it to list-based identification where learners output k guesses. It characterizes when k-list identification is possible and links it to decomposing the language collection into k identifiable subsets. It also establishes exponential identification rates for statistically drawn inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by recent positive results in language generation, the study explores whether allowing learners to produce a list of guesses (k guesses per step) can overcome classical limitations in language identification.

Method: The authors extend Angluin's characterization of identifiable languages to recursive versions for k-list identification. They provide a decomposition-based criterion: a collection is k-list identifiable iff it splits into k subsets each identifiable with a single guess.

Result: The paper proves k-list identification is possible if the language collection decomposes into k identifiable subsets. It also shows exponential identification rates are achievable for k-list identifiable collections.

Conclusion: The study successfully characterizes k-list identification in terms of decomposition into identifiable subsets and provides sharp rates for statistical settings, bridging classic and list-based learning.

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

TL;DR: Batch prompting improves accuracy and reduces token usage in LLMs by suppressing overthinking and encouraging decisive answers, also revealing emergent collective effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underappreciated benefits of batching in large language models, particularly its role in regularizing model behavior during multi-step reasoning.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks, analyzing behavior and token usage in batched inference.

Result: Batching improves accuracy by 3x-5x, reduces reasoning token usage, suppresses overthinking, and encourages decisive answers. Emergent collective effects were observed.

Conclusion: Batching is not only a throughput optimization but also a powerful inference-time regularizer for efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

*Xinyuan Li,Murong Xu,Wenbiao Tao,Hanlun Zhu,Yike Zhao,Jipeng Zhang,Yunshi Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIDE is an adversarial question-rewriting framework using IRT to measure and increase question difficulty, revealing LLMs' limited robustness in math reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations may inflate performance due to data leakage or pattern matching, needing adversarial methods for true reasoning assessment.

Method: RIDE uses IRT and LLM responses to build a difficulty ranker, then employs reinforcement learning to rewrite questions across difficulty levels.

Result: RIDE degrades advanced LLM performance by 21.73% on average across 26 models, exposing reasoning robustness limits.

Conclusion: RIDE effectively evaluates true mathematical reasoning by generating intrinsically challenging, well-posed questions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

TL;DR: CantoASR improves Cantonese ASR by combining acoustic feature extraction, enhanced tone discrimination, and prosody-aware language correction, outperforming existing models like Whisper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource Cantonese ASR faces challenges due to limited data, complex tones, and accent variations, necessitating better solutions.

Method: The paper proposes CantoASR, integrating forced alignment for acoustic features, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for tones, and Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware correction.

Result: CantoASR achieves significant CER improvements over Whisper-Large-V3 on spontaneous Cantonese data.

Conclusion: Combining acoustic cues with LALM reasoning offers a scalable approach for tonal and dialectal ASR in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

*Mohammed Musthafa Rafi,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Aditya Balu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAAC proposes using LLMs as intermediaries for authentic communication, addressing trust gaps in fidelity, reproducibility, and response integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the inauthentic AI-generated content cycle and foster genuine knowledge exchange.

Method: LAAC uses structured dialogue to capture sender intent and assesses trustworthiness across fidelity, reproducibility, and response integrity.

Result: Preliminary findings identify measurable trust gaps needing resolution for reliable deployment.

Conclusion: LAAC shows promise but requires further refinement to meet high-stakes communication trust standards.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if current LLMs can meet the standards of Poland's National Appeal Chamber exam, exploring their potential in legal settings.

Method: Tested LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4 Sonnet) in closed-book and Retrieval-Augmented Generation modes on exam tasks, using a hybrid information pipeline.

Result: LLMs scored well in knowledge tests but failed practical written tasks; 'LLM-as-a-judge' evaluations disagreed with human judgments.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack the reliability to replace human judges or examiners in Polish public procurement law.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

### [87] [REMIND: Input Loss Landscapes Reveal Residual Memorization in Post-Unlearning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04228)
*Liran Cohen,Yaniv Nemcovesky,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REMIND is a new method for evaluating machine unlearning by detecting residual influence in semantically similar examples, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for machine unlearning focus on individual inputs, potentially overlooking residual influence in similar examples, which can compromise privacy.

Method: REMIND analyzes the model's loss over small input variations to detect subtle residual influence of unlearned data, classifying whether the data is effectively forgotten.

Result: REMIND identifies flatter loss landscapes for unlearned data and sharper patterns for retained data, demonstrating robustness across models, datasets, and paraphrased inputs.

Conclusion: REMIND provides a sensitive, interpretable, and reliable framework for assessing unlearning effectiveness in language models, advancing understanding of memorization and unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

### [88] [Reusing Pre-Training Data at Test Time is a Compute Multiplier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04234)
*Alex Fang,Thomas Voice,Ruoming Pang,Ludwig Schmidt,Tom Gunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the efficiency of pre-training in large language models, using retrieval augmented generation and test-time compute to quantify unused dataset value. Significant accuracy gains are shown across tasks, suggesting pre-training methods underutilize existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how efficiently pre-training extracts knowledge from datasets, given the lack of research in this area despite efforts to improve datasets.

Method: Uses retrieval augmented generation and test-time compute to measure unused dataset value and its changes across scale, tested on MMLU, Math-500, and SimpleQA.

Result: Retrieval boosts accuracy significantly, acting as a ~5x compute multiplier for MMLU, with further improvements (10 percentage points) when leveraging additional test-time compute.

Conclusion: Current pre-training methods do not fully utilize dataset information, indicating substantial potential for improvement.

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

*Salma Mekaooui,Hiba Sofyan,Imane Amaaz,Imane Benchrif,Arsalane Zarghili,Ilham Chaker,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based method for topic labeling, which enriches topic words with semantically related terms and explores their relationships to assign meaningful labels, achieving better results than traditional benchmarks and comparable performance to ChatGPT-3.5 while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of unstructured textual data necessitates efficient topic extraction methods. Existing approaches are often computationally intensive, and topic modeling (TM) lacks clear interpretability due to producing topics as word distributions without labels.

Method: A graph-based approach is introduced to enrich topic words with semantically related terms and analyze their relationships to derive meaningful labels, avoiding computationally expensive models.

Result: The method outperformed traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and achieved results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based approach is effective for topic labeling, balancing performance and efficiency. Future research should focus on improving interpretability and automation.

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

### [90] [SSPO: Subsentence-level Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04256)
*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSPO introduces a sentence-level importance ratio to balance the trade-offs of GRPO and GSPO, improving stability and data utilization in LLM training. It outperforms GRPO and GSPO with an average score of 46.57.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unstable policy updates in GRPO and low data utilization in GSPO, SSPO aims to balance both issues by optimizing at the sentence level.

Method: SSPO applies a sentence-level importance ratio and uses sentence entropy to adjust PPO-CLIP clipping bounds, encouraging exploration in high-entropy tokens and stability in low-entropy ones.

Result: SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, outperforming GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively leverages data by combining the strengths of GSPO while mitigating its drawbacks, demonstrating superior performance in LLM training.

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

*Mohammad Amin Ghanizadeh,Mohammad Javad Dousti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A data selection method improves machine translation efficiency by leveraging learnability scores and batch selection, achieving significant gains in data and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing machine translation performance through effective data quality and selection.

Method: Utilizes learnability scores and batch selection to optimize data relevance and interdependencies for fine-tuning.

Result: Fivefold improvement in data efficiency, 24% computational efficiency gain, and better translation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms random selection, demonstrating superior efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' temporal reasoning by testing their ability to answer 1940 trivia questions in English and Norwegian, finding English prompts yield better results. Larger models improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capability for temporal reasoning and language performance using historical trivia questions.

Method: Used a 1940 Norwegian trivia book to prompt LLMs in both English and Norwegian, with answers graded by LLM-as-judge and human checks. Tested multiple model families, including one specialized for Norwegian.

Result: English prompts outperformed Norwegian, and larger LLMs showed better results.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit stronger temporal reasoning in English, and model size positively impacts performance.

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PTTSD is a probabilistic framework for predicting depression severity from clinical interviews, offering uncertainty estimates and temporal modeling for better interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for depression severity prediction often lack uncertainty estimates and temporal modeling, which are crucial for clinical decision support.

Method: PTTSD combines bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, residual connections, and Gaussian or Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood, with sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants.

Result: PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance on E-DAIC and DAIC-WOZ datasets (MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated prediction intervals.

Conclusion: The framework's attention mechanisms and probabilistic modeling enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, as confirmed by ablation studies and comparisons with MentalBERT.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

TL;DR: ThaiOCRBench is the first benchmark evaluating VLMs on Thai text-rich visual tasks, highlighting performance gaps and challenges in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underrepresentation of Thai in VLMs, especially for document structure understanding.

Method: A diverse, human-annotated dataset of 2,808 samples across 13 tasks, evaluated in zero-shot settings.

Result: Proprietary models outperform open-source ones, with significant drops in fine-grained text and handwritten content tasks.

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench offers insights for improving Thai-language document understanding and standardizes VLM assessment for low-resource languages.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

TL;DR: RUST-BENCH is a new benchmark addressing the gap in tabular reasoning by evaluating LLMs on complex, real-world tables, revealing their weaknesses in handling heterogeneity and multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks use small, uniform tables, failing to represent real-world complexity, which limits understanding of LLMs' tabular reasoning abilities.

Method: RUST-BENCH introduces 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables across NSF grant records (RB-Science) and NBA statistics (RB-Sports), testing LLMs on scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity.

Result: LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop reasoning, highlighting shortcomings in current architectures and prompting strategies.

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH provides a challenging testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research by exposing LLMs to more realistic data complexity.

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the OUNLP system for readability-controlled text simplification using LLM-prompting, ranking 7th in the TSAR-2025 Shared Task. It introduces two GPT-4o-based multi-round methods and highlights the impact of the CEFR level gap on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the discovery that text simplification performance correlates with the gap between source and target CEFR levels, leading to the development of improved methods.

Method: Two multi-round simplification methods were proposed: rule-based (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based LLM (MRS-Joint), both generated using GPT-4o.

Result: The system ranked 7th out of 20 teams. Further improvements with MRS-Joint showed enhanced performance by using LLM-simplified candidates as starting points.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that leveraging LLM-simplified candidates in multi-round processes can significantly improve text simplification outcomes.

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

Motivation: Understanding personality-like behaviors in LLMs is crucial for responsible AI development and deployment.

Method: Systematic evaluation of six LLMs using the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework under varying sampling temperatures.

Result: Significant differences in four personality dimensions, with Neuroticism and Extraversion affected by temperature. Hierarchical clustering shows distinct model groups.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LLM personality traits, aiding model tuning, selection, and ethical AI governance. Data and code are shared openly.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGalyst is an automated, human-aligned framework for evaluating domain-specific RAG systems, featuring synthetic QA dataset generation and refined LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. It highlights the context-dependent nature of RAG performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for RAG systems lack domain-specific nuance and validated alignment with human judgment, necessitating a more rigorous approach.

Method: RAGalyst uses an agentic pipeline to generate synthetic QA datasets and refines LLM-as-a-Judge metrics (Answer Correctness and Answerability) through prompt optimization.

Result: Performance of RAG components varies by domain, with no universal optimal configuration. Analysis reveals common reasons for low Answer Correctness.

Conclusion: RAGalyst provides a systematic evaluation framework, enabling practitioners to make informed design choices for reliable RAG systems in specialized domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding
Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in
specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing
evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to
capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge
approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper
introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for
the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an
agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)
datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to
ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge
metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to
achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to
evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military
operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is
highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter
configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis
on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings
highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,
which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make
informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.

### [99] [Modeling Clinical Uncertainty in Radiology Reports: from Explicit Uncertainty Markers to Implicit Reasoning Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04506)
*Paloma Rabaey,Jong Hak Moon,Jung-Oh Lee,Min Gwan Kim,Hangyul Yoon,Thomas Demeester,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses uncertainty in radiology reports by distinguishing explicit and implicit types. It proposes a framework to quantify explicit uncertainty using LLM-based rankings and models implicit uncertainty via an expansion framework. The result is Lunguage++, an enriched benchmark for uncertainty-aware analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports often contain uncertainty, either explicit (hedging phrases) or implicit (omitted reasoning). This poses challenges for automated analysis, requiring better methods to quantify and model such uncertainty.

Method: A two-part framework: (1) quantify explicit uncertainty using expert-validated LLM-based rankings of hedging phrases, and (2) model implicit uncertainty by systematically adding sub-findings from diagnostic pathways.

Result: Lunguage++, an expanded and uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark, enabling uncertainty-aware image classification and diagnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework enhances structured radiology reports, facilitating better automated analysis and investigation into diagnostic uncertainty's clinical impact.

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how language models represent alternate reasoning paths during generation, using hidden activations to quantify and control uncertainty, showing a correlation between uncertainty and steerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how language models navigate reasoning paths and quantify uncertainty during text generation, particularly in chain-of-thought scenarios.

Method: Using hidden activations to control and predict model uncertainty, testing steerability and implicit representation of alternate paths.

Result: Found correlation between model uncertainty and steerability; hidden activations predict future outcome distributions, indicating implicit alternate path representation.

Conclusion: Activation interventions are most effective when models have alternate paths, suggesting they implicitly represent possible reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the analysis of argumentative essays by focusing on user experience and bridging the gap between structural semantics and human understanding.

Method: Structures essays into argumentation graphs with claims as nodes and evidence as properties, using LLMs to classify and score relations.

Result: Provides visualizations, justifications, and quantitative measures for essay coherence, enabling rapid exploration of argumentative quality.

Conclusion: IntelliProof successfully combines LLM-driven analysis with interactive visualization, offering a user-friendly tool for essay analysis.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural
language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative
essays and the user's understanding of a given text. A live demo and the system

### [102] [From Model to Breach: Towards Actionable LLM-Generated Vulnerabilities Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04538)
*Cyril Vallez,Alexander Sternfeld,Andrei Kucharavy,Ljiljana Dolamic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based coding assistants generate bugs impacting cybersecurity, with even latest models vulnerable to early reported issues. A new severity metric, Prompt Exposure (PE), and Model Exposure (ME) score are introduced to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing role of LLM-based coding assistants in software development raises concerns about the cybersecurity impact of the bugs they generate. Existing benchmarks and approaches haven't sufficiently improved security.

Method: The study evaluates LLM vulnerability in realistic settings and introduces PE, a severity metric considering vulnerability severity, generation chance, and prompt formulation. ME score is then defined to assess model vulnerability severity and prevalence.

Result: Findings show that even the latest open-weight LLMs remain vulnerable to early reported security scenarios, indicating a safety-functionality trade-off hindering effective patching.

Conclusion: The proposed PE and ME metrics aim to encourage mitigation of serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, addressing the unresolved security challenges in LLM-generated code.

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

Conclusion: RAG-based methods, especially Agentic RAG, enhance the reliability and accessibility of Bangla medical QA, paving the way for multilingual medical AI research.

Abstract: Developing accurate biomedical Question Answering (QA) systems in
low-resource languages remains a major challenge, limiting equitable access to
reliable medical knowledge. This paper introduces BanglaMedQA and
BanglaMMedBench, the first large-scale Bangla biomedical Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) datasets designed to evaluate reasoning and retrieval in medical
artificial intelligence (AI). The study applies and benchmarks several
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies, including Traditional,
Zero-Shot Fallback, Agentic, Iterative Feedback, and Aggregate RAG, combining
textbook-based and web retrieval with generative reasoning to improve factual
accuracy. A key novelty lies in integrating a Bangla medical textbook corpus
through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and implementing an Agentic RAG
pipeline that dynamically selects between retrieval and reasoning strategies.
Experimental results show that the Agentic RAG achieved the highest accuracy
89.54% with openai/gpt-oss-120b, outperforming other configurations and
demonstrating superior rationale quality. These findings highlight the
potential of RAG-based methods to enhance the reliability and accessibility of
Bangla medical QA, establishing a foundation for future research in
multilingual medical artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: DeReC, a lightweight fact verification system using dense retrieval and classification, outperforms LLM-based methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational inefficiency and hallucination risks in LLM-based fact verification systems.

Method: Combines dense retrieval with specialized classification for fact verification.

Result: 95% faster on RAWFC, 92% faster on LIAR-RAW; achieves 65.58% F1 score on RAWFC, surpassing L-Defense (61.20%).

Conclusion: Retrieval-based systems like DeReC can match or exceed LLM performance while being more practical.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally
efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC
dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art
method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered
retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized
tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces OptiMA, a transaction-based framework for designing complex multi-agent systems (VCMAS) to address faults and performance bottlenecks, demonstrating improvements exceeding 16% with scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of multi-agent systems leads to potential pitfalls like susceptibilities to faults and performance bottlenecks, which the study aims to mitigate.

Method: Proposes a transaction-based framework (VCMAS) and integrates transaction scheduling to address faults and performance issues, implemented in the OptiMA framework.

Result: OptiMA successfully facilitates execution of systems with over a hundred agents and shows up to 16% performance improvement with scheduling, alongside theoretical analysis and practical tools for scheduling.

Conclusion: The OptiMA framework effectively addresses complexity-induced challenges in multi-agent systems, offering scalable solutions and tools for future research.

Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

TL;DR: ASAP is a multi-agent system that automates performance optimization for distributed LLM training, reducing manual tuning and improving efficiency by up to 28% in training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for optimizing LLM training are slow and resource-intensive, failing to adapt to the rapidly evolving domain. ASAP aims to automate this process.

Method: ASAP uses Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents, integrating LLM reasoning with profiling tools, roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of past optimizations.

Result: ASAP achieved a 28% reduction in training step time and 1.43x throughput improvement, further boosted to 2.58x with human expert input.

Conclusion: ASAP offers a scalable, explainable solution for AI-assisted performance engineering in large-scale LLM training.

Abstract: Optimizing large-language model (LLM) training on distributed domain-specific
accelerator systems presents significant challenges due to its complex
optimization space. Existing optimization methods, however, rely on
time-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which
struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow
development and underutilized resources. To address this, we introduce ASAP, an
Agentic Solution to Auto-optimize Performance of Large-Scale LLM Training. It
is a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents,
which integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools,
roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past
optimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the
diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding
configurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of
distributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated
sharding configurations can contribute up to 28% training step time reduction
and 1.43 times throughput improvement. When combined with additional
optimization from human experts, throughput can be further increased to 2.58
times. The proposed ASAP promises to provide a scalable and explainable
methodology for AI-assisted performance engineering in large-scale LLM
training.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collaborative multi-agent framework for automatic question generation in math education to better control complexity and cognitive demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of controlling problem complexity and cognitive demands in automatic question generation using traditional transformer-based models.

Method: Proposes a collaborative multi-agent framework where agents iteratively refine question-answer pairs to balance complexity and cognitive demand.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show improved question quality, balancing cognitive challenge and clarity based on meta-evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: Collaborative multi-agent workflows enhance pedagogically valuable content generation, advancing adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation and code-intensive nature of existing LLM interpretability tools by providing a unified, accessible solution.

Method: Uses an orchestrator LLM to reformulate queries, an agent router to direct queries to specialized modules, and contextualizes outputs into coherent explanations.

Result: A consolidated, interactive chat-based interface for LLM interpretability with guided explanations and visualization.

further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

TL;DR: DreamGym is a unified framework synthesizing diverse experiences for scalable RL training of autonomous agents, outperforming baselines and reducing reliance on costly real-world interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable rewards, and infrastructure complexity hinder RL adoption for LLM agents. DreamGym aims to overcome these by providing scalable synthetic experience data.

Method: DreamGym uses a reasoning-based experience model for consistent state transitions and feedback, an experience replay buffer initialized with offline data, and adaptive task generation for curriculum learning.

Result: DreamGym improves RL training significantly, outperforming baselines by over 30% in non-RL-ready tasks and matching GRPO/PPO performance with synthetic data alone. It also enhances sim-to-real transfer with fewer real-world interactions.

Conclusion: DreamGym offers a scalable and effective solution for RL training, reducing dependency on costly real-world rollouts while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores tokenization models for assembly code, evaluating their intrinsic properties and impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization in assembly code is underexplored but crucial for NLP-based binary analysis. The study aims to evaluate NLP tokenization models and their customization for assembly code.

Method: The study analyzes tokenization models (e.g., Llama 3.2, BERT, BART) for assembly code, focusing on efficiency, vocabulary compression, and semantic fidelity. It includes intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.

Result: Tokenizer choice significantly impacts downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics offering partial predictability. Trade-offs exist between tokenizer properties and practical utility.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for optimizing tokenization in low-level code analysis, enhancing NLM-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

### [111] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's empowerment can reduce another's influence, termed disempowerment; joint empowerment mitigates this but affects user rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore empowerment-based assistance in multi-human settings, revealing misalignment of goal-agnostic objectives in multi-agent contexts.

Method: Introduces Disempower-Grid, a multi-human gridworld test suite, and empirically analyzes disempowerment and joint empowerment.

Result: Assistive agents focusing on one human's empowerment reduce another's influence; joint empowerment lessens disempowerment but lowers user rewards.

Conclusion: Goal-agnostic objectives may misalign in multi-agent settings, highlighting a challenge for AI alignment.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

TL;DR: BehaviorLens benchmarks MLLMs using text and image representations of user behavior, finding image formats boost prediction accuracy by 87.5% without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether textual or image representations of user behavior data are more effective for MLLM performance.

Method: Developed BehaviorLens, a framework testing six MLLMs with text paragraphs, scatter plots, and flowcharts representing transaction data.

Result: Image representations improved next-purchase prediction accuracy by 87.5% compared to text.

Conclusion: Visual representations of user behavior data significantly enhance MLLM performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can replicate human decision-making patterns in game-theoretic experiments, with models like Llama closely mimicking human cooperation and Qwen aligning with Nash equilibrium, enabling new research avenues in social sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how closely LLMs mirror human decision-making, as misalignment could lead to harmful outcomes in applications like health, education, and law, or render LLMs ineffective for simulations.

Method: Developed a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and a systematic prompting/probing framework to evaluate machine behavior using three open-source models (Llama, Mistral, Qwen).

Result: Llama replicated human cooperation patterns well, capturing deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligned with Nash equilibrium. Population-level replication was achieved without persona-based prompting.

Conclusion: Appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate human behavioral patterns and explore unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional social science research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

### [114] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the notion that Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) excels due to bidirectional relationships between knowledge components (KCs). Instead, it shows DKT's strength lies in modeling prerequisite (causal) relationships, supported by experiments pruning exercise graphs into DAGs and using DKT-learned representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the true mechanism behind DKT's effectiveness in knowledge tracing, questioning the widely accepted explanation of bidirectional KC relationships.

Method: Pruning exercise relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to test DKT's predictive capabilities on causal structures, and proposing a new method to extract exercise relation DAGs from DKT's learned representations.

Result: DKT's performance aligns strongly with causal structures, indicating it models prerequisite relationships between KCs, not bidirectional ones.

Conclusion: DKT's effectiveness is driven by its ability to approximate causal dependencies between KCs, offering new insights for explainable KT models.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [115] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show responsiveness to prompt language and cultural framing but remain biased toward values of dominant countries (Netherlands, Germany, US, Japan) despite efforts to steer their outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can represent diverse cultural values due to imbalances in their training data and optimization objectives.

Method: Tested 10 LLMs with 63 items from Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages and framed with/without cultural perspectives.

Result: Prompt language and cultural framing cause variation, but models still lean toward values of dominant countries. Alignment improves more with cultural framing than language.

Conclusion: LLMs are responsive to prompts but anchored to specific cultural defaults, limiting their ability to represent global cultural diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR. WELL is a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning that uses symbolic planning and a two-phase negotiation protocol to improve coordination and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of cooperative multi-agent planning with partial information and limited communication, focusing on overcoming coordination failures at the trajectory level.

Method: The framework introduces a two-phase negotiation protocol (role proposal and joint allocation) and symbolic planning, coupled with a shared world model for execution grounding.

Result: Experiments on block-push tasks demonstrate improved adaptability, task completion rates, and efficiency through negotiation and dynamic world model updates.

Conclusion: Symbolic planning and a neurosymbolic approach enable reusable, interpretable, and efficient multi-agent coordination, though it introduces a time overhead for strategy refinement.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world

### [117] [ArchPilot: A Proxy-Guided Multi-Agent Approach for Machine Learning Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03985)
*Zhuowen Yuan,Tao Liu,Yang Yang,Yang Wang,Feng Qi,Kaushik Rangadurai,Bo Li,Shuang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchPilot is a multi-agent system for efficient ML architecture search, reducing reliance on costly full training runs by using proxy-based evaluation and adaptive search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents in ML engineering suffer from high computational costs and slow iteration due to dependence on repeated full training runs.

Method: ArchPilot employs three agents: an orchestration agent using MCTS-inspired search, a generation agent for architecture creation, and an evaluation agent for proxy-based assessment.

Result: ArchPilot outperforms SOTA methods like AIDE and ML-Master on MLE-Bench, demonstrating efficient ML engineering.

Conclusion: The multi-agent collaboration in ArchPilot enables scalable and budget-friendly ML architecture search.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

*Divya Pathak,Harshit Kumar,Anuska Roy,Felix George,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study introduces anomaly detection for Multi-Agentic AI systems, curates datasets, and benchmarks methods achieving up to 98% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agentic AI systems, driven by LLMs, suffer from silent failures (drift, cycles, etc.) that are hard to detect, necessitating systematic anomaly detection.

Method: A dataset curation pipeline captures user behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation, creating benchmark datasets (4,275 and 894 trajectories). Supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) methods are tested.

Result: Supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) methods achieve accuracies of 98% and 96%, respectively, demonstrating comparable performance.

Conclusion: This work is the first systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, providing datasets, benchmarks, and insights for future research.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs internally represent and amplify numerical correlations, and how irrelevant context affects these representations, revealing vulnerabilities in their decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind numerical reasoning errors in LLMs, specifically how they integrate multiple numerical attributes and how irrelevant context perturbs these representations.

Method: Combines linear probing with partial correlation analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across LLMs of varying sizes.

Result: LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to amplify them; irrelevant context shifts magnitude representations, with downstream effects varying by model size.

Conclusion: The findings highlight vulnerabilities in LLM decision-making and suggest the need for representation-aware control to address multi-attribute entanglement.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

### [120] [Agentmandering: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Fair Redistricting via Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04076)
*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentmandering is a game-theoretic framework using LLM agents for redistricting, reducing partisan bias and variance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing redistricting methods lack strategic dynamics, allowing partisan manipulation despite legal compliance.

Method: Agentmandering employs turn-based negotiation between opposing agents using a Choose-and-Freeze protocol for constrained redistricting.

Result: Significant reduction in partisan bias and variance, especially in swing states, with improved fairness and stability.

Conclusion: Agentmandering effectively integrates strategic interaction into redistricting, ensuring fairer and more stable outcomes.

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-KGFR combines LLMs with KGFR for knowledge-intensive tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization and efficient large-scale graph handling via APP, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLMs' limitations in handling knowledge-intensive questions due to restricted context and parametric knowledge.

Method: Collaborative LLM-KGFR framework: KGFR encodes relations with LLM descriptions and uses APP for scalable retrieval.

Result: Achieves strong performance, scalability, and generalization without dataset-specific tuning.

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR offers a practical, scalable solution for KG-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing quality, combining psychometric techniques and statistical validation to measure simulation and evaluation quality. Empirical validation shows significant performance differences among platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice AI is scaling rapidly, but reliable testing methods are lacking, creating a measurement gap.

Method: The framework uses psychometric techniques (Elo ratings, bootstrap CIs, permutation tests) and statistical validation to benchmark testing platforms.

Result: Empirical evaluation of three platforms revealed Evalion outperformed others (0.92 evaluation quality vs. 0.73).

Conclusion: The framework provides essential metrics for validating voice AI testing platforms, aiding confident large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

*Alan Seroul,Théo Fagnoni,Inès Adnani,Dana O. Mohamed,Phillip Kingston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a probabilistic-normative model for assessing workflow quality and efficiency by combining rewards and penalties into a unified optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a mathematical framework for quantifying and optimizing workflow quality, integrating correctness, reliability, and cost.

Method: The method involves probabilistic modeling of workflow success (Opus Workflow Reward) and measurable penalties for structural and informational quality (Opus Workflow Normative Penalties).

Result: The framework enables automated assessment, ranking, and optimization of workflows, including integration into reinforcement learning systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a unified optimization approach for identifying optimal workflows under reward-penalty trade-offs.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

*Zhengru Fang,Yu Guo,Jingjing Wang,Yuang Zhang,Haonan An,Yinhai Wang,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent predictive coding framework minimizes mutual uncertainty for coordination, using self-supervised spatial coding and hierarchical reinforcement learning, achieving resilience to bandwidth constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of sharing consistent spatial memory in multi-agent systems despite partial observability and limited bandwidth, aiming to improve coordination.

Method: The framework employs a predictive coding approach with an information bottleneck objective, self-supervised spatial coding, and hierarchical reinforcement learning to develop efficient communication and social representations.

Result: On the Memory-Maze benchmark, the method maintains performance (64.4% success) under severe bandwidth constraints (4 bits/step), outperforming baselines (28.6%).

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled, biologically plausible basis for emergent social collective intelligence through predictive coding and efficient communication.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR suffers from RL overfitting due to policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting. RLoop, a self-improving framework, addresses this by iterative policy initialization, exploration, and expert dataset refinement, improving generalization by 9% accuracy and 15% pass@32.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of RL overfitting in RLVR, where models lose generalization despite gaining training rewards, motivates the need for a solution that preserves policy diversity and mitigates forgetting.

Method: RLoop introduces iterative policy initialization, exploring solution space with RL, filtering successful trajectories for expert datasets, and refining policies via Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT).

Result: RLoop improves generalization, increasing average accuracy by 9% and pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Conclusion: RLoop effectively mitigates forgetting and enhances generalization by converting transient policy variations into robust performance gains through iterative re-initialization.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in CUAs by addressing three gaps: scarcity of real-world tasks, lack of automated pipelines, and absence of unified benchmarks.

Method: The authors introduce an LLM-augmented pipeline for tasks like query sourcing, environment-template construction, and quality filtering. The dataset includes 1.2M action steps, screenshots, metadata, and reasoning traces.

Result: Benchmarking shows SOTA vision-language models have shortcomings in grounding and action prediction. Fine-tuning and RL improve performance but fall short of human-level reliability.

Conclusion: GUI-360° and its open release aim to advance research on robust desktop CUAs by providing a comprehensive dataset and benchmark suite.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Probe accuracy alone is unreliable for assessing Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) in explainable AI; a new method and metrics for concept alignment are introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of probe accuracy in representing concept alignment and the risk of capturing spurious correlations in CAVs.

Method: Proposes a novel concept localization method using spatial linear attribution and compares it to feature visualization techniques. Introduces three metrics (hard accuracy, segmentation scores, augmentation robustness) for quantitative assessment.

Result: Probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment improve concept alignment. Misaligned probes can achieve high accuracy, highlighting the need for better evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Alignment-based metrics and tailored probes are essential for accurately assessing CAVs, rather than relying solely on probe accuracy.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the medication safety capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical consultations, highlighting gaps in current research and introducing a benchmark, RxSafeBench, for systematic assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on LLM medication safety due to lack of real-world datasets and evaluation in realistic clinical settings. The study aims to address these gaps by creating a framework and benchmark.

Method: A framework simulates clinical consultations with embedded medication risks, generating inquiry diagnosis dialogues and constructing RxRisk DB (a medication safety database). A two-stage filtering strategy ensures quality, resulting in RxSafeBench (2,443 scenarios). LLMs are evaluated using structured multiple-choice questions.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with integrating contraindication and interaction knowledge, especially with implied risks. The benchmark provides a tool for assessing and improving LLM reliability in medication safety.

Conclusion: The study identifies challenges in LLM-based medication safety and proposes improvements via better prompting and task-specific tuning. RxSafeBench advances safer AI-driven clinical decision support.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework, extending the Generate-Verify paradigm by incorporating explicit monitoring based on metacognitive theories to address the prefix dominance trap and improve reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the prefix dominance trap in test-time reasoning architectures, where models often commit early to suboptimal paths and struggle to recover, leading to significant accuracy loss.

Method: The authors formalize metacognitive theories into computational specifications and propose the MGV framework, which adds explicit monitoring before generation and refines it through verification feedback.

Result: While no empirical validation is provided, the work offers a systematic computational translation of metacognitive theories and suggests architectural interventions for future reasoning designs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MGV provides a principled approach to understanding reasoning system failures and offers specific interventions to enhance future test-time reasoning architectures.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Iterative RMFT is a post-training method to improve LLMs' decision-making by fine-tuning on low-regret trajectories, enhancing performance across diverse models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with decision-making tasks, failing to achieve low regret or effective exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.

Method: Iterative RMFT repeatedly fine-tunes the model on its own lowest-regret decision trajectories, leveraging regret metrics for training signals.

Result: Improves DM performance across various LLMs, including Transformers and GPT-4o mini, generalizing across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT provides a principled, flexible framework to enhance LLMs' decision-making capabilities effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

### [132] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRPO's simplicity hurts with ordinal rewards, assigning positive advantage to failed trajectories. CoRPO introduces an adaptive baseline enforcing quality thresholds, ensuring failed solutions aren't reinforced and promoting optimal behavior. Validated on code verification, CoRPO shows stable convergence and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing RL training with richer, non-binary feedback by addressing GRPO's flaws when using ordinal rewards.

Method: Introducing CoRPO with an adaptive baseline enforcing minimum quality thresholds and transitioning to relative preference mode once thresholds are met.

Result: CoRPO demonstrates stable convergence and improved out-of-domain generalization in code verification tasks.

Conclusion: CoRPO represents progress in enabling LLMs to learn from richer feedback, advancing from binary to ordinal rewards and paving the way for denser supervision.

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

*Carnot Braun,Rafael O. Jarczewski,Gabriel U. Talasso,Leandro A. Villas,Allan M. de Souza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAVe combines classical routing algorithms with LLM-based semantic reasoning to personalize urban mobility routes, achieving 88% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional routing systems fail to integrate human drivers' dynamic contexts, prompting the need for personalized solutions.

Method: PAVe uses an LLM agent to evaluate routes from a multi-objective Dijkstra algorithm against user contexts via a geospatial POI cache.

Result: PAVe achieved 88% accuracy in route selections by incorporating complex user intent.

Conclusion: Integrating classical routing with LLM-based reasoning offers robust, adaptive solutions for urban mobility.

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

*Lars Krupp,Daniel Geißler,Vishal Banwari,Paul Lukowicz,Jakob Karolus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the sustainability issues of web agents, focusing on energy and CO2 costs, and highlights the need for energy-conscious evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web agents, such as OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are advancing LLM capabilities but raise unexplored sustainability concerns regarding energy and CO2 emissions.

Method: The study combines theoretical estimations and empirical benchmarking to assess the energy and CO2 costs of web agents.

Result: Findings reveal that design philosophies significantly affect energy usage, and higher energy consumption doesn't always yield better performance. Lack of transparency in agent parameters complicates energy estimation.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for incorporating energy consumption metrics in benchmarks to foster sustainable web agent development.

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

*Zihang Ding,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework optimizes sensor placement for urban flood monitoring with minimal sensors, achieving high-accuracy flow reconstruction and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban flooding is increasing, but high-resolution monitoring is resource-intensive. Efficient methods are needed for flood prediction under constraints.

Method: Integrated EPA-SWMM and DSS for sensor optimization, using singular value decomposition and QR factorization.

Result: Three sensors achieved NSE values of 0.92-0.95, with good robustness to uncertainty and sensor failures.

Conclusion: DSS enables efficient flood monitoring with minimal resources, suitable for early warning and real-time control.

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jr. AI Scientist is an advanced autonomous system that mimics a novice researcher's workflow, improves upon existing research, and produces scientifically valuable papers, outperforming fully automated systems but revealing key limitations and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific progress by understanding the capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems.

Method: Developed Jr. AI Scientist, which analyzes limitations, formulates hypotheses, validates them, and writes papers, leveraging modern coding agents for complex implementations.

Result: Jr. AI Scientist's papers received higher review scores than fully automated systems, but limitations and risks were identified.

Conclusion: While Jr. AI Scientist advances AI-driven research, its limitations highlight the need for cautious application and further research to mitigate risks.

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

### [137] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reframes ambiguity in natural language queries to tabular data as a cooperative interaction feature, distinguishing resolvable (cooperative) from unresolvable (uncooperative) queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in queries is traditionally seen as a problem; the paper redefines it as a shared responsibility between user and system.

Method: Develops a framework to classify queries as cooperative or uncooperative and evaluates 15 datasets using this framework.

Result: Current datasets inadequately mix query types, failing to properly assess system accuracy or interpretation capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework promotes embracing ambiguity resolution cooperation, guiding better design and evaluation of natural language interfaces for tabular data.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

### [138] [Question the Questions: Auditing Representation in Online Deliberative Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04588)
*Soham De,Lodewijk Gelauff,Ashish Goel,Smitha Milli,Ariel Procaccia,Alice Siu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an auditing framework based on justified representation (JR) to measure question representativeness in deliberative processes, comparing moderator-selected, algorithmically chosen, and LLM-generated questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of selecting a small, representative set of questions from many proposed by participants in deliberative processes motivates the need for an auditing framework.

Method: An auditing framework using JR is developed, with efficient algorithms ($O(mn\log n)$ runtime). Methods are applied to historical deliberations comparing moderator-chosen, integer linear programming-selected, and LLM-generated questions.

Result: Findings highlight the potential and current limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. The framework is integrated into a global online deliberation platform for practical use.

Conclusion: The framework enables practitioners to audit and improve representation in deliberative processes, with LLMs showing promise but requiring further development.

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT is a neuro-symbolic method that verifies Chain-of-Thought reasoning by formalizing steps into logic, improving trustworthiness in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of LLMs' self-verification in high-stakes scenarios by ensuring logical validity of reasoning steps.

Method: VeriCoT formalizes CoT reasoning into first-order logic and uses symbolic solvers and NL premises for verification.

Result: Effectively identifies flawed reasoning and predicts answer correctness on datasets like ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ.

Conclusion: VeriCoT enhances reasoning validity and accuracy through self-reflection, supervised fine-tuning, and preference fine-tuning.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

Result: High performance with RMSE of 2.74 and MAE of 3.46, validated over 1,757 weeks of data spanning 34 years.

Conclusion: The study improves grass growth forecasting reliability, aiding sustainable dairy farming practices.

Abstract: Grasslands, constituting the world's second-largest terrestrial carbon sink,
play a crucial role in biodiversity and the regulation of the carbon cycle.
Currently, the Irish dairy sector, a significant economic contributor, grapples
with challenges related to profitability and sustainability. Presently, grass
growth forecasting relies on impractical mechanistic models. In response, we

TL;DR: The paper introduces a federated learning framework for ECG classification using GAF images and CNNs, showing high accuracy and efficiency in IoT healthcare settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving ECG classification in IoT healthcare by keeping sensitive data local while leveraging federated learning.

Method: Transforms 1D ECG signals into 2D GAF images, uses CNNs for feature extraction, and validates the framework across heterogeneous IoT devices.

Result: Achieves 95.18% classification accuracy in multi-client setups, outperforming single-client baselines in accuracy and training time.

Conclusion: The FL-GAF model is a promising lightweight, privacy-preserving solution for scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

TL;DR: LOLGORITHM is a modular multi-agent system for generating stylistically diverse and contextually aware comments on short-video platforms, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comments are crucial for user engagement and content re-creation, but generating compliant and diverse comments is challenging.

Method: Uses a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with video segmentation, contextual analysis, and style-aware prompts for six comment styles.

Result: Achieves preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: LOLGORITHM offers a scalable, culturally adaptive framework to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

*Candace Ross,Florian Bordes,Adina Williams,Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Common-O, a benchmark to evaluate multimodal language models' reasoning across real-world scenes, revealing significant gaps between perception benchmarks and real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between strong perception benchmark performance and real-world reasoning, especially hallucinations in multimodal models.

Method: Developed Common-O, a benchmark with 10.5k novel images to probe reasoning by asking 'what's in common?' across scenes, avoiding web-trained data contamination.

Result: Best models score 35% on Common-O and only 1% on its complex version, showing hallucinations worsen with similar objects, suggesting reliance on training co-occurrence.

Conclusion: Scaling and multi-image training show promise. The benchmark is released to spur research into reducing hallucinations in scene reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

TL;DR: The paper addresses test-set leakage in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by proposing a detection method based on multi-modal semantic perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate inflated performance due to test-set leakage in VLMs, a concern arising from internet-scale pretraining corpora.

Method: Deliberately contaminates open-source VLMs on benchmarks, evaluates existing detection methods, and introduces a novel detection approach using multi-modal semantic perturbation.

Result: Existing methods fail or show inconsistency, while the proposed method effectively detects contamination by showing models' failure under controlled perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed detection method is robust and effective across various contamination strategies, with code and dataset to be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses decentralized multi-agent Stochastic Shortest Path (Dec-MASSP) problems, introduces linear function approximation, and provides the first regret lower bound of Ω(√K) for learning in this setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the gap in research on decentralized multi-agent learning in SSP problems, which is critical for applications like swarm robotics and traffic routing.

Method: The study employs linear function approximation and symmetry-based analysis to identify optimal policy structures and derive regret lower bounds.

Result: The key result is a regret lower bound of Ω(√K), demonstrating the inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the complexity of decentralized control learning and offer insights for designing efficient multi-agent learning algorithms.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP improves model utility by focusing differential privacy on sensitive features using foundation models for imputation and a modified DP-SGD algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DP-SGD applies privacy uniformly to all features, causing unnecessary noise and reduced utility, especially problematic when only some features are sensitive.

Method: FusionDP uses foundation models to impute sensitive features without accessing them during training and modifies DP-SGD to protect only sensitive features during model training.

Result: Tests on sepsis prediction and clinical note classification show FusionDP outperforms baselines in utility while maintaining strong privacy for sensitive features.

Conclusion: FusionDP effectively balances privacy and utility by leveraging foundation models and targeted differential privacy.

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

### [147] [Fair and Explainable Credit-Scoring under Concept Drift: Adaptive Explanation Frameworks for Evolving Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03807)
*Shivogo John*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive explanation frameworks for credit-scoring systems to address instability and unfairness in conventional methods like SHAP when concept drift occurs. It evaluates three adaptive SHAP variants, showing improved stability and fairness without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the limitations of static explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP) in dynamic environments, where evolving borrower behaviors and changing regulations can lead to unstable and unfair credit-scoring explanations.

Method: The paper integrates XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice reweighting, (B) drift-aware rebaselining with sliding windows, and (C) online surrogate calibration. These are benchmarked against static SHAP using performance, stability, and fairness metrics.

Result: Adaptive methods, especially rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, significantly enhance temporal stability and fairness across demographic groups, without reducing predictive accuracy. Robustness tests confirm their resilience under real-world drift.

Conclusion: Adaptive explainability is a viable solution for maintaining transparency, accountability, and ethical reliability in evolving credit systems, and is broadly applicable to domains with dynamic decision models.

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

*Bo Zhao,Berkcan Kapusuzoglu,Kartik Balasubramaniam,Sambit Sahu,Supriyo Chakraborty,Genta Indra Winata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a difficulty-aware routing method to assign problems to the smallest suitable reasoning model, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models are effective but costly to deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces.

Method: A routing approach using lightweight predictors of problem difficulty or model correctness to guide assignments across a pool of reasoning models.

Result: Routing improves efficiency over random assignment and matches the performance of larger models while using significantly less compute.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware routing is effective for cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

### [149] [One Size Does Not Fit All: Architecture-Aware Adaptive Batch Scheduling with DEBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03809)
*François Belias,Naser Ezzati-Jivan,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEBA, an adaptive batch scheduler, dynamically adjusts batch sizes using gradient and loss metrics, showing architecture-dependent training speedups (up to 62%) and accuracy gains (up to 7%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive batch size methods assume uniform effectiveness across architectures, but DEBA explores architecture-specific adaptation efficacy.

Method: DEBA monitors gradient variance, gradient norm, and loss variation to guide batch size adaptations, systematically tested across six architectures on CIFAR-10/100.

Result: Lightweight architectures achieve 45-62% speedup with 1-7% accuracy gains, while deep networks show variance. A gradient stability framework predicts adaptation benefits.

Conclusion: Adaptive batch scheduling is architecture-dependent; DEBA's design choices (e.g., sliding windows, cooldown periods) are critical for success, challenging one-size-fits-all assumptions.

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

*Ryien Hosseini,Filippo Simini,Venkatram Vishwanath,Rebecca Willett,Henry Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing Sketched Random Features to capture long-range dependencies, improving performance over baseline GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations like oversquashing, oversmoothing, and limited expressive power in GNNs.

Method: Injects randomized global embeddings (Sketched Random Features) into standard GNNs.

Result: Experimental results show consistent performance improvements on real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances GNNs and complements existing techniques.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

### [151] [From Static to Dynamic: Enhancing Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning via Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03828)
*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes StratDiff, a method using diffusion models and energy-based functions to smooth offline-to-online RL transitions by stratifying samples into offline-like and online-like subsets for tailored learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses distributional shifts in offline-to-online RL by leveraging the offline data's structure, a gap in current methods.

Method: Uses Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff) with diffusion models and energy-based functions to stratify samples and tailor learning strategies.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on D4RL benchmarks, showing better adaptability and stability.

Conclusion: StratDiff effectively bridges offline-to-online RL transitions by adapting learning strategies based on sample stratification.

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

### [152] [Higher-Order Causal Structure Learning with Additive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03831)
*James Enouen,Yujia Zheng,Ignavier Ng,Yan Liu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends causal additive models (CAM) to include higher-order interactions, introducing directed acyclic hypergraphs (hyper DAGs) for structure learning. It provides theoretical tools, identifiability results, and empirical advantages, including improved sample complexity, and proposes an extended greedy CAM algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of explicit treatment of higher-order interactions in causal discovery, which are common in real-world processes.

Method: The method involves extending CAM to include higher-order interactions, representing them with directed acyclic hypergraphs (hyper DAGs). Theoretical tools and identifiability results are provided, and an extended greedy CAM algorithm is developed.

Result: The results show that learning hyper DAGs can lead to better empirical outcomes, such as easier-to-learn structures under restrictive assumptions and improved finite sample complexity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that extending CAM to higher-order interactions using hyper DAGs is theoretically and empirically beneficial, offering a more comprehensive approach to causal structure learning.

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

### [153] [Enhancing Q-Value Updates in Deep Q-Learning via Successor-State Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03836)
*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADQ improves DQN by modeling successor-state distributions for stable, policy-aligned Q-value updates, outperforming DQN variants in stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQN's reliance on past policy-generated states introduces high variance in updates; SADQ addresses this by aligning updates with current policy.

Method: SADQ uses a stochastic transition model to integrate successor-state distributions into Q-value estimation and employs an efficient action selection strategy.

Result: SADQ provides unbiased value estimates with reduced variance, outperforming DQN variants in benchmarks and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: SADQ enhances DQN stability and learning efficiency by leveraging successor-state distributions and structured action selection.

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF) as a novel time-series problem, introduces benchmark datasets (arXiv and GitHub), and outlines domains with similar dynamics for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized datasets and unified treatment of LLF in time-series analysis, despite its prevalence in social and collaborative platforms.

Method: The authors present two high-volume datasets (arXiv and GitHub) and document their curation, cleaning, and verification of lead-lag dynamics using statistical and classification tests. They also benchmark parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression.

Result: The study confirms lead-lag dynamics in the datasets and provides benchmarks for future research, establishing LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm.

Conclusion: The paper lays an empirical foundation for systematic exploration of LLF in social and usage data, with open access to datasets and documentation.

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decomposition is effective for reducing deep networks without altering I/O. DecoHD applies this to hyperdimensional computing, achieving significant memory and energy savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decomposition methods in hyperdimensional computing (HDC) compress along the feature axis, which can degrade performance. DecoHD aims to compress learned class prototypes more effectively without losing robustness or concentration.

Method: DecoHD learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization using shared per-layer channels with multiplicative binding and bundling. It compresses along the class axis with a lightweight bundling head while preserving native HDC operations.

Result: DecoHD achieves extreme memory savings, stays within 0.1-0.15% accuracy of a non-reduced HDC baseline, is more robust to noise, and requires up to 97% fewer trainable parameters. It also delivers significant energy and speed gains over CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs.

Conclusion: DecoHD is a highly efficient approach for compressing HDC models, balancing memory savings with minimal accuracy trade-offs, and outperforming existing hardware implementations.

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x
over a baseline HDC ASIC.

*Ekin Uğurel,Cynthia Chen,Brian H. Y. Lee,Filipe Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to infer sociodemographic traits from mobility data using higher-order descriptors, diagnostic tools, and multitask learning, improving accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The weak and inconsistent relationships between mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, along with limited generalization, hinder effective use of passively collected datasets for transportation planning.

Method: The authors introduce behaviorally grounded higher-order mobility descriptors, diagnostic tools for uncertainty quantification, and a multitask learning framework for joint prediction.

Result: The proposed features outperform baselines in predicting sociodemographic attributes, and the multitask framework enhances generalization, especially with limited or varied data.

Conclusion: The study advances the use of mobility data for sociodemographic inference by addressing key challenges, offering practical tools for planners.

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of data scarcity due to high collection costs or privacy constraints by providing a method to evaluate and select high-quality synthetic datasets.

Method: Introduces SynQuE benchmarks and proxy metrics, including distribution and diversity-based measures adapted via embedding models and LENS, a novel proxy leveraging large language model reasoning.

Result: SynQuE proxies correlate with real task performance across tasks like sentiment analysis and Text2SQL, with LENS outperforming others on complex tasks. For example, it improved Text2SQL accuracy by 8.1%.

Conclusion: SynQuE is a practical framework for synthetic data selection under data scarcity, motivating future research on foundation model-based data characterization and fine-grained selection.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

### [159] [LogHD: Robust Compression of Hyperdimensional Classifiers via Logarithmic Class-Axis Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03938)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Pietro Mercati,Nathaniel D. Bastian,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogHD introduces a logarithmic class-axis reduction method for hyperdimensional computing, reducing memory from O(CD) to O(D log_k C) while maintaining accuracy and improving resilience and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard 'one prototype per class' design in hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is memory-intensive (O(CD)), limiting its suitability for constrained systems. Prior compaction methods focus on feature-axis reduction, which compromises robustness.

Method: LogHD replaces per-class prototypes with n≈⌈log_k C⌉ bundle hypervectors (alphabet size k), decoding in an n-dimensional activation space. It uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and integrates with feature-axis sparsification.

Result: LogHD achieves competitive accuracy with smaller models, higher resilience to bit flips, and superior efficiency. Under equal memory, it sustains accuracy at 2.5-3.0x higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression. ASIC implementation shows significant energy and speed gains.

Conclusion: LogHD effectively reduces memory and computational demands in HDC while enhancing robustness and efficiency, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC

### [161] [Conditional Score Learning for Quickest Change Detection in Markov Transition Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03953)
*Wuxia Chen,Taposh Banerjee,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a score-based method for quickest change detection in Markov processes with unknown transition kernels, avoiding explicit likelihood evaluation and using conditional scores derived from data pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to detect changes in Markov processes efficiently without needing explicit likelihood evaluation, especially in high-dimensional settings.

Method: The method involves learning conditional scores from sample pairs and developing a score-based CUSUM procedure with truncated statistics for bounded increments.

Result: The results include exponential bounds on mean time to false alarm and asymptotic bounds on detection delay, ensuring theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the practical feasibility and theoretical robustness of the score-based detection approach for high-dimensional Markov models.

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

*Mingliang Hou,Yinuo Wang,Teng Guo,Zitao Liu,Wenzhou Dou,Jiaqi Zheng,Renqiang Luo,Mi Tian,Weiqi Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm, hierarchical importance-guided forgetting (HIF), to address the challenge of data unlearning in cognitive diagnosis models, ensuring privacy while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis models due to privacy concerns and the 'right to be forgotten', a problem not adequately addressed by existing models or general-purpose unlearning algorithms.

Method: The proposed method, HIF, leverages the distinct layer-wise characteristics of parameter importance in CD models. It uses a smoothing mechanism combining individual and layer-level importance to precisely identify and unlearn specific data.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HIF outperforms baseline methods in terms of unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency.

Conclusion: HIF provides an effective solution for data unlearning in CD models, ensuring compliance with privacy requirements without compromising model performance.

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

Motivation: Understanding how higher-order optimization methods like SGN affect generalization in deep neural networks.

Method: Stochastic Gauss-Newton (SGN) with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch sampling, analyzed theoretically for convergence and generalization.

Result: Established finite-time convergence bounds and non-asymptotic generalization bounds, identifying a favorable regime for SGN.

Conclusion: SGN's generalization performance benefits from a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix, with theoretical insights on curvature, batch size, and overparameterization.

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PETRA is a novel transformer approach for predicting SARS-CoV-2 mutations using evolutionary trajectories from phylogenetic trees, outperforming baselines in recall metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2's rapid evolution challenges public health and vaccine development, requiring better predictive models.

Method: PETRA uses evolutionary trajectories from phylogenetic trees and a weighted training framework to address data imbalances.

Result: PETRA achieves 9.45% recall@1 for nucleotide mutations and 17.10% for spike amino-acid mutations, surpassing baselines.

Conclusion: PETRA effectively predicts SARS-CoV-2 mutations and aids real-time tracking of emerging variants.

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

*Yuxiao Wang,Di Wu,Feng Liu,Zhimin Qiu,Chenrui Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a composable fine-tuning method using graph structural priors and modular adapters to improve efficiency and stability in multi-task adaptation for large-scale pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high computational costs and structural instability in multi-task adaptation for large-scale pre-trained models.

Method: Integrates graph structural priors with modular adapters, using a relation matrix for task dependencies and low-rank mapping for adapter embedding.

Result: Enhances prediction accuracy, adapter weight allocation, and computational efficiency while maintaining lightweight design.

Conclusion: The synergy of graph priors and modular mechanisms proves effective for composable fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TwIST is a distributed training framework for sparsifying large language models efficiently, identifying high-quality subnetworks during training without post-processing, and achieving competitive perplexity at aggressive sparsity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient sparsification of large language models (LLMs) without post-training overhead, enabling deployable sparse models with practical inference benefits.

Method: TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in parallel, aggregates their parameters periodically, and resamples new subnetworks, identifying 'golden tickets' for sparsity.

Result: TwIST achieves 23.14 PPL at 50%+ sparsity, outperforming prior methods (e.g., 31.64 PPL), and produces structured, dense matrices for practical hardware use.

Conclusion: TwIST offers a training-time solution for deployable sparse LLMs, eliminating the need for post-training fine-tuning or recovery while improving efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large
language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

*Ahmed A. Metwally,Heyjun Park,Yue Wu,Tracey McLaughlin,Michael P. Snyder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and wearables, combined with machine learning, to better classify diabetes/prediabetes by dynamic metabolic phenotyping, enabling personalized interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static glucose thresholds fail to capture the heterogeneity of dysglycemia, driven by factors like insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction.

Method: Leverages CGM, wearable tech, and machine learning to analyze high-resolution glucose data and real-world lifestyle factors for dynamic phenotyping.

Result: Machine learning models accurately predict metabolic dysfunctions, and personalized interventions (diet, sleep, activity) are shown to be phenotype-dependent.

Conclusion: CGM and wearables enable precise classification and targeted interventions for dysglycemia, advancing precision diabetes prevention.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

TL;DR: A Ca²⁺-modulated learning framework, inspired by astrocytic signaling, enhances network anomaly detection by combining astrocyte dynamics simulation with a DNN, achieving high accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detectors are vulnerable to concept drift and new threats. This work seeks a biologically inspired solution for robust, adaptive detection.

Method: The framework integrates a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator (with IP₃-mediated Ca²⁺ release, SERCA pump uptake, and gap junction diffusion) with a DNN. Evaluated on CTU-13 network traffic data.

Result: The model achieved ~98% accuracy, reduced false positives/negatives, and negligible runtime overhead after Ca²⁺ precomputation.

Conclusion: The Ca²⁺-modulated framework provides an effective, biologically grounded solution for adaptive streaming detection tasks, extending beyond cybersecurity.

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for deploying LLMs on IoT devices using split computing and quantization to reduce memory and communication overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are impractical for IoT due to high resource demands; existing split computing methods don't address autoregressive inference challenges.

Method: Introduces one-point split compression (OPSC), a two-stage compression pipeline (TS and TAB-Q), and a unified optimization framework.

Result: Achieves 1.49x speedup, reduces communication overhead, and maintains or improves accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses LLM deployment challenges for IoT, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DartQuant introduces an efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method to reduce computational costs and overfitting in quantization, achieving significant speedup and memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization accelerates large-scale models, but rotational optimization methods are computationally expensive and prone to overfitting. DartQuant aims to address these issues.

Method: Proposes DartQuant, a method that constrains activation distributions post-rotation and introduces QR-Orth optimization for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 47× speedup and 10× memory savings on a 70B model, enabling rotational calibration on a single GPU.

Conclusion: DartQuant makes large model quantization feasible in resource-limited settings, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Conclusion: The ResNet-based model demonstrated strong performance in automated appendicitis detection, overcoming common pediatric imaging challenges.

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet

used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of the nnU-Net framework for automated segmentation of the left atrium from cardiac MRI, showing high accuracy and robustness compared to manual and traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of the left atrium is inefficient and impractical for large-scale clinical use, prompting the need for automated, accurate deep learning solutions.

Method: The nnU-Net framework was applied to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 dataset, adapting preprocessing and training automatically to MRI data.

Result: The model achieved a mean Dice score of 93.5, outperforming traditional methods and showing robust generalization across variations in image quality.

Conclusion: The nnU-Net framework is highly effective for left atrium segmentation, offering a practical solution for clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical
cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and
impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated
superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we
applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning
segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding
expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnU?Net model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the
atrial body and proximal pulmonary veins.

Conclusion: The data-driven approach provides a more effective and adaptable framework for filtered ANN search.

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

### [176] [DeNoise: Learning Robust Graph Representations for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04086)
*Qingfeng Chen,Haojin Zeng,Jingyi Jie,Shichao Zhang,Debo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeNoise is a robust unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection framework designed for contaminated training data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of contaminated training data in unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD), where existing GNN methods assume clean data.

Method: Proposes DeNoise, which jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, attribute decoder, and structure decoder via adversarial training. Includes an encoder anchor-alignment denoising mechanism and contrastive learning.

Result: DeNoise learns reliable graph-level representations under varying noise levels and outperforms UGAD baselines on eight real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DeNoise effectively handles contaminated training data and improves anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

*Hyungjong Na,Wonho Song,Seungyong Han,Donghyeon Jo,Sejin Myung,Hyungjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces KoTaP, a dataset focusing on Korean firms' tax avoidance and its links to various financial domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a standardized, long-term dataset for analyzing corporate tax avoidance in Korean firms and its connections to financial indicators.

Method: Constructed KoTaP using 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms, excluding specific outliers. Measured tax avoidance with CETR, GETR, and book-tax differences.

Result: KoTaP offers a balanced panel with standardized variables, aligning with international literature while capturing Korean institutional traits.

Conclusion: KoTaP is a valuable resource for research, policy evaluation, and applications like econometric modeling and AI analysis.

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

### [178] [Decomposable Neuro Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04124)
*Giorgio Morales,John W. Sheppard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decomposable symbolic regression method combining transformers, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming produces interpretable mathematical expressions while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression methods prioritize prediction error over identifying governing equations, leading to overly complex or inaccurate expressions.

Method: The method uses a Multi-Set Transformer to generate univariate symbolic skeletons, evaluates them with a GA, merges them via GP, and optimizes coefficients with a GA.

Result: The method achieves lower or comparable interpolation and extrapolation errors while consistently matching the original mathematical structure.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposable SR method effectively balances interpretability and accuracy, outperforming existing GP, neural SR, and hybrid approaches.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

### [179] [Exploring the Feasibility of End-to-End Large Language Model as a Compiler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04132)
*Hongbin Zhang,Shihao Gao,Yang Liu,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as end-to-end compilers, introducing CompilerEval to evaluate their capabilities. Results show LLMs have basic compiler abilities but low success rates, with improvements possible through prompting, scaling, and reasoning methods. The outlook for LLM-based compilers is optimistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can serve as end-to-end compilers, addressing gaps in current research and leveraging their potential for code transformation tasks.

Method: Developed the CompilerEval dataset and framework to evaluate LLMs' source code comprehension and assembly code generation. Analyzed errors and tested optimization strategies like prompt tuning, model scaling, and reasoning enhancements.

Result: LLMs demonstrated basic compiler capabilities but achieved low compilation success rates. Optimization methods significantly improved assembly code quality.

Conclusion: With targeted training, improved prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LLM-based compilers could revolutionize the compilation field, though current limitations exist.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

*Jiaming Zhang,Yujie Yang,Haoning Wang,Liping Zhang,Shengbo Eben Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPO is a framework for semi-infinite safe RL that optimizes policy performance while ensuring bounded safety by adaptively adjusting constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of enforcing safety across continuous parameter spaces in RL, ensuring adequate resource distribution or similar conditions.

Method: Uses iterative safe RL subproblems with finite constraints, adjusting active sets via expansion (for violations) and deletion (for zero Lagrange multipliers).

Result: EPO achieves near-optimal performance with strictly bounded global constraint violations under mild assumptions.

Conclusion: EPO effectively balances performance and safety in semi-infinite safe RL scenarios.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

*Olav Finne Praesteng Larsen,Massimiliano Ruocco,Michail Spitieris,Abdulmajid Murad,Martina Ragosta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transfer learning for generative models to address trajectory data scarcity in regional airports, achieving strong performance with minimal target data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secondary and regional airports lack sufficient trajectory data for machine learning and simulations, limiting ATM solutions.

Method: Adapted diffusion- and flow-matching models are pretrained on Zurich data and fine-tuned on Dublin data with varying amounts of local data.

Result: Diffusion-based models perform well with just 5% of Dublin data, reaching baseline levels at 20%, outperforming scratch-trained models.

Conclusion: Transfer learning can significantly reduce data requirements for synthetic trajectory generation in ATM, aiding data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based method for clinical risk classification using EHR data, addressing irregular temporal patterns and modality differences with improved accuracy and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in clinical risk classification caused by heterogeneous EHR data, such as irregular temporal patterns and complex semantic structures.

Method: Uses feature embedding for unified data representation, learnable temporal encoding, multi-head self-attention for dependency modeling, and semantic-weighted pooling for feature importance.

Result: Outperforms traditional and temporal deep learning models in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, enabling precise risk identification.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient and reliable framework for clinical decision-making with multi-source heterogeneous EHR data.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the benefits of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping in deep ensembles for better performance and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Investigates joint tuning of ensemble parameters and proposes a partially overlapping holdout strategy for practical implementation.

Result: Joint tuning generally matches or improves performance, with significant variation across tasks. The overlapping holdout strategy provides a practical compromise.

Conclusion: The study offers insights and guidance for optimizing deep ensemble models, with the overlapping holdout strategy being a practical solution.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ScaleDL is a novel framework for DNN runtime prediction, combining nonlinear layer-wise modeling with GNN-based cross-layer interaction, improving accuracy and reducing data costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN workloads demand accurate runtime prediction for resource optimization, but traditional methods lack accuracy, and graph-enhanced models increase data costs.

Method: Proposes ScaleDL, integrating nonlinear layer-wise modeling and GNN-based cross-layer interaction, along with the D-optimal method to cut data costs.

Result: ScaleDL outperforms baselines with 6x lower MRE and 5x lower RMSE in experiments on five DNN models.

Conclusion: ScaleDL balances accuracy, generalizability, and cost-effectiveness in DNN runtime prediction.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services,
supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving,
chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and
complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose
unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate
prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource
allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models,
limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced
modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection
costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance
between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To
address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction
framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network
(GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime
prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network
architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data
collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove
that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability,
achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates post-training quantization (PTQ) methods for LLMs under the MXFP4 format, identifies incompatibility issues with rotation-based approaches, and proposes a block rotation strategy to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs of large language models by exploring efficient deployment through PTQ, focusing on the new MXFP4 format.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking of PTQ methods under MXFP4, analysis of incompatibility issues, and proposal of a block rotation strategy.

Result: Found GPTQ performs well, while rotation-based methods conflict with MXFP4; proposed block rotation strategy improves accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for PTQ under MXFP4 and lays groundwork for future low-precision format research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) for transformer architectures, specifically targeting the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism. It proves the existence of SLTs in MHAs under certain conditions and extends the theory to transformers without normalization layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of theoretical understanding of SLTH in transformer architectures, particularly focusing on the MHA mechanism.

Method: The authors conduct a theoretical analysis to prove that randomly initialized MHAs with specific hidden dimensions contain SLTs capable of approximating arbitrary MHAs.

Result: The results show that SLTs exist in MHAs with high probability under certain conditions, and this theory extends to transformers without normalization layers.

Conclusion: The study concludes with empirical validation, demonstrating that approximation error decreases exponentially with increased hidden dimensions, supporting the theoretical claims.

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces seqme, a versatile Python library for evaluating computational methods in biological sequence design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified software library for assessing the performance of biological sequence design methods prompted the creation of seqme.

Method: seqme is a modular, open-source Python library offering model-agnostic metrics, including sequence-based, embedding-based, and property-based evaluations. It supports various biological sequences and provides diagnostic tools.

Result: seqme enables comprehensive evaluation of both one-shot and iterative design methods, with built-in visualization and diagnostic functions.

Conclusion: seqme fills a critical gap by providing a standardized tool for assessing biological sequence design methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

TL;DR: STELLE is a neuro-symbolic framework for time series classification that combines accuracy with interpretability by embedding temporal logic concepts into predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of interpretability in black-box deep learning methods for time series classification, especially critical in safety-sensitive applications.

Method: Introduces STELLE, using a novel STL-inspired kernel to map time series to temporal logic concepts, optimizing for both accuracy and interpretability. Provides local (STL conditions for predictions) and global (class-characterizing formulae) explanations.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy while delivering logically faithful explanations, validated on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: STELLE successfully unifies classification and explanation, offering a transparent and effective solution for time series analysis.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combines RLHF's scalability with PBO's query efficiency for active and sample-efficient preference learning, validated in high-dimensional tasks and LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human preference data collection is costly and time-consuming, necessitating more efficient learning paradigms.

Method: Integrate an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline to unify scalability and query efficiency.

Result: Consistent improvements in sample efficiency and performance in high-dimensional preference optimization and LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances scalability and sample efficiency for learning from human preferences.

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy risks in in-context learning by focusing on overlooked similarity search in LLM pipelines.

Method: Uses nearest neighbor retrieval with a privacy filter to track cumulative privacy costs.

Result: Superior performance in text classification and document QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method sets a new standard for privacy-aware in-context learning.

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for handling missing data in longitudinal clinical datasets fail to account for temporal relationships, limiting uncertainty quantification and model trustworthiness in critical settings like intensive care.

Method: The proposed method uses Gibbs sampling to treat missing values as unknown parameters with Gaussian distributions, enabling principled imputation and uncertainty estimation through iterative sampling of unobserved values.

Result: The Bayesian approach shows superior reconstruction accuracy and convergence compared to standard techniques like MICE, as demonstrated in simulated and real-world intensive care datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models enhances reliability and clinical relevance, supporting safer and more informed decision-making in healthcare settings with frequent missing data.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.

### [192] [The Illusion of Certainty: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs fails under ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04418)
*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs perform poorly on ambiguous data, despite working well on unambiguous tasks. New datasets (MAQA* and AmbigQA*) highlight this gap, revealing theoretical limits of existing estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in UQ methods for LLMs, which perform well on unambiguous tasks but fail on ambiguous data, motivating a need for improved approaches.

Method: Introduces MAQA* and AmbigQA*, ambiguous QA datasets with ground-truth answer distributions based on factual co-occurrence, and evaluates various UQ estimators (predictive distribution, internal representations, ensemble models).

Result: Existing UQ estimators degrade to near-random performance on ambiguous data, with predictive-distribution and ensemble-based methods showing fundamental limitations.

Conclusion: The study exposes a critical flaw in current UQ methods for LLMs, calling for reevaluation and new modeling paradigms to handle ambiguity.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

*Subeen Park,Joowang Kim,Hakyung Lee,Sunjae Yoo,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCER improves worst-group robustness by regularizing embeddings to reduce reliance on spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often fail in underrepresented groups due to spurious correlations, lacking theoretical grounding.

Method: SCER regularizes feature representations by suppressing spurious cues and focusing on core features.

Result: SCER outperforms prior methods in worst-group accuracy across vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: Embedding-level regularization effectively mitigates spurious correlations, enhancing worst-group performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SynthKGQA is a framework for generating synthetic Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets to improve benchmarking and training of KG retrievers, applied to Wikidata to create GTSQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval to improve factuality in LLMs.

Method: Developed SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic KGQA datasets from any Knowledge Graph, including ground-truth facts.

Result: Created GTSQA, a new dataset to test zero-shot generalization of KG retrievers, and benchmarked popular KG-augmented LLM solutions.

Conclusion: SynthKGQA enables better benchmarking and training of KG retrievers, demonstrating its utility with the GTSQA dataset.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular
solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

### [195] [On the Equivalence of Regression and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04422)
*Jayadeva,Naman Dwivedi,Hari Krishnan,N. M. Anoop Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a formal equivalence between regression and classification, showing that margin maximization in classification leads to a novel regression formulation. It introduces a 'regressability' measure to estimate dataset difficulty without model training and applies the equivalence to train neural networks for linearizing input spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between regression and classification, which traditionally lacked a formal link. They seek to justify margin maximization in regression and leverage this connection for practical applications like dataset analysis and neural network training.

Method: The paper demonstrates a one-to-one equivalence between a regression problem with M samples on a hyperplane and a linearly separable classification task with 2M samples. It uses margin maximization on the equivalent classification task to derive a new regression formulation and introduces a 'regressability' measure.

Result: The authors show that margin maximization in the equivalent classification task leads to a different regression formulation. They also develop a 'regressability' measure to estimate regression difficulty without model training and use the equivalence to train neural networks for linearizing input spaces.

Conclusion: The paper successfully links regression and classification through margin maximization, offering new insights and practical tools like the 'regressability' measure and neural network applications for linearization.

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

*Syeda Sitara Wishal Fatima,Afshin Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForecastGAN is a novel decomposition-based adversarial framework for multi-horizon time series forecasting, outperforming transformers in short-term predictions and integrating numerical and categorical features effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer models often underperform in short-term forecasting and ignore categorical features, prompting the need for a more adaptable and robust approach.

Method: ForecastGAN uses three modules: Decomposition (extracts trend and seasonality), Model Selection (chooses optimal neural networks), and Adversarial Training (enhances robustness via Conditional GAN).

Result: Validated on eleven benchmark datasets, ForecastGAN outperforms state-of-the-art transformers in short-term forecasting and remains competitive for long-term horizons.

Conclusion: ForecastGAN offers a generalizable, adaptive solution for time series forecasting without extensive hyperparameter tuning, maintaining strong performance across diverse data.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: The paper explores nonconvex-PL minimax optimization in federated learning under heavy-tailed noise, proposing two novel algorithms with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-tailed noise is more realistic than standard assumptions in optimization, and federated learning with minimax problems needs effective solutions.

Method: Two algorithms are introduced: Fed-NSGDA-M (normalized gradients) and FedMuon-DA (Muon optimizer for local updates).

Result: Both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{rac{s-1}{2s}}})$ under heavy-tailed noise.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms are the first federated minimax methods with theoretical guarantees for heavy-tailed noise, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new TNCM-VAE model combines VAE and causal models to generate financial time series with preserved causal relationships, improving counterfactual analysis and risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing market generators lack causal reasoning, which is crucial for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment in finance.

Method: The TNCM-VAE integrates variational autoencoders with structural causal models, enforcing causal constraints via directed acyclic graphs and using causal Wasserstein distance for training.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation, with L1 distances of 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth.

Conclusion: TNCM-VAE enables accurate financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories.

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

*Ipsita Ghosh,Ethan Nguyen,Christian Kümmerle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q3R is a novel low-rank training method inspired by IRLS, using a quadratic regularizer to maintain low-rank structure during pre-training, achieving comparable performance to dense models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-rank optimization methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks, necessitating a better approach to maintain low-rank structure and performance.

Method: Proposes Q3R, a quadratic reweighted rank regularizer, which majorizes a smoothed log determinant as a rank surrogate, enabling low-rank training with prescribed target ranks.

Result: Q3R achieves comparable predictive performance to dense models while truncating significant parameters (e.g., 60-80% in ViT-Tiny with minimal accuracy drops).

Conclusion: Q3R is effective for low-rank training across Transformers in image and language tasks, including fine-tuning, with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

*Alper Kalle,Theo Rudkiewicz,Mohamed-Oumar Ouerfelli,Mohamed Tamaazousti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-informed approach to compressing neural networks by minimizing errors in function space rather than weight space, achieving competitive accuracy without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the memory and compute footprint of trained neural networks through compression, focusing on tensorization and low-rank representations while minimizing performance degradation.

Method: Uses data-informed norms (minimizing the change in the layer's output distribution) and proposes new alternating least square algorithms for Tucker-2 and CPD tensor decompositions.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy without post-compression fine-tuning and shows the method's transferability across datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed covariance-based norm and decomposition algorithms effectively compress neural networks with minimal accuracy loss, even when the original training data is unavailable.

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand
considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its
memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we
focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.
Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing
an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use
data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we
minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed
as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is
the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,
$\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new
alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor
decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike
conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require
post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves
competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same
covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only
a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training
dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,
and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)
confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

*Shaolong Wu,James Blume,Geshi Yeung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses conflicts in algorithmic fairness concepts in criminal justice, proposing a modified group fairness approach that balances error rates and predictive accuracy while highlighting ethical considerations. It critiques current practices and offers a practical framework for deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in resolving unsettled fairness concepts in criminal justice, particularly the conflicts between group, individual, and process fairness, and improving algorithmic fairness practices.

Method: The authors propose a simple modification to standard group fairness by minimizing weighted error loss within a tolerance for false negative rate differences, aiming for easier solutions and higher accuracy.

Result: The proposed method simplifies fairness solutions, enhances predictive accuracy, and clarifies ethical cost choices, while addressing critiques like biased data and subgroup constraints.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a practical deployment framework emphasizing need-based decisions, transparency, and tailored solutions to link technical design with legitimacy in public decision systems.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

TL;DR: The paper explores linear mode connectivity (LMC) in deep learning, focusing on its role under data shifts and how parameters like learning rates and batch sizes affect convergence and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LMC interacts with data shifts and identify conditions to mitigate their impact, linking LMC to training stability, model similarity, and generalization.

Method: Experimental study of LMC under data shifts, analyzing the effects of learning rates and batch sizes on convergence and loss landscape smoothness.

Result: Small learning rates and large batch sizes reduce data shift impact, leading models to similar local minima. LMC balances efficiency with ensemble diversity benefits.

Conclusion: LMC mitigates data shift effects and optimizes training by balancing efficiency and ensemble diversity, with implications for model convergence and generalization.

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in
due course.

TL;DR: A comparison study shows the B-EPGP surrogate outperforms CN-FEM for solving the wave equation, achieving higher accuracy with matched degrees of freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of a boundary-constrained Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical finite element method (CN-FEM) for solving the 2D wave equation.

Method: B-EPGP uses exponential-polynomial bases to enforce PDE and boundary conditions exactly, combined with penalized least squares for coefficient estimation. A DoF matching protocol ensures fair comparison.

Result: B-EPGP consistently achieves lower space-time and maximum-in-time errors than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by about two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: B-EPGP is more accurate than CN-FEM for the given problem under matched degrees of freedom.

Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained
Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical
finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for
solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases
derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary
conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the
coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP
consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of
magnitude.

TL;DR: The paper extends a reinforcement learning-based method for training Koopman surrogate models in eNMPC applications, demonstrating scalability on a large-scale air separation unit case study with measurable plant variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show the scalability and effectiveness of their reinforcement learning-based method for Koopman surrogate models in challenging eNMPC applications, specifically large-scale industrial processes.

Method: The method uses reinforcement learning to train Koopman surrogate models for optimal performance in eNMPC, tested on a large-scale air separation unit case study with limited measurable variables.

Result: The method achieves economic performance similar to system identification-based Koopman eNMPC but avoids constraint violations.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning-based approach scales effectively to large-scale applications and outperforms traditional methods in constraint handling.

Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank
et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained
for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive
control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been
demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method
scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a
large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across
all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically
measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based
Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates
constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding
constraint violations.

TL;DR: A model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs using conformal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods for ROMs are often architecture- or training-specific, limiting flexibility and generalization.

Method: Introduces a post hoc, model-agnostic framework using conformal prediction to estimate statistical prediction intervals for latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions.

Result: The method accurately predicts droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty in a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides robust uncertainty quantification for ROMs without requiring modifications to the underlying architecture or training.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

*Divyansha Lachi,Mahmoud Mohammadi,Joe Meyer,Vinam Arora,Tom Palczewski,Eva L. Dyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a temporal subgraph sampler and Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP) to address limitations in existing graph models by integrating long-range spatial-temporal dependencies and supporting multi-task prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph models focus on spatial structure and single-task prediction, ignoring temporal dynamics and multi-task learning.

Method: Proposes a temporal subgraph sampler and RGP, a graph transformer with cross-attention-based latent bottlenecks and decoders for multi-task learning.

Result: RGP achieves state-of-the-art performance on RelBench, SALT, and CTU datasets.

Conclusion: RGP provides a scalable, general solution for relational deep learning with support for diverse tasks.

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

Motivation: Key species data, especially occurrence data, is often locked in non-machine-readable formats, making retrieval labor-intensive and slow.

Method: The ARETE R package leverages large language models (e.g., ChatGPT API) to automate data extraction, OCR, outlier detection, and tabular output, validated against human annotators.

Result: Testing on 100 spider species showed ARETE expanded known Extent of Occurrence by three orders of magnitude, revealing new conservation-relevant areas.

Conclusion: ARETE accelerates access to untapped occurrence data, optimizing resource use and enabling better conservation planning.

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

### [208] [Complexity as Advantage: A Regret-Based Perspective on Emergent Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04590)
*Oshri Naparstek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAA framework defines system complexity by predictive regret across observers, unifying emergent behavior notions and showing functional value in differentiated observer challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift complexity measurement from intrinsic properties to observer-dependent predictive regret, highlighting the functional advantage of differentiated complexity.

Method: Evaluates complexity by how much predictive regret a system induces for various observers, using simple dynamical models for demonstration.

Result: The framework unifies concepts like multiscale entropy and observer-dependent structure, showing systems are complex if they create varied observer challenges.

Conclusion: CAA provides a quantitative basis for why complexity is valuable, with implications for learning, evolution, and AI agents.

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

*Hampus Åström,Elin Anna Topp,Jacek Malec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transforming RL environments into goal-conditioned ones enables autonomous, reward-free task solving with comparable training times to externally guided RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable agents to autonomously select and solve tasks without external rewards by using goal-conditioned environments.

Method: Convert regular RL environments into goal-conditioned ones, allowing agents to self-select goals in an environment-agnostic manner, independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm.

Result: Average goal success rate improves and stabilizes, though individual goals may show instability. Agents can be instructed to seek any environment observations.

Conclusion: The method enables generic agent training for diverse tasks prior to specific applications, with promising performance.

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

### [210] [Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638)
*Satchel Grant,Simon Jerome Han,Alexa Tartaglini,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines whether causal interventions in mechanistic interpretability create out-of-distribution representations, distinguishing harmless from pernicious divergences and proposing a modified loss function to mitigate harmful effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if causal interventions in mechanistic interpretability produce representations that diverge from the target model's natural state, potentially compromising the faithfulness of explanations.

Method: Empirical demonstration of representation shifts, theoretical analysis of divergence types, and modification of the Counterfactual Latent loss to regularize interventions.

Result: Common interventions often cause divergences, including harmless (null-space or covariance-based) and pernicious (activating hidden pathways) types. The modified CL loss reduces harmful divergences.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the reliability of interpretability methods and suggests a path to improve them by mitigating pernicious divergences.

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores probabilistic forecasting for dynamical systems using PDEs, comparing methods like flow matching extensions and distillation techniques to reduce sampling steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve forecasting efficiency for dynamical systems, particularly focusing on reducing computational steps in methods like Navier-Stokes equations.

Method: The paper compares techniques such as direct distillation, progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs, and rectified flows, tested on challenging systems including 2D slices of 3D simulations.

Result: The experiments evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of these methods in reducing sampling steps and improving forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to advancing probabilistic forecasting techniques, with potential applications in efficient inflow generation for solvers.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the
number of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,
progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.

### [212] [Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647)
*Sitan Chen,Kevin Cong,Jerry Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes parallel sampling in diffusion language models (MDM) and provides exact bounds on divergence, connecting it to univariate function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limits of parallel sampling in diffusion language models without degrading performance, addressing gaps left by prior work.

Method: The authors provide a new exact characterization of divergence between true and sampled distributions, leveraging function approximation theory and deriving bounds based on information-theoretic properties.

Result: Novel bounds and sampling schedules are derived, showing potential for O(log n) steps without performance loss in certain settings.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of parallel sampling in MDMs, though optimal schedules require strong distribution knowledge.

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

*Xinlu Zhang,Yansha Deng,Toktam Mahmoodi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive model pruning to wireless time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed) to optimize pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation, reducing communication costs by 40% without compromising model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning (FL) faces challenges like stragglers and communication overhead due to limited wireless bandwidth and growing user devices. The study aims to address these issues by integrating model pruning into TT-Fed systems.

Method: The authors perform convergence analysis on the gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model with pruning, formulate a joint optimization problem for pruning ratio and bandwidth, and derive closed-form solutions using KKT conditions.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that adaptive model pruning reduces communication costs by 40% while maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive model pruning effectively optimizes TT-Fed systems, balancing communication efficiency and model accuracy.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

*Huaguan Chen,Wei Han,Haofei Sun,Ning Lin,Xingtao Song,Yunfan Yang,Jie Tian,Yang Liu,Ji-Rong Wen,Xiaoye Zhang,Xueshun Shen,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D nowcasting framework combining physics and data-driven methods for extreme precipitation forecasting, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack accuracy and speed for extreme precipitation nowcasting, missing vertical dynamics and suffering from errors.

Method: A hybrid 3D model processes volumetric radar data, using neural operators with physical constraints, stochastic terms, and residual learning.

Result: The framework excels in accuracy up to three-hour lead times and outperformed others in 57% of blind meteorologist evaluations.

Conclusion: The model successfully integrates 3D dynamics and physics, providing reliable and scalable extreme precipitation nowcasting.

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified theory of forgetting in learning algorithms, defining it as a lack of self-consistency in predictive distributions, and introduces a measure to quantify it. Empirical validation across diverse learning settings shows its impact on efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of a unified understanding of forgetting in learning algorithms, which hinders their ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new data.

Method: The authors propose a task- and algorithm-agnostic theory of forgetting, defining it as the loss of predictive information due to inconsistent predictions. They then devise experiments across classification, regression, generative modeling, and reinforcement learning to validate their measure of forgetting.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that forgetting is a widespread phenomenon in learning algorithms and significantly affects learning efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundational framework for analyzing and improving information retention in learning algorithms, offering insights into the dynamics of forgetting.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

*Julian D. Allagan,Dasia A. Singleton,Shanae N. Perry,Gabrielle C. Morgan,Essence A. Morgan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study assesses a 40-item math placement exam using Classical Test Theory, machine learning, and clustering, identifying strong discriminators, poor items needing replacement, and suggesting refinements for better placement accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize mathematics placement by evaluating exam items and student performance using a multi-method approach for evidence-based improvements.

Method: Combines Classical Test Theory (item discrimination analysis), machine learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), and unsupervised clustering (K-means) on data from 198 students.

Result: 55% of items show excellent discrimination; Question 6 is the strongest discriminator. Machine learning achieves high accuracy (97.5%), and clustering reveals a natural binary competency boundary (42.5%).

Conclusion: Multi-method integration supports refinements like replacing poor items, implementing a two-stage assessment, and combining machine learning predictions with transparency for optimized placement.

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.
