Classical results of Gold showed that\nlanguage identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any\ninteresting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise\ncharacterization of language collections for which this task is possible.\nMotivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language\ngeneration, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the\nsetting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of\n$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite\ntime, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.\n  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be\n$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's\ncharacterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This\nfurther leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language\ncollection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the\ncollection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which\ncan be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our\ncharacterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical\nsetting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution\nsupported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a\ncollection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be\n$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the\nother hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it\ncannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper revisits classic language identification in the limit, extending it to list-based identification where learners output k guesses.

This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and\nits future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework\nspecifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code\ncomprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed\nvarious errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and\nevaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently\nachieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the\nmodel, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code\ngenerated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we\nmaintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural\ndesigns and future research directions.
