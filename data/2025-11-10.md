### [1] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench is introduced as a large-scale benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in culturally diverse and multilingual settings, focusing on the Indian subcontinent with tasks like OCR, MMT, and VQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The benchmark addresses the lack of culturally diverse and multilingual evaluation for VLMs, which are often tested in Western-centric contexts.

Method: The benchmark includes ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across 13 culturally grounded topics in English and 10 Indian languages, covering 3 multimodal tasks (OCR, MMT, VQA). A parallel corpus of annotations is also released.

Result: Evaluation of 8 models shows significant performance gaps, highlighting VLMs' limitations in culturally diverse and multilingual settings.

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench provides a reproducible framework for inclusive multimodal research, emphasizing cultural diversity and multilinguality.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel anomaly detection method for identifying shape artifacts in synthetic medical images is introduced, showing high accuracy and reasonable agreement with human assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of using synthetic data (e.g., artifacts, distortions) in training machine learning models, ensuring clinical utility.

Method: A two-stage framework: (i) feature extraction using angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) isolation forest-based anomaly detection.

Result: High AUC values (0.97 and 0.91) and reasonable human agreement (66% and 68%) in detecting artifacts.

Conclusion: The method improves synthetic data quality by identifying and addressing specific issues, supporting responsible use.

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ControlNet++ enhances controllability in text-to-image generation by optimizing low-noise timesteps, but Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggles with uncertainty. Condition Preference Optimization (CPO) is proposed, focusing on control signals instead of images, reducing variance and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ and DPO have limitations in optimizing controllability and handling uncertainty. CPO aims to address these challenges by refining control signal preferences.

Method: CPO constructs winning and losing control signals (c^w and c^l) and trains the model to prefer c^w, eliminating confounding factors and reducing training variance.

Result: CPO outperforms ControlNet++ with significant improvements: 10% error reduction in segmentation, 70-80% in human pose, and 2-5% in edge/depth maps.

Conclusion: CPO provides a more efficient, low-variance solution for improving controllability in text-to-image generation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN introduces dynamic adaptive regularization for geospatial analysis, outperforming standard methods in accuracy, OOD generalization, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address heterogeneity in satellite imagery, requiring a more adaptive approach.

Method: DARN uses Task Complexity Predictor, Adaptive Dropout Modulation, and Dynamic Capacity Gating to dynamically adjust regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both full fine-tuning (86.66% mIoU) and efficient adaptation (90.5% mIoU).

Conclusion: DARN provides a robust, efficient solution for leveraging foundation models in geospatial applications.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

### [5] [Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds & Tropical Cyclones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04773)
*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework using machine learning transforms 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps to improve tropical cyclone forecasting, especially for intense storms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately forecasting tropical cyclones due to limited satellite observations and difficulties in resolving cloud properties during intensification.

Method: A pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline that learns from global satellite data to convert 2D imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant properties.

Result: The model successfully creates global 3D cloud maps and reconstructs the 3D structure of intense storms, even when observations are missing.

Conclusion: This framework advances understanding of TC intensification and enhances forecast accuracy by extending and supplementing satellite observations.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

### [6] [EETnet: a CNN for Gaze Detection and Tracking for Smart-Eyewear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04779)
*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet is a CNN designed for event-based eye tracking on resource-limited microcontrollers, leveraging sparse event data for efficiency. It includes training, evaluation, and quantization methods, offering both classification and regression models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based eye tracking solutions often require GPUs, limiting deployment on embedded devices. EETnet addresses this gap.

Method: Developed a convolutional neural network (EETnet) for sparse event data, with training, evaluation, and quantization workflows. Proposed classification and regression versions.

Result: EETnet enables efficient eye tracking on microcontrollers, validated via a public dataset.

Conclusion: EETnet bridges the gap between event-based eye tracking and embedded deployment, offering practical, low-power solutions.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [7] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, a faster and more efficient alternative to PointNet, using explicit geometric representations and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move from implicit representations (e.g., PointNet) to explicit geometric representations (e.g., 3D Gaussians) for better efficiency and performance in 3D recognition tasks.

Method: The method involves learning 3D Gaussian encoders using natural gradients and distillation from PointNets, along with applying computational geometry heuristics and filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: The results show the encoder runs 2.7 times faster than PointNet, uses 46% less memory, and reduces FLOPs by 88%. It also improves performance in Mamba3D, achieving a 1.27x speedup and significant reductions in memory and FLOPs.

Conclusion: The 3D Gaussian Point Encoder is a lightweight, efficient solution for 3D recognition tasks, suitable even for CPU-only devices.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study analyzes data redundancy and cross-domain transfer in biomedical image segmentation, finding that minimal annotated data can achieve performance saturation and selective replay mitigates catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored challenges of training data redundancy and cross-domain transfer impact in generalist biomedical image segmentation models like Cellpose.

Method: Proposes dataset quantization (DQ) for compact training subsets and evaluates cross-domain finetuning with selective replay and domain sequencing.

Result: Image segmentation performance saturates with 10% data; selective DQ replay restores source performance without hindering target adaptation; domain sequencing reduces forgetting.

Conclusion: Efficient biomedical image segmentation requires compact data subsets, retention-aware learning strategies, and informed domain sequencing.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available

### [9] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-centric AI workflow combining active learning and pseudo-labeling reduces manual annotation needs while maintaining competitive performance in biomedical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of traditional methods, nnU-Net's annotation dependency, and foundation models' underperformance on unique datasets.

Method: Proposes a workflow leveraging active learning and pseudo-labeling: pseudo-labels from a foundation model guide nnU-Net's self-configuration, followed by minimal manual annotation for fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly reduces manual annotation requirements while achieving competitive segmentation performance.

Conclusion: Provides an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques with minimized human intervention.

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/AL_BioMed_img_seg.

### [10] [Geometry Denoising with Preferred Normal Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04848)
*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new geometry denoising method using prior knowledge about surface normal vectors, solved via split Bregman (ADMM) and second-order shape calculus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve geometry denoising by leveraging prior knowledge of preferred normal vectors (label vectors) and embedding segmentation into the denoising process.

Method: Uses a set of label vectors for segmentation, regularizes with total variation, and solves the optimization problem with split Bregman (ADMM), updating vertices via second-order shape calculus.

Result: A robust denoising framework that simultaneously segments and denoises geometry based on normal vector similarity.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates segmentation and denoising, offering a novel approach to geometry processing.

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

### [11] [Self-Supervised Implicit Attention Priors for Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04864)
*Kyle Fogarty,Chenyue Cai,Jing Yang,Zhilin Guo,Cengiz Öztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An implicit self-prior approach using neural representation recovers high-quality surfaces from point clouds by leveraging learned geometric priors, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point clouds is challenging without strong geometric priors.

Method: The method uses a small dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field, trained via self-supervised reconstruction, and integrates results into RIMLS for surface extraction.

Result: The approach preserves fine details and outperforms classical and learning-based methods in robustness and fidelity.

Conclusion: The hybrid strategy effectively combines learned priors with input fidelity, achieving superior surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

### [12] [Clinical-ComBAT: a diffusion-weighted MRI harmonization method for clinical applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04871)
*Gabriel Girard,Manon Edde,Félix Dumais,Yoan David,Matthieu Dumont,Guillaume Theaud,Jean-Christophe Houde,Arnaud Boré,Maxime Descoteaux,Pierre-Marc Jodoin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clinical-ComBAT addresses limitations of ComBAT for DW-MRI harmonization in clinical settings by enabling independent site harmonization, non-linear modeling, and adaptability to small cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DW-MRI harmonization methods like ComBAT are constrained by linear assumptions and fixed requirements, limiting clinical applicability.

Method: Clinical-ComBAT introduces non-linear polynomial modeling, site-specific harmonization, adaptable variance priors, hyperparameter tuning, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

Result: The method improves diffusion metric alignment and normative modeling efficacy in both simulated and real data.

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT offers a flexible and effective solution for DW-MRI harmonization in diverse clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

### [13] [Validating Vision Transformers for Otoscopy: Performance and Data-Leakage Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04872)
*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (Swin v1/v2) initially outperformed ResNet in diagnosing ear diseases using otoscopic videos, but data leakage in preprocessing inflated results. After correction, performance dropped, emphasizing the need for rigorous data handling and a balance between model architecture and preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With a 27% misdiagnosis rate among specialists, improving diagnostic accuracy for ear diseases is critical. The study aims to compare vision transformers (Swin) with traditional CNNs (ResNet) in this context.

Method: The study used a real-world dataset of otoscopic videos, selecting frames via Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds. Swin v1/v2 and ResNet models were evaluated, initially showing high accuracy. Data leakage was later identified and mitigated.

Result: Initial accuracies were 100% (Swin v1), 99.1% (Swin v2), and 99.5% (ResNet). Post-correction for data leakage, accuracies dropped to 83% (Swin v1/v2) and 82% (ResNet).

Conclusion: Vision transformers show promise but require careful data handling. Balancing advanced architectures and preprocessing is key for reliable ML models in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

### [14] [Beta Distribution Learning for Reliable Roadway Crash Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04886)
*Ahmad Elallaf,Nathan Jacobs,Xinyue Ye,Mei Chen,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geospatial deep learning framework using satellite imagery improves fatal crash risk prediction by capturing spatial complexity and providing uncertainty-aware Beta distribution outputs, outperforming baselines by 17-23% in recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional traffic safety studies and neural network-based risk estimators, which overlook spatial complexity and lack model uncertainty awareness.

Method: A novel geospatial deep learning framework leveraging satellite imagery to model spatial patterns and environmental risk factors, estimating a Beta probability distribution for crash risk.

Result: The model achieves a 17-23% improvement in recall compared to baselines, with superior calibration and uncertainty-aware predictions.

Conclusion: This framework provides reliable, interpretable risk assessments, aiding safer autonomous navigation and scalable roadway safety planning.

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

### [15] [Learning to Restore Multi-Degraded Images via Ingredient Decoupling and Task-Aware Path Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04920)
*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Ying Zhang,Xichen Xu,Guannan Jiang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IMDNet, an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that decouples degradation ingredients for flexible path selection, achieving superior performance on both multi-degradation and single-degradation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting degradations, but most existing methods focus on single-degradation restoration, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: The authors design DIDBlock to decouple degradation ingredients, FBlock to integrate degradation information, and TABlock for dynamic path selection in the decoder.

Result: IMDNet shows superior performance on multi-degradation restoration and remains competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed IMDNet effectively addresses multi-degradation challenges and enhances restoration flexibility.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale multimodal dataset for AI in oral healthcare was introduced, containing dental checkups, images, radiographs, and textual records. Fine-tuned models outperformed baselines in anomaly classification and diagnostic report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for comprehensive datasets in AI-driven oral healthcare, enabling better benchmarking and model development.

Method: Collected 8775 dental checkups with multimodal data, fine-tuned Qwen-VL models, and evaluated performance on classification and report generation tasks.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed significant improvements over base models and GPT-4o, validating the dataset's utility.

Conclusion: The dataset is a valuable resource for advancing AI in dentistry, with publicly available data for future research.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future
research in AI dentistry.

### [17] [DeepForgeSeal: Latent Space-Driven Semi-Fragile Watermarking for Deepfake Detection Using Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04949)
*Tharindu Fernando,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework using Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) improves robustness and adaptability in deepfake watermarking, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of passive deepfake detectors and existing watermarking methods by balancing robustness and sensitivity.

Method: Develops a learnable watermark embedder in high-dimensional latent space using MAARL, simulating benign and malicious manipulations.

Result: Achieves over 4.5% improvement on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ benchmarks under challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptive solution for proactive deepfake detection.

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

### [18] [CLM: Removing the GPU Memory Barrier for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04951)
*Hexu Zhao,Xiwen Min,Xiaoteng Liu,Moonjun Gong,Yiming Li,Ang Li,Saining Xie,Jinyang Li,Aurojit Panda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLM enables 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to render large scenes on consumer GPUs by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory selectively, reducing overheads and maintaining high-quality output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling 3DGS to large scenes is hindered by high GPU memory demands, which CLM addresses by optimizing memory usage.

Method: CLM uses pipelining and exploits 3DGS memory access patterns to overlap GPU-CPU communication and computation, minimizing overheads.

Result: CLM successfully renders scenes with 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090, achieving top-tier reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: CLM effectively solves memory limitations in 3DGS, enabling large-scale scene rendering on consumer hardware without compromising quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

### [19] [Pattern-Aware Diffusion Synthesis of fMRI/dMRI with Tissue and Microstructural Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04963)
*Xiongri Shen,Jiaqi Wang,Yi Zhong,Zhenxi Song,Leilei Zhao,Yichen Wei,Lingyan Liang,Shuqiang Wang,Baiying Lei,Demao Deng,Zhiguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method, PDS, improves fMRI-dMRI synthesis by addressing signal differences and neuroanatomical pattern integration, achieving state-of-the-art results and strong clinical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing modalities in MRI hinder clinical use. Existing GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches struggle with fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to signal differences and inadequate neuroanatomical pattern integration.

Method: PDS introduces a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning and a tissue refinement network with microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity.

Result: The method achieves PSNR/SSIM scores of 29.83 dB/90.84% for fMRI and 30.00 dB/77.55% for dMRI, with strong clinical validation accuracy (67.92%-64.15% for NC vs. MCI vs. AD).

Conclusion: PDS significantly outperforms baselines in fMRI-dMRI synthesis, offering promising clinical applications for neurodegenerative disease studies.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

### [20] [Learning Fourier shapes to probe the geometric world of deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04970)
*Jian Wang,Yixing Yong,Haixia Bi,Lijun He,Fan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to study DNNs' geometric understanding, showing optimized shapes can act as semantic carriers, interpretability tools, and adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite DNNs' focus on texture, their geometric understanding is understudied. The research aims to bridge this gap by exploring how shapes alone can influence DNN perceptions.

Method: The authors use an end-to-end differentiable framework combining Fourier series for shape parameterization, a winding number-based mapping for pixel grid translation, and signal energy constraints for efficient optimization.

Result: Optimized shapes prove effective as semantic carriers, interpretability tools, and adversarial examples, demonstrating DNNs' geometric vulnerabilities and insights.

Conclusion: The framework advances the understanding of DNNs' geometric perception, offering new tools for interpretability and adversarial challenges.

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

### [21] [Challenges in 3D Data Synthesis for Training Neural Networks on Topological Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04972)
*Dylan Peek,Matthew P. Skerritt,Siddharth Pritam,Stephan Chalup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generate labeled 3D datasets for Topological Data Analysis (TDA) using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, enabling control over topological features. A neural network estimator is trained on this dataset to highlight challenges related to topological and geometric complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDA methods like persistent homology are computationally intensive, and there's a lack of labeled 3D datasets suitable for supervised learning in TDA tasks.

Method: The authors use the Repulsive Surface algorithm to systematically generate labeled 3D datasets with controlled topological invariants. A 3D convolutional transformer architecture is then trained on this dataset as a genus estimator.

Result: The trained estimator shows reduced accuracy as deformations increase, emphasizing the impact of both topological and geometric complexity on model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset addresses the gap in labeled 3D data for TDA and demonstrates the importance of considering geometric complexity alongside topological features when training generalized estimators.

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

TL;DR: This paper defines the Sticker Semantic Similarity task, introduces the Triple-S benchmark, and proposes the General Sticker Encoder (GSE) to improve sticker semantics understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stickers are widely used for visual communication, but their diverse and symbolic nature makes understanding their semantic relationships difficult. There’s a lack of standardized tools for this task.

Method: The authors introduce the Triple-S benchmark (905 annotated sticker pairs) and propose GSE, a lightweight model that learns robust sticker embeddings using Triple-S and additional datasets.

Result: Existing models struggle with nuanced sticker semantics, while GSE outperforms them on unseen stickers and downstream tasks like emotion classification and sticker retrieval.

Conclusion: The release of Triple-S and GSE provides standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, fostering future research in sticker understanding and multimodal content generation.

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are
available here.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights a bias in LVLM architectures favoring language due to appending visual embeddings to text. It proposes refining text embeddings with average-pooled visual features, improving visual grounding and reducing hallucinations, while suggesting advanced fusion methods for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent bias in LVLM architectures toward language modality caused by simple visual embedding appendage, which weakens visual grounding and increases hallucinations.

Method: Proposes refining textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features, offering a simple yet effective solution.

Result: Demonstrates improved visual grounding and significant reduction in hallucinations on established benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study reveals modality imbalance's impact on hallucinations and shows refining text with visual info mitigates it, leaving advanced fusion methods for future exploration.

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

TL;DR: Proposed DRE-SLCL method dynamically encodes WSI features using a memory bank and contrastive learning for cancer-related tasks, addressing GPU limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in training end-to-end WSI models due to gigapixel slides' tile count and GPU constraints.

Method: Dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) uses a memory bank and random tile sampling.

Result: Effective performance in cancer subtyping, recognition, and mutation prediction tasks.

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL successfully tackles WSI representation challenges, proving its utility in cancer analysis.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

TL;DR: Pressure2Motion synthesizes human motion from ground pressure sequences and text prompts, eliminating the need for specialized equipment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The method addresses the challenge of motion capture in privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost scenarios by leveraging pressure data and text prompts.

Method: The model uses a dual-level feature extractor and hierarchical diffusion model to interpret pressure data and generate motion guided by text.

Result: Experiments show the method produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motions, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark (MPL).

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion is a pioneering approach combining pressure data and linguistic priors for motion generation, with publicly available codes and benchmarks.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

TL;DR: NTP-MRISeg reformulates medical referring image segmentation as an autoregressive next-token prediction task, simplifying model design and improving performance with novel strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent MRIS approaches involve complex multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders, prompting the need for a streamlined, unified solution.

Method: Proposes NTP-MRISeg, a framework using autoregressive next-token prediction over unified multimodal sequences, with strategies like Next-k Token Prediction, Token-level Contrastive Learning, and Hard Error Token optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets.

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg offers a simpler, effective alternative to traditional MRIS pipelines, leveraging pretrained tokenizers and novel training strategies.

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

*Mingyu Sung,Hyeonmin Choe,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PITTA, a novel TTA framework for monocular depth estimation (MDE), addressing challenges in diverse environments with pose-agnostic adaptation and instance-aware masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods for MDE struggle in dynamic environments, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: PITTA uses pose-agnostic TTA and instance-aware masking, leveraging segmentation masks and edge extraction to improve adaptability.

Result: PITTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets, showing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: PITTA provides a robust and effective solution for TTA in MDE, enhancing adaptability to diverse and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

*Yuanxiang Huangfu,Chaochao Wang,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP enhances CLIP model training by generating semantically diverse captions using role-playing prompts, improving performance with fewer data pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data methods focus on volume, leading to limited semantic diversity and redundant captions. Role-SynthCLIP addresses this by diversifying captions.

Method: The framework uses multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., compositional analyst) with MLLMs to generate diverse captions, improving image-text alignment.

Result: A CLIP-B/16 model trained on Role-SynthCLIP's 1M pairs achieved 64.1% Recall@1 on MS COCO, outperforming baselines trained on 5M pairs by 2.8%.

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP effectively boosts semantic diversity and performance in CLIP models with fewer synthetic pairs, demonstrating its efficiency and superiority.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns over data privacy necessitate alternatives to real-world images for training Re-ID models, but existing virtual datasets suffer from complex construction and poor domain generalization.

Method: DPPP involves two stages: generating diverse virtual data (GenePerson) via prompts and learning domain-invariant features using Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) with contrastive learning.

Result: Models trained on GenePerson with PDM outperform those using real and virtual Re-ID datasets, demonstrating superior generalization.

Conclusion: DPPP effectively addresses privacy and domain generalization challenges, offering a viable solution for Re-ID model training.

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

*Fuyang Liu,Jiaqi Xu,Xiaowei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-level reinforcement learning framework is proposed to improve visual perception in adverse weather by using a high-fidelity dataset and adaptive restoration models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models trained on synthetic data struggle with real-world weather degradations, necessitating a more adaptive and physics-driven approach.

Method: Constructs a high-fidelity dataset (HFLS-Weather) and employs a dual-level reinforcement learning framework for cold-start training, with local-level refinement and global-level orchestration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse adverse weather scenarios by enabling continuous adaptation to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the limitations of fixed-parameter models and demonstrates superior generalization to complex weather degradations.

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

### [31] [Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Retinal OCT Images: A UK Biobank Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05106)
*Yasemin Turkan,F. Boray Tek,M. Serdar Nazlı,Öykü Eren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores deep learning for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection using raw OCT B-scan images, achieving modest results but identifying potential retinal biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of early AD detection by leveraging OCT B-scan images and deep learning, surpassing traditional segmented layer thickness approaches.

Method: Fine-tuned pretrained models (e.g., ResNet-34, RETFound transformer) using UK Biobank data with subject-level cross-validation, OCT-specific augmentations, and a year-weighted loss function.

Result: ResNet-34 achieved an AUC of 0.62, with explainability analyses revealing structural differences in the central macular subfield between AD and control groups.

Conclusion: This work establishes a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, emphasizing the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches to improve early detection.

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for lane detection in snow by using roadside delineators as indirect markers, validated with a new synthetic dataset, SnowyLane.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lane markings are often absent or occluded in snow, necessitating an alternative approach for reliable lane detection.

Method: Detects roadside delineators and models lane trajectories using Bezier curves, leveraging spatial consistency and road geometry.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art lane detection systems in heavy snow occlusion.

Conclusion: Provides a robust solution for winter scenarios and a valuable dataset for future all-weather autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: JWTH, a pathology foundation model, leverages cell-level morphology and self-supervised pretraining to outperform prior models in AI-based biomarker detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) focus on global patch-level embeddings and ignore cell-level morphology, limiting their accuracy and interpretability in biomarker detection.

Method: JWTH combines large-scale self-supervised pretraining with cell-centric post-tuning and attention pooling to integrate local and global token features.

Result: JWTH achieves up to 8.3% higher balanced accuracy and a 1.2% average improvement over previous PFMs across four biomarkers and eight cohorts.

Conclusion: JWTH advances interpretable and robust AI-based biomarker detection by effectively combining cell-level and global features in digital pathology.

Abstract: AI-based biomarkers can infer molecular features directly from hematoxylin &
eosin (H&E) slides, yet most pathology foundation models (PFMs) rely on global
patch-level embeddings and overlook cell-level morphology. We present a PFM
model, JWTH (Joint-Weighted Token Hierarchy), which integrates large-scale
self-supervised pretraining with cell-centric post-tuning and attention pooling
to fuse local and global tokens. Across four tasks involving four biomarkers
and eight cohorts, JWTH achieves up to 8.3% higher balanced accuracy and 1.2%
average improvement over prior PFMs, advancing interpretable and robust
AI-based biomarker detection in digital pathology.

### [34] [Splatography: Sparse multi-view dynamic Gaussian Splatting for filmmaking challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05152)
*Adrian Azzarelli,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,David R Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for dynamic 3-D reconstruction using deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) improves results for sparse camera setups by splitting foreground and background components and training them separately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Filmmaking often uses sparse camera setups, which limits current methods in capturing complex dynamic features.

Method: Foreground and background components are split using sparse masks at t=0, trained separately with different loss functions, and modeled with different parameters during dynamic training.

Result: Produces state-of-the-art results, achieving up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size, and segmented dynamic reconstructions without dense mask supervision.

Conclusion: The method enhances dynamic 3-D reconstruction for sparse camera setups, outperforming current techniques qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

### [35] [Another BRIXEL in the Wall: Towards Cheaper Dense Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05168)
*Alexander Lappe,Martin A. Giese*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIXEL is a knowledge distillation method that improves DINOv3's dense feature maps at lower computational cost by replicating high-resolution outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution feature maps in DINOv3 demand excessive compute; BRIXEL aims to reduce this cost while maintaining performance.

Method: BRIXEL uses knowledge distillation to teach a student model to replicate high-resolution feature maps from its own outputs.

Result: BRIXEL outperforms DINOv3 at fixed resolution and matches teacher model results with lower compute.

Conclusion: BRIXEL offers a computationally efficient solution for high-quality dense feature extraction.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE is a self-supervised learning method for nucleus detection and classification, addressing challenges in histopathology analysis by leveraging unlabeled data and multi-scale self-distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for nucleus detection and classification rely on labor-intensive annotations and fail to utilize large-scale unlabeled data effectively.

Method: MUSE introduces NuLo, a nucleus-based local self-distillation mechanism, and combines it with an encoder-decoder architecture and semi-supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show MUSE outperforms state-of-the-art supervised baselines and generic pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: MUSE effectively addresses challenges in histopathological nucleus detection and classification by leveraging self-supervised learning and cross-scale alignment.

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

TL;DR: WtL2 extends the original WtL algorithm for detailed segmentation of IR ships and RGB objects, replacing NMS with contour tracking for refined results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt the original WtL algorithm for broader applications, including IR ship segmentation and diverse RGB objects, improving detail and accuracy.

Method: Enhances WtL by refining object contours through contour tracking, adapting inputs for IR, and processing RGB objects to achieve closed, segmentable contours.

Result: WtL2 outperforms contemporary contour-based methods, achieving high IoU with detailed segmentation, suitable for specialized applications.

Conclusion: WtL2 is a versatile and effective method for detailed segmentation in niche image segmentation areas, offering high-quality results.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

*Jiang Lin,Xinyu Chen,Song Wu,Zhiqiu Zhang,Jizhi Zhang,Ye Wang,Qiang Tang,Qian Wang,Jian Yang,Zili Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeControl is a training-free framework for controlling semantic and spatial structures in diffusion models, offering efficient structural guidance without inversion or retraining, while supporting compositional control with minimal additional cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet and inversion-based approaches have limitations in flexibility, generalization, and high inference costs. FreeControl addresses these challenges to improve semantic and structural control in diffusion models.

Method: FreeControl performs one-step attention extraction from an optimally chosen key timestep and reuses it throughout denoising, coupled with Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD) to improve quality and stability.

Result: The framework enables structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation with approximately 5% additional cost, supporting intuitive compositional design.

Conclusion: FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control in diffusion models, balancing efficiency, flexibility, and alignment without requiring retraining or inversion.

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D3R is a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework that decouples static and dynamic components, achieving improved PSNR and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of novel view synthesis from dynamic scenes with unknown camera poses, especially where existing methods struggle with dynamic content.

Method: Uses a two-stage approach: initial pose/geometry estimation with 3D foundational models, followed by motion-aware refinement. Key innovations include MA-BA module for camera pose refinement and MA-GS for efficient dynamic motion modeling.

Result: Achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods and reduces computational requirements by 5x.

Conclusion: 4D3R significantly advances dynamic scene rendering by combining accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

### [40] [ADPretrain: Advancing Industrial Anomaly Detection via Anomaly Representation Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05245)
*Xincheng Yao,Yan Luo,Zefeng Qian,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for anomaly detection (AD) representation learning, addressing limitations of ImageNet-pretrained features by focusing on discrepancies between normal and abnormal data using specialized losses and a large-scale AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AD methods rely on suboptimal ImageNet-pretrained features due to mismatched pretraining goals and distribution shifts between natural and industrial images. The paper aims to develop specialized pretrained representations for AD tasks.

Method: Proposes angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to enhance feature differences between normal and abnormal data. Pretraining is performed on the RealIAD dataset to avoid distribution shifts, using class-generalizable residual features.

Result: Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and backbones demonstrate superior performance of the proposed pretrained features compared to traditional ImageNet-pretrained ones.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing pretrained features for AD tasks, offering robust and discriminative representations.

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an online skeleton-based motion recognition system using SPD matrices and Siamese networks for continuous detection and classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in online motion recognition, as most existing skeleton-based approaches focus on segment-based recognition unsuitable for real-time scenarios.

Method: Combines a detector and classifier using Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrices and a Siamese network for statistical representation and semantic similarity learning.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy in experiments on hand gesture and body action benchmarks, often surpassing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The system is effective for continuous online motion recognition, demonstrating flexibility and high accuracy.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate intraoperative delineation of CRLM is challenging due to low contrast and noise in iUS. Automated segmentation can enhance precision and efficiency in surgical workflows.

Method: A 3D U-Net, trained on cropped regions around tumors in iUS volumes from 85 patients, was compared to a full-volume model. Metrics like DSC, HDist., and RVD were used for evaluation.

Result: The cropped-volume model achieved significantly better performance (AUC-ROC = 0.898) with median DSC = 0.74 and faster execution (~1 min). Prospective testing confirmed robust accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.

Conclusion: The cropped 3D U-Net provides reliable, near real-time segmentation of CRLM, reducing manual workload and procedure time while maintaining expert-level accuracy.

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within

Motivation: To build agentic multimodal models that actively use tools (e.g., code execution, web search) and integrate them into reasoning.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline: cold-start for tool-use patterns and reinforcement learning for refinement. Dataset curation focuses on examples where tool use is beneficial.

Result: DeepEyesV2 performs well on RealX-Bench, excelling in real-world understanding, math reasoning, and search tasks, with adaptive tool invocation.

Conclusion: The study offers guidance for developing agentic multimodal models, emphasizing robust tool-use and real-world reasoning.

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

### [45] [What's on Your Plate? Inferring Chinese Cuisine Intake from Wearable IMUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05292)
*Jiaxi Yin,Pengcheng Wang,Han Ding,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuiseSense integrates smartwatch and smart glasses data to classify diverse Chinese foods, achieving high accuracy with a two-stage detection pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional food tracking methods have bias or privacy issues, and existing wearables focus on limited food types, not diverse Chinese cuisine.

Method: Uses hand motions from a smartwatch and head dynamics from smart glasses, filtering non-eating activities with a two-stage pipeline.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in detecting eating states and classifying 11 food categories using 27.5 hours of IMU data.

Conclusion: CuisineSense offers a practical, unobtrusive wearable solution for diverse dietary monitoring with publicly available code.

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online Video-LLMs struggle with continuous frame-by-frame inputs and optimal response timing, compromising real-time performance and coherence.

Method: LiveStar introduces incremental video-language alignment, a response-silence decoding framework, and memory-aware acceleration with streaming key-value cache.

Result: LiveStar achieves a 19.5% improvement in semantic correctness, 18.1% reduced timing difference, and 12.0% higher FPS compared to existing models.

Conclusion: LiveStar outperforms state-of-the-art online Video-LLMs and introduces the OmniStar dataset for benchmarking.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

*Matteo Bastico,David Ryckelynck,Laurent Corté,Yannick Tillier,Etienne Decencière*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques existing metrics for evaluating generated point clouds, introduces improved metrics (DCD and SNC), and proposes a new transformer-based model, Diffusion Point Transformer, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating generated point clouds lack robustness and fail to capture geometric fidelity and local shape consistency, prompting the need for better evaluation methods and a high-fidelity generative model.

Method: The authors propose two improved metrics (Density-Aware Chamfer Distance and Surface Normal Concordance) and introduce a new transformer-based architecture, Diffusion Point Transformer, leveraging serialized patch attention.

Result: Experiments on ShapeNet show that the proposed model outperforms previous solutions, achieving state-of-the-art quality in generated point clouds.

Conclusion: The combined use of improved metrics and the Diffusion Point Transformer provides a more comprehensive evaluation and higher-quality generation of 3D point clouds.

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sentence-to-Image Steganography, a novel task for hiding sentence-level messages in images, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to embed rich semantic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steganography struggles with embedding semantically rich, sentence-level information, which is increasingly important in the AIGC era.

Method: The authors propose $’S^2LM’$, a Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which uses LLMs to embed high-level textual information into images through a newly designed pipeline.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show the method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic capabilities for LLMs.

Conclusion: The work advances semantic steganography, showcasing the potential of LLMs in embedding rich textual content into images.

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

*Manuel Gomes,Bogdan Raducanu,Miguel Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Artic4D, a new dataset for 4D panoptic segmentation of articulated objects, and proposes CanonSeg4D, a framework that improves segmentation accuracy by mapping object parts to a canonical space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics in articulated object perception, and there is no benchmark dataset for 4D panoptic segmentation in this field.

Method: The authors introduce Artic4D, a dataset with 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters, and propose CanonSeg4D, which estimates per-frame offsets to map observed parts to a learned canonical space for better segmentation.

Result: Experiments on Artic4D show that CanonSeg4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panoptic segmentation accuracy, especially in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical alignment, advancing 4D articulated object perception.

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dense Motion Captioning (DMC), a new task for temporally localizing and captioning actions in 3D human motion sequences. It also presents CompMo, a large-scale dataset with rich annotations, and DEMO, a model combining a language model with a motion adapter, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the under-explored area of motion understanding in 3D human motion and language integration, where current datasets lack detailed temporal annotations and complex sequences.

Method: The authors propose DMC and introduce CompMo, a dataset with 60,000 motion sequences annotated with precise temporal boundaries. They also develop DEMO, a model integrating a large language model with a motion adapter for dense captioning.

Result: DEMO significantly outperforms existing methods on CompMo and adapted benchmarks, demonstrating robust performance in motion understanding and captioning.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a strong baseline for future research in 3D motion understanding, highlighting the effectiveness of DEMO and the utility of CompMo for advancing the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1, a reinforcement learning framework for visual quality assessment, unifies score regression and ranking consistency, achieving state-of-the-art results with human-aligned reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual quality assessment rely on shallow reasoning and lack cross-domain generalization. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: PreResQ-R1 uses a dual-branch reward formulation with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-grained reasoning. It also includes a global-temporal and local-spatial strategy for video quality assessment.

Result: PreResQ-R1 achieves top performance on 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks, with improvements of 5.30% and 2.15% in IQA tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reasoning and generalization in quality assessment, producing interpretable and human-aligned results.

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

Result: The system successfully connects assembly instructions with real-time component locations, validated via LEGO sculpture assembly.

Conclusion: The AI-assisted AR workflow proves feasible for simplifying assembly tasks, leveraging object recognition for efficiency.

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

Motivation: Challenges in creating high-quality personalized hand avatars due to complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, especially under limited views and lighting. Lack of diverse datasets exacerbates the problem.

Method: Introduces PALM, a large-scale dataset with 13k hand scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images. Uses PALM-Net for inverse rendering to learn geometry and material properties.

Result: PALM dataset provides diverse, high-quality hand scans and images. PALM-Net enables realistic, relightable single-image hand avatar personalization.

Conclusion: PALM's scale and diversity make it a significant resource for hand modeling and related research.

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

TL;DR: MPRF is a multimodal pipeline using transformer-based models for robust loop closure in GNSS-denied environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in precision and pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in visual place recognition and LiDAR-based methods in unstructured environments, particularly for planetary exploration.

Method: Combines DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for visual retrieval and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification, integrating a two-stage strategy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in precision and robustness, especially in low-texture regions, on the S3LI and S3LI Vulcano datasets.

Conclusion: MPRF offers a balanced approach for accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, showcasing the potential of foundation models in unifying place recognition and pose estimation.

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple modification to convolution layers for continual learning in image restoration, enabling task adaptation without architectural changes, minimal computational overhead, and improved performance on new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of continual learning in image restoration without requiring heavily engineered architectural modifications or significant computational overhead.

Method: Proposes a modified convolution layer to adapt knowledge from previous tasks while keeping the main backbone architecture unchanged.

Result: The model successfully introduces new restoration tasks without degrading performance on existing tasks and improves new task performance by leveraging prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning in image restoration, applicable to any deep architecture.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is

Motivation: The goal is to create a system that generates natural, expressive speech and synchronized facial motion from text, preserving speaker identity and improving upon existing methods.

Method: The framework uses a Text-to-Vec module to generate Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which condition both speech and face generation. It employs a two-stage training process: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and finetuning on TTS outputs to handle feature distribution shifts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the framework outperforms cascaded pipelines, enhancing lip-sync accuracy and visual realism by conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively synthesizes talking faces from text, achieving superior performance in audio-visual alignment and realism without relying on ground-truth audio.

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud transformers use dense token representations, leading to high computational and memory costs. The authors identify token redundancy as a key inefficiency.

Method: The proposed gitmerge3D is a globally informed graph token merging method that significantly reduces token count while preserving competitive task performance.

Result: Experiments show gitmerge3D reduces tokens by 90-95% without sacrificing performance, validating its efficiency across multiple 3D vision tasks.

Conclusion: The work challenges the assumption that more tokens improve performance, highlighting over-tokenization in current models, and offers a scalable solution for efficient 3D foundation models.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and

Result: Damage detection works well despite resolution; simpler models generalize better than complex ones or geospatial foundation models.

Conclusion: Copernicus images are viable for wide-area damage assessment, complementing VHR imagery, supported by released dataset and models.

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

*Jakub Paplham,Vojtech Franc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for estimating the year a photo was taken using facial data, supported by a new dataset (CSFD-1.6M), and shows improved accuracy by aggregating evidence from multiple faces in an image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve photo dating by leveraging facial information, as existing methods rely on scene-based data, which may not always be reliable or available.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic framework combining modern face recognition and age estimation models with career-based temporal priors to infer the photo capture year.

Result: The approach outperforms scene-based baselines, especially for images with multiple identifiable individuals, demonstrating the value of multi-face information aggregation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of using facial data and multi-face aggregation for accurate photo dating, with potential applications in digital archiving and historical research.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time flow regime classification framework using neuromorphic sensors, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods with high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow boiling's thermal performance and reliability are disrupted by sudden regime shifts, necessitating accurate, low-latency monitoring. Conventional optical methods fall short due to high computational demands.

Method: A framework based on neuromorphic sensors detects edge motion via brightness changes, avoiding full-frame reconstruction. Five models (traditional and event-based) are developed and compared.

Result: Event-based models outperform frame-based ones, with an LSTM model achieving 97.6% accuracy and 0.28 ms processing time. Asynchronous processing ensures stable, real-time feedback.

Conclusion: The event-based neuromorphic approach enhances real-time flow regime classification, offering reliable, efficient monitoring for thermal management.

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

TL;DR: Combining NLP with advanced visual backbones improves tiny object detection, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance tiny object detection by aligning semantic cues from text with visual features using advanced backbone architectures.

Method: Integrates BERT with CNN-based PRB-FPN-Net, using ELAN, MSP, and CSP backbones and fine-tuning techniques for feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 52.6% AP on COCO2017, outperforming YOLO-World and GLIP with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of combining NLP and advanced backbones for scalable, accurate object detection.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone
architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,
and adaptability to real-world challenges.

*Guojie Li,Anwar P. P. Abdul Majeed,Muhammad Ateeq,Anh Nguyen,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN improves medical image segmentation with lightweight, interpretable methods, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency than U-KAN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of convolutional and Transformer architectures in medical image segmentation, such as lack of adaptive nonlinearity, opaque attention mechanisms, and scalability issues.

Method: Introduces GroupKAN with Grouped KAN Transform (reduces complexity via channel grouping) and Grouped KAN Activation (shared spline-based mappings).

Result: Achieves 79.80% average IoU on medical benchmarks, outperforming U-KAN (+1.11%) with fewer parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M).

Conclusion: GroupKAN offers scalable, efficient, and interpretable solutions for medical image segmentation, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

*Junwen Pan,Qizhe Zhang,Rui Zhang,Ming Lu,Xin Wan,Yuan Zhang,Chang Liu,Qi She*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSearch-R introduces an RL-based method (GRPO-CSV) for temporal search, improving video reasoning completeness and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal search methods lack end-to-end optimization for optimal search strategies.

Method: Proposes TimeSearch-R with GRPO-CSV, integrating RL and self-verification to enhance video reasoning.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on benchmarks like Haystack-LVBench and LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R sets a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating the effectiveness of RL and self-verification in temporal search.

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Spatial Tuning (VST), a framework to enhance spatial perception and reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without harming general capabilities, using large-scale datasets and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatial awareness in VLMs without adding extra encoders or compromising general performance, aiming for human-like visuospatial abilities.

Method: Develops VST-P (4.1M samples for perception) and VST-R (135K samples for reasoning), then uses supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for progressive training.

Result: Achieves SOTA on spatial benchmarks (34.8% on MMSI-Bench, 61.2% on VSIBench), showing enhanced abilities without side effects.

Conclusion: VST effectively improves VLMs' spatial capabilities, advancing physically grounded AI.

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

### [66] [Evaluating LLMs' Reasoning Over Ordered Procedural Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04688)
*Adrita Anika,Md Messal Monem Miah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to reconstruct correct sequences from shuffled procedural steps, using food recipes as a domain, and finds performance declines with longer sequences and more severe shuffling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' procedural reasoning capabilities, especially in tasks where step order critically impacts outcomes.

Method: Evaluated LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings using metrics like Kendall's Tau, NLCS, and NED on shuffled recipe steps.

Result: Performance declines with longer sequences and greater step displacement, highlighting limitations in handling longer, disordered inputs.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with procedural reasoning for longer and more disordered sequences, revealing limitations in their sequencing capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly
impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In
this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from
shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain
where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several
LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive
evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence
alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence
(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects
of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with
increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer
procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,
corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning,
especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATLAS introduces an adaptive testing framework using Item Response Theory (IRT) to reduce benchmark items by 90% while maintaining precision, revealing annotation errors in static evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model evaluations are slow and costly due to large fixed benchmark sets treating all items equally, ignoring quality variations.

Method: ATLAS uses IRT and Fisher information-guided item selection to adaptively estimate model ability, analyzing benchmark item quality and reducing redundancy.

Result: ATLAS achieves 90% item reduction with minimal accuracy loss (e.g., 42 items suffice for HellaSwag), identifies annotation errors, and shows significant rank shifts (23-31% of models shift >10 ranks).

Conclusion: ATLAS offers a scalable, precise alternative to static benchmarks, improving efficiency and revealing hidden biases in evaluations.

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making
evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy
across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and
informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item
Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher
information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks
reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating
annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item
reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items),
we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our
framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%,
compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure).
Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with
the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by
more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at

*Jingqing Wang,Jiaxing Shang,Rong Xu,Fei Hao,Tianjin Huang,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SARC, a framework combining sentiment analysis and role clustering to improve fake news detection by differentiating user roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat sentiment features as auxiliary, missing the nuanced role differentiation in sentiment polarity, which limits fake news detection.

Method: SARC uses sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles, employing joint comment text representation (BiGRU and Attention) and a differentiable clustering module. It also integrates role clustering and fake news detection in a joint optimization objective.

Result: SARC outperforms baseline models on RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp datasets across all metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed SARC framework effectively captures nuanced user roles through sentiment analysis, enhancing fake news detection performance.

Abstract: Fake news detection has been a long-standing research focus in social
networks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from
both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However,
existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals,
overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may
originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to
capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we
propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes
sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake
news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint
comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment
encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to
automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which
take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint
optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to
further improve the model performance. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets, RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp, demonstrate that SARC achieves superior
performance across all metrics compared to baseline models. The code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces VerIH, a dataset for training LLMs to prioritize instructions hierarchically, enhancing reliability and safety in decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconciling conflicting instructions in LLMs from multiple sources, ensuring reliability and controllability in high-stakes applications.

Method: Reframing instruction hierarchy as a reasoning task, constructing the VerIH dataset, and using lightweight reinforcement learning to train models for instruction prioritization.

Result: Finetuned models show improved instruction following, better hierarchy resolution, and enhanced robustness against adversarial inputs like jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning over instruction hierarchies offers a practical approach to making LLMs more reliable, controllable, and safe, with updates to system prompts effectively guiding model behavior.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in
real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from
multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single
prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where
higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the
reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction
hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first
"think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority
(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability
via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of
constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both
aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight
reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning
capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models
achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction
hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to
safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety
issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined
higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against
jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that
reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable
LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in
model behavior.

Conclusion: The model is effective, lightweight, and deployable, emphasizing fairness, bias mitigation, and human oversight for reliable mental health support.

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is
critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to
appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned
RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health
conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple
curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,
revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well
as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.
Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,
domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models
demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro
F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup
(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline
classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including
Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues
that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression
from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned
transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,
while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and
human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as
a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental
health platforms.

*Song Wang,Zihan Chen,Peng Wang,Zhepei Wei,Zhen Tan,Yu Meng,Cong Shen,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WinnowRAG is a novel RAG framework that filters noisy documents while preserving useful content through query-aware clustering and iterative winnowing, improving response accuracy without model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with accessing up-to-date or specialized information, and increasing retrieved documents in RAG can introduce noise, reducing response accuracy.

Method: WinnowRAG operates in two stages: (1) query-aware clustering and agent-based answer generation, and (2) winnowing via a critic LLM to separate useful from noisy documents, with strategic merging to retain relevant knowledge.

Result: WinnowRAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving response accuracy.

Conclusion: WinnowRAG is a model-agnostic, adaptable framework that enhances RAG by systematically reducing noise in retrieved documents, making it suitable for diverse tasks without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in
accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase
the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of
retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce
significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby
reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the
challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose
WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy
documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as
winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware
clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each
cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage
II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of
multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To
retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic
merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for
generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does

TL;DR: This paper systematically reviews 445 LLM benchmarks, identifies validity issues, and provides eight recommendations for improving benchmark development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM capabilities and identify safety or robustness issues before deployment by ensuring strong construct validity in benchmarks.

Method: A team of 29 expert reviewers conducted a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading NLP and ML conferences.

Result: Patterns undermining claim validity were found in measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics.

Conclusion: Eight key recommendations and actionable guidance are provided to improve LLM benchmark development.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial for both assessing their
capabilities and identifying safety or robustness issues prior to deployment.
Reliably measuring abstract and complex phenomena such as 'safety' and
'robustness' requires strong construct validity, that is, having measures that
represent what matters to the phenomenon. With a team of 29 expert reviewers,
we conduct a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading conferences
in natural language processing and machine learning. Across the reviewed
articles, we find patterns related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and
scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the resulting claims. To
address these shortcomings, we provide eight key recommendations and detailed
actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners in developing LLM
benchmarks.

### [75] [POLIS-Bench: Towards Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of LLMs for Bilingual Policy Tasks in Governmental Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04705)
*Tingyue Yang,Junchi Yao,Yuhui Guo,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POLIS-Bench is a novel evaluation suite for LLMs in governmental bilingual policy scenarios, featuring an updated bilingual corpus, scenario-grounded tasks, and a dual-metric framework. It highlights reasoning models' superiority and enables cost-effective, compliant solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of rigorous, systematic benchmarks for LLMs in bilingual policy settings to ensure relevance and effectiveness in governance.

Method: Developed an up-to-date bilingual corpus, designed three specialized tasks (Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, Compliance Judgment), and introduced a dual-metric framework (semantic similarity + accuracy rate).

Result: Evaluation of 10+ LLMs showed reasoning models excel in cross-task stability and accuracy. A fine-tuned lightweight model (POLIS series) matched or outperformed proprietary baselines at lower cost.

Conclusion: POLIS-Bench provides a robust, cost-effective framework for evaluating and deploying LLMs in real-world governmental policy applications.

Abstract: We introduce POLIS-Bench, the first rigorous, systematic evaluation suite
designed for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios.
Compared to existing benchmarks, POLIS-Bench introduces three major
advancements. (i) Up-to-date Bilingual Corpus: We construct an extensive,
up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment
sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii)
Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded
tasks -- Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the
Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and
application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel
dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy
rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement
adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on
POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models
maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the
difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we
successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS
series models achieves parity with, or surpasses, strong proprietary baselines
on multiple policy subtasks at a significantly reduced cost, providing a
cost-effective and compliant path for robust real-world governmental
deployment.

TL;DR: GEMMA-SQL is a lightweight, efficient text-to-SQL model built on Gemma 2B, achieving high accuracy with resource-efficient fine-tuning and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical, open-source text-to-SQL system that works well on low-cost hardware and is accessible to users without programming knowledge.

Method: Fine-tuning the Gemma 2B architecture iteratively and using multiple prompting strategies like few-shot learning, trained and evaluated on the SPIDER benchmark.

Result: GEMMA-SQL Instruct achieves 66.8% Test-Suite accuracy and 63.3% Exact Set Match accuracy, outperforming baselines like IRNet and CodeXDavinci.

Conclusion: Effective prompt design and instruction tuning can enhance performance while maintaining scalability, making GEMMA-SQL a robust, accessible alternative for text-to-SQL tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems enable users to interact with structured databases using
natural language, eliminating the need for specialized programming knowledge.
In this work, we introduce GEMMA-SQL, a lightweight and efficient text-to-SQL
model built upon the open-source Gemma 2B architecture. Unlike many large
language models (LLMs), GEMMA-SQL is fine-tuned in a resource-efficient,
iterative manner and can be deployed on low-cost hardware. Leveraging the
SPIDER benchmark for training and evaluation, GEMMA-SQL combines multiple
prompting strategies, including few-shot learning, to enhance SQL query
generation accuracy. The instruction-tuned variant, GEMMA-SQL Instruct,
achieves 66.8% Test-Suite accuracy and 63.3% Exact Set Match accuracy,
outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines such as IRNet, RYANSQL, and
CodeXDavinci. The proposed approach demonstrates that effective prompt design
and targeted instruction tuning can significantly boost performance while
maintaining high scalability and adaptability. These results position GEMMA-SQL
as a practical, open-source alternative for robust and accessible text-to-SQL
systems.

*Dmytro Vitel,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges prior findings that first layers are most informative for influence estimation in LLMs, proposing middle attention layers as better estimators and introducing improved aggregation and evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of the cancellation effect in influence estimation and improve methods for interpreting LLM decisions.

Method: Proposes theoretical and empirical evidence, introduces alternatives to standard averaging (like ranking and vote-based methods), and develops a new metric (Noise Detection Rate).

Result: Middle attention layers outperform first layers for influence estimation, and new aggregation/evaluation methods significantly improve performance.

Conclusion: First layers are not necessarily better than last layers for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge.

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM)
decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and
auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation
methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing
information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order
gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of
billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to
some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal
work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for
computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers
are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on
influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,
we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the
cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better
estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of
aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to
standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to
significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for
evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model
retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)
that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.
Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we
concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than
the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior
knowledge in the field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RADAR improves rare disease detection in brain MRI by using AI agents to retrieve relevant medical knowledge without additional training, boosting performance by 10.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing AI model failures in rare disease detection due to scarce training data by mimicking radiologists' consultation of case reports and literature.

Method: Uses AI agents with sentence transformers to embed and index case reports and literature (FAISS), enabling efficient similarity search for diagnostic guidance.

Result: Achieves a 10.2% performance gain on the NOVA dataset (280 rare diseases), especially benefiting open-source models like DeepSeek.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented reasoning enhances rare disease recognition and interpretability in medical imaging, offering a model-agnostic solution.

Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models
often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical
workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when
confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we
introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic
system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents
with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and
literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable
efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence
to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of
additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can
be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently
improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA
dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%
performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source
models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide
interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting
retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence
conditions in medical imaging.

*Nikolai Ilinykh,Simon Dobnik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces surprisal variance as a metric for linguistic diversity in image captioning, comparing humans and models using different scorers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and compare linguistic diversity in image captions generated by humans and state-of-the-art models.

Method: Compare five LLMs and human captions on MSCOCO using surprisal variance (token-level negative log-probabilities) decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling. Evaluate diversity with caption-trained and general-language LMs.

Result: Humans show higher surprisal variance than models with a caption-trained LM, but the pattern reverses with a general-language LM.

Conclusion: Surprisal-based diversity evaluation requires multiple scorers for robust conclusions, as relying on one can invert results.

Abstract: We quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning with surprisal variance
- the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a caption set. On
the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs,
decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a
caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance
of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model
reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity
metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can
completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report
surprisal under several scorers.

*Chenxi Liu,Junjie Liang,Yuqi Jia,Bochuan Cao,Yang Bai,Heng Huang,Xun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ERPO improves RLVR by exploring residual prompts to revive training signals, outperforming baselines in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residual prompts with zero variance rewards hinder training diversity and effectiveness in large language model reinforcement learning.

Method: ERPO uses a history tracker and adaptive temperature to encourage diverse reasoning on residual prompts, reviving training signals.

Result: ERPO outperforms baselines on the Qwen2.5 series across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ERPO effectively exploits residual prompts, enhancing model training and performance in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an
effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has
demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models
train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,
those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,
fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering
effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore
Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages
exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO
maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the
sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct
responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces,
introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results
on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong
baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

### [81] [Trained on Tokens, Calibrated on Concepts: The Emergence of Semantic Calibration in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04869)
*Preetum Nakkiran,Arwen Bradley,Adam Goliński,Eugene Ndiaye,Michael Kirchhof,Sinead Williamson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Base LLMs exhibit semantic calibration in open-domain question-answering tasks, despite no explicit training. Theory links this to next-token prediction, and experiments confirm calibration breaks with RL instruction-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for their outputs. The paper investigates whether base LLMs can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond token-level calibration.

Method: Uses a sampling-based notion of semantic calibration and connects it to next-token prediction via theoretical insights on calibration and local loss optimality. Introduces "B-calibration," a general calibration framework.

Result: Base LLMs are semantically calibrated in open-domain QA tasks. RL instruction-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning systematically break this calibration.

Conclusion: The study provides the first principled explanation for semantic calibration in LLMs, linking it to next-token prediction and demonstrating calibration's fragility under certain training and reasoning methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for
their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it
remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of
their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain
sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably
well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain
question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our
main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic
calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a
recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory
relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of
calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or
otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base
LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own
distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We
state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through
experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across
question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this
calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our
knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why
semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

*Matthew Bozoukov,Matthew Nguyen,Shubkarman Singh,Bart Bussmann,Patrick Leask*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can develop self-awareness of their behaviors without supervision, raising safety concerns. Minimal conditions and mechanisms for this were studied using LoRA adapters, revealing it's domain-specific and modifiable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs gain self-awareness of their behaviors and the safety implications of this capability.

Method: Controlled finetuning experiments on LLMs using low-rank adapters (LoRA), specifically rank-1 LoRA, to analyze self-awareness emergence.

Result: Self-awareness is reliably induced with a single rank-1 LoRA, captured by a steering vector, and is domain-specific with independent task representations.

Conclusion: Behavioral self-awareness in LLMs is a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness:
the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors
without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may,
for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during
evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such
self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it
manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs
with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably
induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware
behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation
space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that
self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent
representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral
self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily
induced and modulated.

*Jaehoon Lee,Sohyun Kim,Wanggeun Park,Geon Lee,Seungkyung Kim,Minyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: We introduce SDS KoPub VDR, a large-scale benchmark for retrieving and understanding Korean public documents, addressing the lack of non-English and structurally complex benchmarks in visual document retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VDR benchmarks largely ignore non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications, creating a critical gap in the field.

Method: The benchmark is built on 361 real-world Korean documents (40,781 pages), with 600 query-page-answer triples generated via multimodal models and human verification. Queries span six public domains and are categorized by reasoning modality (text, visual, cross-modal).

Result: Evaluation on text-only and multimodal retrieval tasks reveals significant performance gaps, especially in cross-modal scenarios, even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SDS KoPub VDR serves as a foundational resource for advancing multimodal AI in document intelligence, enabling rigorous evaluation and highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook
non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first
large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding
Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world
documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and
105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables,
charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable
evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were
initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently
underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure
factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public
domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required:
text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We
evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct
retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability
to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2)
multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features
(e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This
dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in
multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art
models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and
fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also
provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world
document intelligence.

*Chandra Vamsi Krishna Alla,Harish Naidu Gaddam,Manohar Kommi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BudgetMem is a memory-efficient architecture for LLMs that selectively stores important information under strict budget constraints, achieving near-baseline performance while saving memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational and memory challenges of LLMs when processing long contexts, BudgetMem aims to make advanced language understanding accessible on modest hardware.

Method: Combines selective memory policies with salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) and BM25 sparse retrieval for efficient information access.

Result: Achieves only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG, with benefits increasing for longer documents.

Conclusion: BudgetMem offers a practical solution for deploying long-context systems on resource-constrained hardware, democratizing access to advanced language capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for
applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session
dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context
windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource
constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented
architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.
Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience
scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide
which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike
existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,
BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval
for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700
question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)
documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves
remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while
saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through
budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline
comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits
increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for
deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access
to advanced language understanding capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for baseline and dataset recommendation in AI research, addressing prior limitations like limited data coverage and superficial similarity biases. It leverages citation networks, automated data collection, and a reasoning-augmented retriever-ranker system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for dataset and baseline recommendation suffer from limited coverage and reliance on superficial similarity, hindering reliable automation of experimental design.

Method: The framework includes an automated data-collection pipeline linking papers to used datasets/baselines, a collective perception-enhanced retriever, and a reasoning-augmented reranker.

Result: The method achieves +5.85% Recall@20 and +8.30% HitRate@5 improvements, covering 85% of datasets/baselines from top AI conferences.

Conclusion: The approach advances reliable and interpretable automation of experimental design in AI research.

Abstract: Large language model agents are becoming increasingly capable at web-centric
tasks such as information retrieval, complex reasoning. These emerging
capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM
agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is
to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval.
However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation
datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many
datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content
similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks
experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the
baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for
baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated
data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted
papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a
collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each
dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates
self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient
candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations.
Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction
chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language
model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset
we curated covers 85\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences
over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the
strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\% in Recall@20, +8.30\% in
HitRate@5. Taken together, our results advance reliable, interpretable
automation of experimental design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Summary: Study validates classification errors in Wikidata using a new method, proposes evaluation criteria, and develops a system for inspecting taxonomic relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata's openness and size make it a key knowledge graph, but its loose editorial policy introduces taxonomic inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes and applies a novel validation method to detect classification errors, over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections.

Result: Confirms taxonomic issues in specific Wikidata domains and introduces a new evaluation criterion for corrections.

Conclusion: Develops a system enabling users to inspect taxonomic relationships, leveraging Wikidata's crowdsourced nature effectively.

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web,
encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various
domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from
Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness
has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and
has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its
relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic
inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel
validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors,
over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains
of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining
whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users
to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata
entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

*Wei Shao,Lingchao Zheng,Pengyu Wang,Peizhen Zheng,Jun Li,Yuwei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoPT is a lossless parallel tokenization framework for large language models, addressing speed and consistency issues in long-context inference by using character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context inference is computationally slow, and tokenization remains a bottleneck despite prior optimizations. Existing parallel methods introduce inconsistencies due to boundary artifacts.

Method: LoPT employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment to align and merge tokenized segments accurately, ensuring lossless results.

Result: Experiments show LoPT achieves significant speedup while guaranteeing lossless tokenization, validated by theoretical proofs and robustness studies.

Conclusion: LoPT effectively addresses the tokenization bottleneck in long-context inference, offering consistent and efficient performance.

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large
language models, yet they introduce significant computational latency. While
prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model
architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked
bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing
through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from
inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To
address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework
that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach
employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment
to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across
diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup
while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of
consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of
our method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines LLMs' ability to role-play morally ambiguous or villainous characters, revealing a decline in fidelity as character morality decreases, with safety-aligned models performing poorly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the conflict between LLMs' safety alignment and their ability to authentically simulate morally ambiguous or villainous personas, which remains unexamined.

Method: Introduces the Moral RolePlay benchmark with a four-level moral alignment scale and evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs in role-playing characters from moral paragons to villains.

Result: LLMs show a decline in role-playing fidelity for less moral characters, struggling with traits like deceitfulness. Safety-aligned models perform poorly in villain role-play.

Conclusion: Highlights a tension between model safety and creative fidelity, calling for more nuanced alignment methods. The benchmark aids future development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

### [89] [Acquiring Common Chinese Emotional Events Using Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04989)
*Ya Wang,Guangzheng Zhu,Cungen Cao,Jingjing Li,He Li,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to acquire common Chinese emotional events using a large language model, filters for quality, and classifies them by sentiment, resulting in a large-scale knowledge base.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional events are valuable but difficult to acquire, especially context-independent ones. The goal is to create a large-scale commonsense knowledge base of such events in Chinese.

Method: The approach involves collecting emotional event indicators, prompting a Chinese LLM to generate events, filtering invalid results, and classifying events by sentiment (positive/negative).

Result: A total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment labels were harvested, validated by intrinsic evaluation and demonstrated in an extrinsic use case (ECE).

Conclusion: The method effectively acquires Chinese emotional events and shows strong potential for applications like emotion cause extraction. Resources will be publicly released.

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has
been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However,
emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized
emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to
obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and
"be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of
Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by
prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To
ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard
invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being
positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we
harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment
polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of
emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that
the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common
Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong
potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction
(ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional
events will be released after the publication of this paper.

*Prasoon Varshney,Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar,Liwei Jiang,Traian Rebedea,Christopher Parisien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PBSUITE is a dynamic evaluation suite (dataset + framework) designed to assess LLMs' compliance with diverse behavioral policies in multi-turn interactions, revealing significant weaknesses in current alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM applications require adaptability to diverse organizational policies and user needs, but current alignment methods are insufficient for pluralistic contexts.

Method: Developed PBSUITE, a suite with 300 real-world behavioral policies across 30 industries and a dynamic evaluation framework to test LLM compliance under adversarial multi-turn interactions.

Result: LLMs perform well in single-turn settings (<4% failure) but struggle in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure), indicating gaps in current alignment techniques.

Conclusion: PBSUITE provides tools for future research to improve robust and context-aware pluralistic alignment, addressing real-world LLM application challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of
safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet,
real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational
ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,
use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights
the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic
alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse
user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE
(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'
capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,
interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300
realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic
evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral
specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that
leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral
policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their
compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to
84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and
safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic
behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both
the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust
and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating language models' code generation and problem-solving in Ukrainian, revealing that even top models struggle with half the tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating large language models for low-resource languages like Ukrainian, particularly in code generation and competitive programming tasks.

Method: Created a benchmark with 500 Eolymp problems across five complexity levels, evaluated 13 models using one-shot Python solutions via hidden tests in the Eolymp environment.

Result: Top models like OpenAI o3 and GPT-5 solved only 50% of problems, highlighting challenges in low-resource language code generation. Performance varied by difficulty, with analysis of uniqueness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The benchmark emphasizes the need for multilingual evaluation and aids future research on reasoning-enhanced models. Resources are open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource
languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on
widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language
understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark
established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and
competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark
comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five
complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading
proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a
one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against
hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even
top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the
problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural
language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of
performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of
solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time
and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work
demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating
large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves
the way for future research on multilingual code generation and
reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code
generation, and evaluation scripts are available at

### [92] [Order-Level Attention Similarity Across Language Models: A Latent Commonality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05064)
*Jinglin Liang,Jin Zhong,Shuangping Huang,Yunqing Hu,Huiyuan Zhang,Huifang Li,Lixin Fan,Hanlin Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates shared patterns in context aggregation across Language Models (LMs) using Order-Level Attention (OLA), revealing similarities and a link to syntactic knowledge, leading to a transferable adapter method (TOA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover commonalities in context aggregation across LMs for deeper understanding and cross-model knowledge transfer.

Method: Introduces OLA from attention rollout, identifies similarities across LMs, and proposes TOA, a training-free adapter using OLA as syntactic feature representation.

Result: OLA shows significant similarities across LMs, and TOA enhances performance of unseen LMs without parameter updates.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of OLA for cross-LM transfer and syntactic knowledge mapping, validated by TOA's effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do
context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities?
While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in
LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a
systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In
contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our
understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In
this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the
order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the
same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we
discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on
these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a
training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA
as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes
OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter
generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances
the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for multilingual claim normalization in misinformation detection, using systematic decomposition and cross-lingual transfer with strong results across 20 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve misinformation detection by transforming noisy social media posts into verifiable statements across multiple languages, addressing the challenge of cross-lingual generalization.

Method: The approach finetunes Qwen3-14B using LoRA, incorporates intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering, and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning for semantic alignment during inference.

Result: The system achieves METEOR scores from 41.16 (English) to 15.21 (Marathi), ranking third for English and fourth for Dutch and Punjabi, with a 41.3% improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: The method effectively generalizes across Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence, showcasing robust cross-lingual performance.

Abstract: We address claim normalization for multilingual misinformation detection -
transforming noisy social media posts into clear, verifiable statements across
20 languages. The key contribution demonstrates how systematic decomposition of
posts using Who, What, Where, When, Why and How questions enables robust
cross-lingual transfer despite training exclusively on English data. Our
methodology incorporates finetuning Qwen3-14B using LoRA with the provided
dataset after intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering for
semantic alignment and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning with contextual
examples during inference. Our system achieves METEOR scores ranging from 41.16
(English) to 15.21 (Marathi), securing third rank on the English leaderboard
and fourth rank for Dutch and Punjabi. The approach shows 41.3% relative
improvement in METEOR over baseline configurations and substantial gains over
existing methods. Results demonstrate effective cross-lingual generalization
for Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence across
diverse linguistic structures.

### [94] [On Text Simplification Metrics and General-Purpose LLMs for Accessible Health Information, and A Potential Architectural Advantage of The Instruction-Tuned LLM class](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05080)
*P. Bilha Githinji,Aikaterini Meilliou,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for automatic text simplification, comparing Mistral 24B and QWen2.5 32B. Mistral outperforms in readability and discourse fidelity, suggesting instruction-tuning benefits scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical info requires scalable solutions for simplifying complex documents.

Method: Comparative analysis of Mistral 24B (instruction-tuned) and QWen2.5 32B (reasoning-augmented) using readability metrics (e.g., SARI) and discourse fidelity (BERTScore).

Result: Mistral shows better readability (SARI mean 42.46) and discourse fidelity (BERTScore 0.91), while QWen struggles to balance readability and accuracy.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs like Mistral are more suitable for simplification, with lexical support being a key adaptation issue. Metric selection heuristics are provided.

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical
information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for
automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain
language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large
language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating
the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring
preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the
performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their
linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a
human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral
24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential
architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a
tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a
suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),
while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also
attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a
disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a
statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a
comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,
discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for
mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five
readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the
evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the
instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics
for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary
domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

*Grigory Kovalev,Mikhail Tikhomirov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores distillation methods for large language models (LLMs) to create compact models with minimal performance loss. An improved technique based on iterative layer importance evaluation is proposed, reducing layers from 36 to 28 or 24 with quality losses of 9.7% and 18%, respectively. The method is effective for resource-limited deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient and compact language models while preserving high performance, addressing the limitations of existing distillation methods.

Method: An improved distillation approach based on ShortGPT, using iterative evaluation of layer importance and joint loss functions (KL divergence and mean squared error).

Result: Reduction of layers from 36 to 28 (2.47B parameters) with 9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with 18% loss, showing middle layers contribute less to inference.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative distillation and fine-tuning method is effective for creating efficient models, suitable for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs)
with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance.
Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective
strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach
has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative
evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by
measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a
set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training
using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be
reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a
9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that
the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the
potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making
the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization for LLMs, including decomposed evolution steps, an LLM-based judge, human feedback integration, and efficient evaluation strategies, enhancing quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evolutionary prompt optimization methods lack robust operators and efficient evaluation, prompting the need for enhanced techniques.

Method: Key improvements include decomposing evolution steps, using an LLM-based judge, integrating human feedback, and developing efficient evaluation strategies.

Result: The proposed approach improves both the quality and efficiency of prompt optimization.

Conclusion: The work advances prompt optimization for LLMs and releases code to support further research and application.

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining
prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and
efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key
improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize
to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps
to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to
verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary
operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain
performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both
optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt
optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

TL;DR: ManufactuBERT, a domain-specific RoBERTa model pretrained on a deduplicated manufacturing corpus, outperforms general models and reduces training costs by 33%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose models lack domain-specific knowledge, especially in specialized fields like manufacturing.

Method: Introduces a data processing pipeline for corpus creation, involving domain-specific filtering and multi-stage deduplication, followed by continual pretraining.

Result: ManufactuBERT achieves SOTA on manufacturing NLP tasks and reduces training time by 33%.

Conclusion: The pipeline and model offer a reproducible approach for developing specialized encoders.

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general
language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains
like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and
semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a
RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the
manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to
create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific
filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes
redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new
state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming
strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on
our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence,
leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to
training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a
reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other
specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at

TL;DR: CoT prompting enhances reasoning transfer in white-box KD from larger to smaller LLMs, improving performance on complex BBH tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how CoT can improve reasoning capability distillation in white-box KD from larger LLMs to smaller ones.

Method: Conducted white-box KD experiments using Qwen and Llama2 LLMs with CoT data from CoT-Collection, evaluated on BBH tasks.

Result: CoT improves white-box KD effectiveness, boosting distilled models' performance on BBH reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: CoT plays a critical role in enhancing reasoning transfer via white-box KD, benefiting smaller LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the
reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has
been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability
from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in
distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using
white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the
distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding
tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2
families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled
models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks
from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for
smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving
white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better
average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from
BBH.

TL;DR: The paper abstracts ancient Chinese-to-Japanese translation as sequence tagging, addresses low-resource issues with an LLM-based pipeline, and shows auxiliary tasks improve tagging performance, supplementing LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To modernize ancient translation methods by adapting them to sequence tagging tasks and tackling low-resource challenges.

Method: Introduces an LLM-based annotation pipeline and constructs a dataset from digitalized translations; uses auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks to enhance tagging.

Result: LLMs perform well in direct translation but struggle with character annotation; auxiliary tasks improve tagging performance under low-resource conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively supplements LLMs, enhancing sequence tagging tasks for ancient translations.

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating
around each character. We abstract this process as sequence tagging tasks and
fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and
translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by
introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from
digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource
setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the
training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large
language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but
they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could
work as a supplement of LLMs.

### [100] [Reflective Personalization Optimization: A Post-hoc Rewriting Framework for Black-Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05286)
*Teqi Hao,Xioayu Tan,Shaojie Shi,Yinghui Xu,Xihe Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a two-stage framework for personalizing black-box LLMs by decoupling content generation from user alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for personalizing LLMs rely on context injection, which burdens the model with simultaneous content generation and alignment, often compromising output quality. The paper addresses this trade-off by proposing a new paradigm.

Method: RPO operates in two stages: (1) a base model generates a generic response, and (2) an external reflection module rewrites it to align with user preferences. The module is trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments on the LaMP benchmark show RPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. It highlights the superiority of explicit response shaping over implicit context injection.

Conclusion: RPO introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer, offering a new direction for user-centric generation and seamless integration with any base model.

Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical
yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context
injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the
generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on
the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with
user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output
quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we
propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that
redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from
alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a
high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly
rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection
module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning
is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core
personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to
user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to
further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.
Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by
decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of
explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO
introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be
seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new
and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

*Shreya Gupta,Ojasva Saxena,Arghodeep Nandi,Sarah Masud,Kiran Garimella,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of analyzing podcasts' narrative frames using traditional language models and proposes a fine-tuned BERT model for more accurate and scalable analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Podcasts are influential but complex data sources for public discourse, requiring better tools to analyze their narrative structures.

Method: A fine-tuned BERT model is developed to link narrative frames to specific entities and correlate them with high-level topics.

Result: The model improves alignment with human judgment and reveals relationships between topics and frames in podcasts.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust framework for studying influence in digital media through more accurate podcast narrative analysis.

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them
a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically
unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex
form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine
their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant
challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,
typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to
capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative
frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing
podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that
explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the
conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our
approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with
high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions
of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely
aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new
analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being
discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a
more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

TL;DR: The paper explores extracting criminal behavior descriptions from Slovak court verdicts using regular expressions and LLMs, achieving high accuracy (up to 99.5%) when combined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Criminal justice data lacks detailed offense information, but court verdicts in continental Europe contain rich descriptions, which this study aims to extract.

Method: Two approaches were used: advanced regular expressions (focusing on 'sparing' normalization) and LLMs (Gemini Flash 2.0), with performance compared to a baseline regex method.

Result: Advanced regex and LLMs significantly outperformed the baseline (40.5%), achieving 97% and 98.75% accuracy, respectively, and 99.5% when combined. Human evaluation showed 90% alignment for advanced methods vs. 34.5% for baseline.

Conclusion: Combining advanced regex with LLMs provides highly accurate extraction of criminal behavior descriptions from court verdicts, nearly matching human annotation quality.

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of
information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of
extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions
of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly
available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for
retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline
was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words
occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression
approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of
spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description.
The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the
descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified
descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed
it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and
99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced
methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5%
for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of
instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached
92%.

TL;DR: BengaliBPE is a specialized BPE tokenizer for Bengali, outperforming existing methods in granularity and interpretability despite higher computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subword tokenizers perform poorly on morphologically rich languages like Bengali.

Method: BengaliBPE uses Unicode normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules.

Result: BengaliBPE offers better segmentation and interpretability than baselines but is slightly slower.

Conclusion: Language-aware tokenization is crucial for morphologically rich scripts, with BengaliBPE being a strong foundation for Bengali NLP.

Abstract: Tokenization is an important first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipelines because it decides how models learn and represent linguistic
information. However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or
HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do
not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address
this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer
specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode
normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules
to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a
large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with
three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The
evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream
classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE
provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological
interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These
findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for
morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation
for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual
language models.

### [104] [A multimodal multiplex of the mental lexicon for multilingual individuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05361)
*Maria Huynh,Wilder C. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how visual input in translation tasks affects language proficiency and accuracy in multilingual individuals, building on existing bilingual research frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the mental lexicon's structure in multilinguals and how visual inputs influence language acquisition, addressing earlier misconceptions about bilingualism's cognitive load.

Method: The research extends the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework and uses a multiplex model with additional visual input layers to study the effects on translation tasks.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the study seeks to determine if visual input enhances proficiency and accuracy in multilingual language tasks.

Conclusion: The abstract suggests that understanding the role of visual input in multilingual lexicons could provide deeper insights into language acquisition and cognitive benefits of bilingualism.

Abstract: Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive
load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over
the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies
have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word
recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel
activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll
et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals
who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in
various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language
Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of
the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak
multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who
investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental
lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by
Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer
network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design
extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex
model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their
corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the
mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language
influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the
presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants'
proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?

*Tiago Dinis,Miguel Correia,Roger Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RAGRecon, a system combining LLMs with RAG for cybersecurity threat intelligence, enhancing transparency via knowledge graphs, achieving over 91% accuracy in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional security mechanisms are insufficient against evolving cyber threats; LLMs with RAG can provide advanced, real-time threat intelligence.

Method: The system RAGRecon integrates LLMs and RAG to answer cybersecurity questions, generating explainable knowledge graphs for each response.

Result: Evaluation with two datasets and seven LLMs showed response accuracy exceeding 91% for top combinations.

Conclusion: RAGRecon demonstrates effective, transparent threat intelligence using LLMs and RAG, with high accuracy.

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in complexity, traditional security
mechanisms struggle to keep up. Large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential in cybersecurity due to their advanced capabilities in text
processing and generation. This paper explores the use of LLMs with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to obtain threat intelligence by combining
real-time information retrieval with domain-specific data. The proposed system,
RAGRecon, uses a LLM with RAG to answer questions about cybersecurity threats.
Moreover, it makes this form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) explainable by
generating and visually presenting to the user a knowledge graph for every
reply. This increases the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning of
the model, allowing analysts to better understand the connections made by the
system based on the context recovered by the RAG system. We evaluated RAGRecon
experimentally with two datasets and seven different LLMs and the responses
matched the reference responses more than 91% of the time for the best
combinations.

### [106] [Minority-Aware Satisfaction Estimation in Dialogue Systems via Preference-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05407)
*Yahui Fu,Zi Haur Pang,Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining individual and group-level preferences to improve user satisfaction estimation in dialogue systems, particularly benefiting minority users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods overlook minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation, leading to unequal satisfaction ratings.

Method: The framework includes Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning (CoPeR) for individual preferences, Majority-Minority Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) for group discovery, and PAda-PPO for joint optimization.

Result: Experiments show improved satisfaction estimation, especially for underrepresented groups.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively addresses user diversity, enhancing satisfaction estimation inclusively.

Abstract: User satisfaction in dialogue systems is inherently subjective. When the same
response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different
satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual
intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train
one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking
minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified
framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user
satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning
(CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning
chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority
Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user
groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we
integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning
framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and
group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset
demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation,
particularly for underrepresented user groups.

### [107] [Steering Language Models with Weight Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05408)
*Constanza Fierro,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Contrastive weight steering is a post-training method to edit LLM parameters using weight arithmetic, improving behavioral control and mitigating unintended generalizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality feedback for LLMs is costly and challenging, and narrow data can lead to unintended generalizations. This paper aims to leverage narrow data more effectively.

Method: The proposed contrastive weight steering subtracts weight deltas from two fine-tunes (desired and opposite behaviors) to isolate a behavior direction, then adjusts model weights accordingly.

Result: Weight steering outperforms activation steering in generalization and control, mitigating sycophancy and misalignment while preserving task performance.

Conclusion: Weight steering offers a promising approach for behavioral control and misalignment detection, suggesting potential for monitoring training evolution.

Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse
training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback
only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To
better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a
simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight
arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the
weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired
behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this
direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate
sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often
generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger
out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.
We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering
can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and
under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance
gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can
be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an
"evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the
evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that
never manifest during training or evaluations.

*Yuexin Wu,Shiqi Wang,Vasile Rus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a diagnostic dataset from EHR discharge notes aligned with WHO ICD-11, and LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that improves disease diagnosis accuracy by isolating semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance disease diagnosis by leveraging self-reports in EHRs, which often capture subtle but clinically important details missed by templated documentation.

Method: Developed MIMIC-SR-ICD11 dataset from EHR discharge notes and introduced LL-Rank, a framework using likelihood-based re-ranking to isolate semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

Result: LL-Rank consistently outperformed the baseline GenMap across seven model backbones, with gains attributed to its PMI-based scoring.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve diagnostic accuracy by better leveraging clinical report context and reducing label frequency bias, demonstrating the value of semantic compatibility in disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early
detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle
adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease.
Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic
health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle
but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce
MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge
notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present
LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a
length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report
context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that
label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong
generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that
LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates
semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

### [109] [Multi-Agent Craftax: Benchmarking Open-Ended Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning at the Hyperscale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04904)
*Bassel Al Omari,Michael Matthews,Alexander Rutherford,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop, extensions of the Craftax environment for multi-agent RL, designed to address long-term dependencies and complex cooperation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multi-agent RL lack the depth to evaluate long-term dependencies and generalization, prompting the need for more comprehensive environments.

Method: The authors develop Craftax-MA, a fast, open-ended multi-agent RL environment in JAX, and Craftax-Coop, an extension with heterogeneous agents and complex cooperation mechanics.

Result: The benchmarks reveal that current algorithms struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, exploration, and cooperation, highlighting gaps in MARL capabilities.

Conclusion: Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop offer robust benchmarks to drive future research in multi-agent RL by addressing existing limitations.

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging
benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing
benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately
stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in
many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present
\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,
Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general
abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is
exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment
interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling
challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension
introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require
complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating
that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark,
including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and
argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

### [110] [Stateful KV Cache Management for LLMs: Balancing Space, Time, Accuracy, and Positional Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04686)
*Pratik Poudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how KV cache management in LLMs, when exceeding trained context limits, degrades generation quality. It highlights the importance of preserving positional encodings and suggests contiguous block eviction strategies for better coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of unbounded KV cache growth in multi-turn scenarios and its impact on LLM generation quality, especially when exceeding the model's trained context window.

Method: Empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework to evaluate KV cache management strategies, focusing on positional encoding integrity and context window limits.

Result: LLM generation quality degrades sharply when KV cache exceeds the trained context window. Common eviction strategies that disrupt positional coherence worsen performance, while simple contiguous block preservation improves it.

Conclusion: Effective KV cache eviction should respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and prioritize cache health holistically, not just size.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in
large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn
scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between
KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of
positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking
framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the
accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window
(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory
exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via
AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.
Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a
cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to
degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving
contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more
coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate
for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional
structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

*Yue Xun,Jiaxing Xu,Wenbo Gao,Chen Yang,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing resting-state fMRI data by considering multi-frequency neuronal oscillations, improving diagnostic accuracy for brain disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models overlook the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations in BOLD signals, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for neurological disorders.

Method: The proposed framework uses Adaptive Cascade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to model intra- and cross-band interactions in a unified network, enhanced by a Unified-GCN for prediction.

Result: Tests on ADNI and ABIDE datasets show superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures frequency-specific disruptions in brain disorders, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders
and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els
largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial
fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they
often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade
Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism
within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The
  code is available at https://github.com/XXYY20221234/Ada-FCN.

*Qianyang Li,Xingjun Zhang,Peng Tao,Shaoxun Wang,Yancheng Pan,Jia Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AWEMixer addresses long-term IoT time series forecasting challenges with adaptive wavelet-enhanced frequency and temporal feature integration, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting long-term IoT time series is difficult due to non-stationary signals and error accumulation; traditional methods struggle with frequency and temporal balance.

Method: AWEMixer combines a Frequency Router for adaptive wavelet subband weighting and a Coherent Gated Fusion Block for selective feature integration.

Result: Outperforms transformer-based and MLP-based models on seven benchmarks, showing robust performance in long-sequence forecasting.

Conclusion: AWEMixer's adaptive time-frequency localization effectively improves long-term forecasting accuracy in IoT environments.

Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant
challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor
signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality
when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to
operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by
Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the
temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive
Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a
Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by
Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a
Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent
frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through
cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency
localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate
that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models.
Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared
with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence
time series forecasting. Code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and a modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) with Bi-LSTM for improved RUL prediction in industrial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with fine-grained temporal dependencies and dynamic feature prioritization, hindering robust prognostics.

Method: Integrates TCNs for local temporal features and a modified TFT with Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder to bridge short- and long-term dependencies, along with a multi-time-window approach for adaptability.

Result: Reduces average RMSE by up to 5.5% on benchmark datasets, showing improved predictive accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework addresses gaps in current approaches, enhancing industrial prognostic systems and showcasing the potential of advanced time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime,
and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models
struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically
prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a
modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder.
This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while
emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a
multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating
conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its
improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing
critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness
of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced
time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

*Matteo Cercola,Michele Lomuscio,Dario Piga,Simone Formentin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sensor-guided extension of GLISp that integrates measurable descriptors into preference-based optimization, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor data for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Preferential Bayesian Optimization and GLISp treat systems as black boxes, ignoring useful sensor data. This work aims to leverage sensor measurements for improved calibration.

Method: The proposed method extends GLISp by incorporating sensor data via a physics-informed hypothesis function and least-squares regularization, blending preference-based learning with quantitative information.

Result: Evaluations on benchmarks and vehicle suspension tuning show faster convergence and better solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

Conclusion: Integrating sensor data into preference-based optimization enhances performance, making the proposed method superior to traditional black-box approaches.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based
optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than
explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential
Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference
learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box
and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a
sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable
descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed
hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects
grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor
information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search.
Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop
vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final
solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

*Vaibhav Singh,Eugene Belilovsky,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores grokking in models with delayed generalization after overfitting, focusing on data-scarce regimes and distribution shifts. It shows that Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a grokked model can induce and accelerate grokking on new distributions, even with limited data. KD also enables generalization in joint distributions and mitigates forgetting in continual pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand grokking in low-data scenarios and how KD can facilitate generalization across distributions, addressing challenges in deployed models adapting to new data.

Method: Using KD from models that have grokked on one distribution to induce grokking on another, even with scarce data. Experiments include joint distribution training and continual pretraining setups.

Result: KD accelerates grokking and enables generalization in low-data and distribution shift scenarios. It also mitigates catastrophic forgetting in continual pretraining, achieving strong performance with minimal data.

Conclusion: KD is pivotal for generalization in data-scarce and evolving distribution settings, providing new insights into grokking dynamics under knowledge transfer.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models
exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus
on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the
critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios
involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)
from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and
accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available
data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for
deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We
then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that
while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has
insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual
distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual
pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find
that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,
achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our
results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge
transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in
low-data and evolving distribution settings.

*Rubens Lacouture,Nathan Zhang,Ritvik Sharma,Marco Siracusa,Fredrik Kjolstad,Kunle Olukotun,Olivia Hsu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuseFlow is a compiler that transforms sparse PyTorch models into optimized sparse dataflow graphs for RDAs, supporting cross-expression fusion and other optimizations. It demonstrates that full fusion isn't always optimal and provides performance improvements, including a ~2.7x speedup for GPT-3 with BigBird sparse attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address efficiency challenges in scaling deep learning models, leveraging sparse computation and specialized hardware like RDAs.

Method: Develops FuseFlow, a compiler supporting cross-expression fusion, parallelization, and other optimizations, targeting a cycle-accurate simulator for analysis.

Result: Shows fusion granularity impacts performance; achieves ~2.7x speedup for GPT-3 with BigBird sparse attention.

Conclusion: FuseFlow enables efficient sparse model execution on RDAs, with fusion strategies tailored to model specifics.

Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow
hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose
FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in
PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow
architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general
cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across
kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like
parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a
cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion
strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world
machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire
cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not
always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model
itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal
configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including
a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse
attention.

TL;DR: The paper revisits instruction prefetching for cloud workloads, introducing a compressed entry and hierarchical metadata storage to improve efficiency and reduce frontend stalls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inflated tail latency and energy in large-scale networked services caused by deep software stacks and microservice orchestration.

Method: Proposes a design with Compressed Entry (36 bits for up to eight destinations) and Hierarchical Metadata Storage, along with an Online ML Controller for prefetch profitability scoring.

Result: Achieves EIP-like speedups with smaller on-chip state and improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces frontend stalls and optimizes instruction prefetching for cloud workloads.

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice
orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls
that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for
these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self
optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we
introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a
base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical
Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried
entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further
add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using
context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications,
our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and
improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CNODE, a continuous neural ODE framework for forecasting individualized Parkinson's disease progression, addressing limitations of existing methods in handling irregular MRI data and capturing patient heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with irregular, sparse MRI data and fail to capture individual heterogeneity in PD progression, necessitating a novel approach for accurate forecasting.

Method: CNODE models brain morphological changes as continuous temporal processes using neural ODEs, incorporating patient-specific initial times and progression speeds to align trajectories.

Result: Validated on the PPMI dataset, CNODE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting PD progression.

Conclusion: CNODE offers a promising solution for continuous, individualized PD progression forecasting, enhancing mechanistic insight and treatment development.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

### [119] [Causal Structure and Representation Learning with Biomedical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04790)
*Caroline Uhler,Jiaqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need to combine representation learning with causal inference to improve understanding and decision-making from massive data, especially in biomedical contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of representation learning in causal tasks, despite its success in predictive tasks, and the potential of multi-modal data to address these gaps.

Method: The authors propose a statistical and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning, leveraging observational and perturbational data.

Result: The framework aims to improve causal discovery, learn causal variables from multi-modal data, and design optimal perturbations.

Conclusion: The integration of representation learning and causal inference is crucial for advancing understanding and decision-making in complex systems, particularly in biomedicine.

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of
complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning
has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning
latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring
any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely
successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including
predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage
between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity
in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data
(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the
single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical
and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning
motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use
observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed
causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal
variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

*Chaymae Yahyati,Ismail Lamaakal,Khalid El Makkaoui,Ibrahim Ouahbi,Yassine Maleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SiFEN is a learned finite-element network using piecewise-polynomial predictors on a simplicial mesh, offering explicit locality, smoothness control, and efficiency. It matches or outperforms MLPs and KANs in various tasks while being interpretable and theory-backed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to dense MLPs and edge-spline networks with controllable smoothness and explicit locality.

Method: Uses degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials on a learned simplicial mesh with end-to-end training, shape regularization, semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips.

Result: Achieves classic FEM approximation rates, outperforms MLPs and KANs in tasks like tabular regression/classification, improves calibration, and reduces inference latency.

Conclusion: SiFEN is a theoretically grounded, efficient, and interpretable solution for various approximation tasks, offering advantages over traditional dense networks.

Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial
predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field
on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query
activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric
coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and
cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with
a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization,
semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard
shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic
FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic
approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head
on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter
budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency
due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and
edge-spline networks.

*Yushu Zhao,Zheng Wang,Minjia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PuzzleMoE efficiently compresses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by 50% without training, maintaining accuracy and improving inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High memory overhead in MoE models limits deployment; existing compression methods suffer performance drops at high ratios.

Method: Sparse expert merging with dual-mask for redundancy/specialization and bit-packed encoding for efficient inference.

Result: Compresses MoE by 50%, outperforms prior methods by 16.7% on MMLU at 50% compression, and achieves 1.28× speedup.

Conclusion: PuzzleMoE offers a training-free, high-performance compression solution for MoE models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling
language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per
input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high
memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as
the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have
explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from
performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high
accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE
performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy
and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and
expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary
masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses
underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up
to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it
outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%
compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

*Matthew D. Kvalheim,Eduardo D. Sontag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the topological constraints and capabilities of autoencoders in mapping data manifolds to latent spaces and back, and their use in dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inherent topological challenges and potential of autoencoders, especially when applied to dynamical systems with invariant manifolds.

Method: The study involves analyzing continuous maps (encoder and decoder) in autoencoders and their approximation of the identity map on a data manifold.

Result: The paper identifies topological limitations and capabilities in the design of autoencoders, particularly for dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Autoencoders have specific topological constraints, but they can be effectively used for dynamical systems with invariant manifolds.

Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space"
$\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an
"encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon
\mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is
as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present
various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an
autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems
having $M$ as an invariant manifold.

### [123] [Sharp Minima Can Generalize: A Loss Landscape Perspective On Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04808)
*Raymond Fan,Bryce Sandlund,Lin Myat Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning's effectiveness is often attributed to flat minima, but the role of large datasets in generalization is unclear. Research shows sharp minima can generalize well but are rare; large datasets make these minima more accessible by expanding their relative volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large datasets improve generalization in deep learning, challenging the traditional 'flat minima' hypothesis.

Method: Measure minima volumes in the loss landscape under varying amounts of training data.

Result: Sharp minima generalize well but are rare; large datasets make these minima more likely by increasing their relative volume.

Conclusion: Large datasets reshape the loss landscape, making beneficial minima more accessible, which complements the flat minima hypothesis.

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is
likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima
generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in
generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data
reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found
due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such
that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like fragmented datasets and inconsistent annotations slowing down antimicrobial peptide discovery.

Method: Integration of over 80,000 peptides into ESCAPE, followed by a transformer-based model leveraging sequence and structural data.

Result: 2.56% relative improvement in mean Average Precision over existing methods.

Conclusion: ESCAPE provides a reproducible framework to advance AI-driven antimicrobial peptide research.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat
antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent
annotations, and the lack of standardized benchmarks hinder computational
approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these
challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial
Peptide Evaluation (ESCAPE), an experimental framework integrating over 80.000
peptides from 27 validated repositories. Our dataset separates antimicrobial
peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations
into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across
antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on
ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and
structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides.
Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average
Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new
state-of-the-art multilabel peptide classification. ESCAPE provides a
comprehensive and reproducible evaluation framework to advance AI-driven
antimicrobial peptide research.

TL;DR: Persistent reachability homology (PRH) outperforms directed flag complex-based persistent homology (DPH) in classifying epilepsy detection networks using Betti curves and SVM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the effectiveness of PRH in network classification tasks, specifically for epilepsy detection, and compare it with traditional DPH.

Method: PRH is applied to digraph data, utilizing condensations for smaller digraphs, and topological features are derived from Betti curves and their integrals. A support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification.

Result: PRH demonstrates superior performance over DPH in the classification task.

Conclusion: PRH is an effective tool for topological analysis in network classification, particularly for epilepsy detection.

Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of
digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study
the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience
problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of
digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main
advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs
appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller
digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that
PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and
their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support
vector machine.

*Jiwoo Shin,Byeonghu Na,Mina Kang,Wonhyeok Choi,Il-chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to improve defense against harmful content in text-to-image models by replacing negative prompts with implicit negative embeddings via concept inversion, without modifying existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the incompatibility and degraded performance when combining fine-tuning and training-free methods to prevent harmful content generation in text-to-image models.

Method: Proposes replacing negative prompts in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion, ensuring compatibility with fine-tuning.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements in defense success rate against nudity and violence benchmarks while preserving input prompt semantics.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the gap between fine-tuning and training-free approaches, enhancing defense without altering existing pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about
their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input
text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1)
fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free
guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that
combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even
degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical
incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined
effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually
simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in
training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through
concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and
can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate
its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent
improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of
input prompts.

*Matthew S. Zhang,Stephen Huan,Jerry Huang,Nicholas M. Boffi,Sitan Chen,Sinho Chewi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDRaM, a new integrator for DDPMs, achieving sublinear complexity for sample generation, improving upon prior linear dependence on dimension or initial Fisher information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior analyses of DDPMs relied on exponential Euler discretization, leading to linear dependencies on dimensions or initial Fisher information. The goal was to develop a more efficient method with sublinear complexity.

Method: The proposed DDRaM leverages a randomized midpoint to approximate the SDE, analyzed using the shifted composition rule framework under smoothness assumptions.

Result: DDRaM achieves sublinear O~(√d) score evaluations for convergence, a first for pure DDPM sampling, validated by experiments with pre-trained image models.

Conclusion: DDRaM offers a practical and theoretically sound improvement over traditional DDPM methods, with better efficiency and performance in real-world tasks.

Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior
analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization,
showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or
initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and
Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized
midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to
better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework
called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys
favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions,
with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure
convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM
sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with
ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate
from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of
the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with
pre-trained image synthesis models.

*Jingchen Bi,Rodrigo Mesa-Arango*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uses machine learning to analyze consumer preferences for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the U.S., finding a strong preference for safety and energy-related certificates, and provides recommendations for supply chain improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transportation factors, identified as significant in prior research, influence consumer food purchasing choices and to pinpoint specific transportation attributes valued by consumers.

Method: A machine learning model was applied to data from a preference experiment that incorporated five innovative transportation certificates (Transportation Mode, IoT, Safety, Energy Source, MABDs), along with product-specific and decision-maker factors.

Result: Consumers showed a notable preference for safety and energy certificates in the U.S. food supply chain. The study also identified the impact of price, product type, certificates, and decision-maker factors on purchasing choices.

Conclusion: The study provides data-driven insights for enhancing food supply chain systems by focusing on consumer-preferred transportation attributes like safety and energy efficiency.

Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's
behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the
U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with
supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation
factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices.
Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific
transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was
applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were
proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures,
Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also
incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes.
The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates
within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally,
the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and
decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers
data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

*Arthur Chen,Zuxin Liu,Jianguo Zhang,Akshara Prabhakar,Zhiwei Liu,Shelby Heinecke,Silvio Savarese,Victor Zhong,Caiming Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM agents struggle with novel environments due to syntactic and semantic misunderstandings. The paper proposes two adaptation strategies: online distributional adaptation and deployment-time dynamics grounding, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents fail to generalize to new environments because their pre-training doesn't align with test-time conditions, leading to misunderstandings of environment-specific features and dynamics.

Method: Two strategies are proposed: 1) online distributional adaptation for aligning with environment response formats, and 2) deployment-time dynamics grounding to learn causal dynamics before task execution.

Result: Both strategies improve performance across benchmarks with minimal cost, especially dynamics grounding in complex environments (e.g., increasing success from 2% to 23% in WebArena).

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance LLM agents' adaptability, addressing pre-training and test-time mismatches, paving the way for more generalizable agents.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and
complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to
a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.
This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic
misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,
and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only
revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and
complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging
environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online
distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by
learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output
distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.
Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven
exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal
dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world
model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,
including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the
effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal
computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective
in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,
demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based
agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases
the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

TL;DR: SigmaDock introduces a fragmentation scheme and SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model to improve molecular docking, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like chemically implausible outputs, poor generalizability, and high computational cost in generative molecular docking approaches.

Method: A novel fragmentation scheme decomposes ligands into rigid-body fragments, combined with SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model for pose generation.

Result: Achieves 79.9% Top-1 success rate on the PoseBusters set, outperforming recent deep learning and classical physics-based methods.

Conclusion: SigmaDock represents a significant advancement in deep learning for molecular docking, surpassing classical methods in reliability and feasibility.

Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular
docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise
faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,
but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor
generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from
structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building
on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion
model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within
the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock
exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex
diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show
SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates
(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%
reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent
generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning
approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test
split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of
deep learning for molecular modelling.

Motivation: To address the challenges of continuous-action reinforcement learning by reducing qubit requirements while maintaining model expressiveness.

Method: Introduces Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (CSQBMs), combining exponential-family priors for visible units and quantum Boltzmann distributions for hidden units.

Result: Enables analytical gradient computation for continuous variables and a stable Q-learning framework by replacing global maximization with efficient sampling.

Conclusion: CSQBMs provide a hybrid quantum-classical solution that enhances continuous control in reinforcement learning while improving stability and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By
combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann
distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model
that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness.
Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed
analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms.
Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces
global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby
overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

*Esha Sharma,Lauren Davis,Julie Ivy,Min Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoodRL, a reinforcement learning-based metalearning framework, improves food bank donation forecasting by dynamically adjusting models, outperforming traditional methods and enhancing resource distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting models struggle with the volatility of in-kind donations and concept drift caused by seasonal changes and natural disasters, impacting food banks' resource distribution.

Method: Proposed FoodRL uses reinforcement learning to cluster and dynamically weight diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and contextual data.

Result: FoodRL outperforms baseline methods, especially during disruptions, enabling the redistribution of food equivalent to 1.7 million additional meals annually.

Conclusion: FoodRL demonstrates significant social impact and adaptability for humanitarian supply chains, offering a reliable solution for food bank forecasting challenges.

Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their
effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind
donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional
forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to
unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and
natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in
the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and
dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and
contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally
distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by
wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by
hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly
during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and
adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent
to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant
potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for
humanitarian supply chains.

*Di Chen,Jia Li,Michael Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores whether self-interested autonomous vehicles (AVs) can benefit mixed autonomy traffic systems using collective rationality (CR) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AVs, even when acting selfishly, can improve traffic performance without explicit system-level goals.

Method: Uses DRL with a simple reward design to train driving agents and analyzes CR emergence in various scenarios.

Result: CR consistently emerges, showing robustness, and a mechanism explains its occurrence in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Advanced learning methods like federated learning could enable collective cooperation among self-interested AVs.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the
near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and
human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can
be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating
system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the
benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to
all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand
whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed
autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective
rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral
economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when
pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of
CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed
human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained
among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic
agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.
Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates
the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the
emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based
on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging
advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective
cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores label-free reinforcement learning (RL) in smaller language models, finding it highly dependent on the model's pre-existing reasoning. Proposed curriculum learning and data curation methods improve performance across sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored generalizability of label-free RL methods in smaller models with limited reasoning capabilities and enhance their unsupervised reasoning.

Method: Combines curriculum learning for progressively harder problems and masks no-majority rollouts during training, along with a data curation pipeline for difficulty-controlled samples.

Result: Label-free RL's success depends on the base model's reasoning; smaller models struggle. Proposed methods improve performance across model sizes (0.5B to 7B parameters).

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust path for unsupervised RL to bootstrap reasoning in resource-constrained models, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning
capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of
these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning
capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and
reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals
critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's
pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below
baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate
sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective
self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in
determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet
effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to
progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority
rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline
to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates

### [135] [Efficient Swap Multicalibration of Elicitable Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04907)
*Lunjia Hu,Haipeng Luo,Spandan Senapati,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces swap multicalibration for elicitable properties and proposes an oracle-efficient algorithm achieving improved error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize multicalibration from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis classes and improve error bounds in the online setting.

Method: Introduces swap multicalibration and uses an oracle-efficient algorithm with an online agnostic learner for bounded hypothesis classes.

Result: Achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$ $ℓ_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability, significantly improving prior bounds.

Conclusion: The work resolves an open question and provides a strongly affirmative answer to achieving oracle-efficient multicalibration.

Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that
demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on
themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups
of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between
multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and
property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if
it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property
value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over
the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient
algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a
hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property
$\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property
$\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis
classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following
[GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when
given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$
$\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a
hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an
elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap
multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously
established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely
resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean
multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

### [136] [A Dual Perspective on Decision-Focused Learning: Scalable Training via Dual-Guided Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04909)
*Paula Rodriguez-Diaz,Kirk Bansak Elisabeth Paulson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual-Guided Loss (DGL) simplifies decision-focused learning for combinatorial problems by using dual variables to align predictions with decisions, reducing solver dependence and training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability challenges in decision-focused learning due to frequent solver calls motivate the need for a simpler, solver-independent method like DGL.

Method: DGL leverages dual variables from downstream problems to shape learning, decoupling optimization from gradient updates and using dual-adjusted targets with surrogate losses.

Result: DGL matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer solver calls and less training time, proven to have diminishing decision regret.

Conclusion: DGL offers a scalable, efficient alternative for decision-focused learning in combinatorial problems while maintaining strong decision alignment.

Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization
problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has
motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how
the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream
decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art
methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific
surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,
often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the
downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a
simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing
solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection
problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and
shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by
solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains
on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)
as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard
supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that
DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,
and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art
DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training
time. Code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/Dual-Guided-Learning.

predictive analytics or make decisions in the fields of the data. In this
paper, we study some ML and statistical model connections to understand ways in
which some modern ML algorithms help 'enrich' conventional models; we

robustness of the traditional models. It shows that the hybrid models are of
great improvement in predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability

### [138] [Leak@$k$: Unlearning Does Not Make LLMs Forget Under Probabilistic Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04934)
*Hadi Reisizadeh,Jiajun Ruan,Yiwei Chen,Soumyadeep Pal,Sijia Liu,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current unlearning methods in LLMs fail to ensure true forgetting, as sensitive information often resurfaces under probabilistic decoding, revealed by the new metric leak@k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for regulatory compliance and ethical AI by ensuring LLMs can effectively forget sensitive, private, or harmful information.

Method: Introduces leak@k, a metric to evaluate knowledge leakage under probabilistic decoding, and tests it across three benchmarks (TOFU, MUSE, WMDP) to assess unlearning reliability.

Result: Most existing unlearning methods fail to achieve true forgetting, with knowledge leakage persisting across methods and tasks.

Conclusion: Current unlearning techniques are insufficient, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to ensure reliable forgetting in LLMs.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory
compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing
private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in
this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to
achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these
`unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest
successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the
literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models
are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this
vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric
that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when
generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies.
Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the
first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly
defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge
leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current
state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and
highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

*Zhankun Luo,Abolfazl Hashemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the EM algorithm's structural properties and convergence for two-component Mixed Linear Regression with unknown weights and parameters, revealing cycloid trajectories and non-asymptotic guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical behavior of EM for mixed linear regression with unknown weights and parameters remains unclear, prompting a detailed analysis of its trajectories and convergence.

Method: Explicit EM update expressions are derived for all SNR regimes, with trajectory analysis quantifying convergence order (linear or quadratic) based on sub-optimality angles.

Result: In noiseless cases, EM traces cycloid trajectories; convergence is linear for near-orthogonal estimates and quadratic for small angles. Non-asymptotic guarantees are established.

Conclusion: The study introduces a trajectory-based framework for EM analysis in mixed linear regression, clarifying convergence behavior and providing statistical error bounds.

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing
weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global
convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence
in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the
theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with
its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive
explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and
regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural
properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the
trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by
establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high
SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The
trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM
estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle
between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our
analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on
statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating
EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence
with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a
novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Motivation: To address the growing prevalence of diabetes and its link to CVD by improving risk prediction accuracy.

Method: Preprocessed BRFSS data, used PCA for feature extraction, and tested ML (DT, RF, KNN, SVM, AdaBoost, XGBoost) and DL (ANN, DNN, RNN, CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU) models, including hybrid combinations.

Result: XGBoost and LSTM achieved the highest accuracy (0.9050), with some DL models achieving perfect recall (1.00).

Conclusion: ML and DL models effectively predict CVD risk in diabetic patients, enhancing clinical decision-making and personalized risk management.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is crucial for
healthcare institutions. This study addresses the growing prevalence of
diabetes and its strong link to heart disease by proposing an efficient CVD
risk prediction model for diabetic patients using machine learning (ML) and
hybrid deep learning (DL) approaches. The BRFSS dataset was preprocessed by
removing duplicates, handling missing values, identifying categorical and
numerical features, and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature
extraction. Several ML models, including Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest
(RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and
XGBoost, were implemented, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy of
0.9050. Various DL models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep
Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as hybrid models combining CNN with LSTM,
BiLSTM, and GRU, were also explored. Some of these models achieved perfect
recall (1.00), with the LSTM model achieving the highest accuracy of 0.9050.
Our research highlights the effectiveness of ML and DL models in predicting CVD
risk among diabetic patients, automating and enhancing clinical
decision-making. High accuracy and F1 scores demonstrate these models'

*Siyuan Li,Yifan Sun,Lei Cheng,Lewen Wang,Yang Liu,Weiqing Liu,Jianlong Li,Jiang Bian,Shikai Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAR-TS is a fast, flexible framework for generating multivariate time series by combining disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer, outperforming slower diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based generative models for time series are slow and limited to fixed-length windows, necessitating a faster, more flexible solution.

Method: FAR-TS uses disentangled factorization to decompose time series into static cross-channel correlations and temporal coefficients, which are then quantized into discrete tokens. An autoregressive Transformer models these tokens for controllable generation.

Result: FAR-TS generates time series orders-of-magnitude faster than Diffusion-TS, maintains cross-channel correlations, and offers an interpretable latent space.

Conclusion: FAR-TS provides a fast, high-quality, and flexible solution for time series generation, addressing limitations of existing diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling
high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

*Gimun Bae,Seung Jun Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROC-SVM maximizes AUC but is computationally expensive. A scalable variant using incomplete U-statistics and low-rank kernel approximation achieves similar performance with reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the high computational cost of the original ROC-SVM, making it practical for large-scale datasets.

Method: Develops a scalable variant using incomplete U-statistics and extends it to nonlinear classification via low-rank kernel approximation.

Result: Achieves comparable AUC performance to ROC-SVM with significantly reduced training time.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, making ROC-SVM more practical.

Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the
conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance.
However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training
involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a
scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby
substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the
framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation,
enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical
analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation,
and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM
with drastically reduced training time.

Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between high-performing 'black box' ML models and the explainability required by financial regulators, enabling their use in regulated environments.

Method: The authors apply LIME and SHAP to various models, comparing their explainability, and introduce a five-dimensional framework (Inherent Interpretability, Global Explanations, Local Explanations, Consistency, Complexity) for nuanced evaluation.

Result: The study shows that complex models can achieve comparable explainability to simpler ones using SHAP and LIME, and provides a structured method to evaluate trade-offs between performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: The research concludes that sophisticated ML models can be feasibly used in regulated financial settings with modern explainability techniques, offering a balanced approach to performance and interpretability.

Abstract: The financial industry faces a significant challenge modeling and risk
portfolios: balancing the predictability of advanced machine learning models,
neural network models, and explainability required by regulatory entities (such
as Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau). This paper intends to fill the gap in the application between these
"black box" models and explainability frameworks, such as LIME and SHAP.
Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models
and demonstrates the more complex models with better prediction powers could be
applied and reach the same level of the explainability, using SHAP and LIME.
Beyond the comparison and discussion of performances, this paper proposes a
novel five dimensional framework evaluating Inherent Interpretability, Global
Explanations, Local Explanations, Consistency, and Complexity to offer a
nuanced method for assessing and comparing model explainability beyond simple
accuracy metrics. This research demonstrates the feasibility of employing
sophisticated, high performing ML models in regulated financial environments by
utilizing modern explainability techniques and provides a structured approach
to evaluate the crucial trade offs between model performance and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Progressive training scales model depth efficiently, saving 80% compute while matching loss of full-depth models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deeper models improve accuracy but increase computational cost; progressive training addresses this tradeoff.

Method: Zero/one-layer progressive training for optimal compute-loss balance, with insights on initialization, hyperparameters, and scheduling.

Result: Saves ≈80% compute (≈5× acceleration) on GPT2, achieving similar loss to a 60-layer, 7B-parameter model.

Conclusion: Progressive training is a viable strategy for efficient large-model training without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve
higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train
models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which
scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing
computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study
the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and
feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers,
hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.
Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal
tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive
training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate
$\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully
trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the neglect of endogenous protein-peptide interactions in AI-driven drug design, Peptide2Mol aims to improve molecule generation.

Method: Uses an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model trained on large datasets, leveraging peptide binders and protein pocket environments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generative tasks, produces peptide-similar molecules, and enables optimization via partial diffusion.

Conclusion: Peptide2Mol is an effective deep generative model for bioactive small molecule generation and optimization.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design has seen significant advancements with the
integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the generation of
hit and lead compounds. However, most AI-driven approaches neglect the
importance of endogenous protein interactions with peptides, which may result
in suboptimal molecule designs. In this work, we present Peptide2Mol, an
E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small
molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their
surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and
leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also
produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder.
Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic
design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol
as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive
small molecules from protein binding pockets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework combining structural break detection, wavelet denoising, and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, TCN) to improve carbon price forecasting, achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate carbon price forecasting is crucial for energy markets and decarbonization, but current methods face challenges due to structural breaks and noise.

Method: Integrates Bai-Perron, ICSS, PELT algorithms for break detection, wavelet denoising, and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, TCN) using EUA spot price data.

Result: PELT-WT-TCN outperforms baselines, reducing RMSE by 22.35% and MAE by 18.63% compared to best baseline, and by 70.55% and 74.42% vs. original LSTM.

Conclusion: Combining structural awareness and multiscale decomposition enhances accuracy and interpretability in forecasting nonstationary financial time series.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiPETE, a transformer-based model with dual positional embeddings, improves disease risk prediction in EHR data without large-scale pretraining, outperforming baselines by 34% and 50% in two cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of temporal dependencies in EHR data for disease risk prediction, especially with irregular visit intervals.

Method: Proposes BiPETE, integrating rotary and sinusoidal positional embeddings for relative timing and visit order.

Result: BiPETE significantly outperforms baselines, with AUPRC improvements of 34% and 50%. Integrated Gradients reveal key clinical features.

Conclusion: BiPETE offers a practical, interpretable framework for disease risk prediction, enhancing understanding of risk factors.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

*Dongsu Lee,Daehee Lee,Amy Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAC-Flow is a framework for multi-agent coordination that balances rich behavioral representation and fast execution by using flow-based learning and decentralized policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective coordination requires both rich representation of joint behaviors and efficient real-time action, but existing methods often compromise one for the other.

Method: MAC-Flow learns a flow-based representation of joint behaviors and distills it into decentralized one-step policies.

Result: MAC-Flow achieves ~14.5x faster inference than diffusion-based methods while maintaining performance and matches the speed of Gaussian policy-based methods.

Conclusion: MAC-Flow successfully addresses the trade-off between performance and computational cost in multi-agent coordination.

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for
multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination
are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present
in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,
prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising
diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally
slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling
multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a
flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into
decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast
execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and
$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and
computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$
faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining
good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of
prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
methods.

*Dongjin Park,Hasung Yeo,Joon-Woo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OvA-LP is a minimalist framework designed to suppress drift in federated fine-tuning by combining linear probing with a one-vs-all head, outperforming baselines under extreme non-IID conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fragility of federated fine-tuning under heterogeneous client distributions by tackling local drift at its source.

Method: Uses linear probing on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a two-stage procedure to decouple logits and preserve pretrained feature geometry.

Result: Retains 95.9% of IID accuracy on CIFAR-100 under extreme non-IID conditions, significantly outperforming baselines (10.1% and 34.5%).

Conclusion: OvA-LP offers a principled and efficient solution for robust federated fine-tuning under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data
but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local
drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and
amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and
personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle
under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework
that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at
its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing
on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure,
preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the
mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over
shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of
its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1%
(PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains
resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition,
precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of
encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a
principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuAnTS, a novel dataset for Question Answering on Time Series (TSQA) data, focusing on human motion via skeleton trajectories. It validates QuAnTS' quality and evaluates baselines to advance TSQA research, aiming to improve interactions with time series models through text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA research largely overlooks time series data. The authors address this gap by creating QuAnTS to enhance accessibility and decision-making via textual interactions with time series models.

Method: The authors propose QuAnTS, a TSQA dataset featuring diverse questions/answers on human motion skeleton trajectories. They validate its comprehensiveness through experiments and evaluate baselines.

Result: QuAnTS is verified as well-formed and comprehensive. Baseline evaluations and human performance metrics are provided to guide future TSQA research.

Conclusion: QuAnTS bridges a critical gap in TSQA research, encouraging further work on text-based interactions with time series models for better decision-making and transparency.

Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular,
complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved
interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and
decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models
has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question
answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention.
To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA)
dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we
pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of
tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is
well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly
evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a
deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human
performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such
models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series
models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the connection between neural network output layer activation functions (e.g., linear, sigmoid, ReLU, softmax) and loss functions (e.g., MSE, MAE, Cross-Entropy) through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), linking them to Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). It also discusses practical scenarios like output encodings and heavy-tailed distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a statistical justification for selecting appropriate loss functions based on activation functions and their underlying probability distributions.

Method: Analyzes common activation functions (linear, sigmoid, ReLU, softmax) and their mathematical properties, connecting them to loss functions via MLE and GLMs.

Result: Demonstrates that choosing a loss function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for model outputs, clarifying their statistical basis.

Conclusion: The selection of loss functions should align with the activation function and its statistical properties, ensuring optimal training and performance of deep learning models.

Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its
output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes
common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear,
sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their
appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the
selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model.
This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE),
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical
principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss
function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the
model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized
Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios
of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output
encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Consecutive Preferential Bayesian Optimization (CPBO), addressing production and evaluation costs in preference-based optimization while incorporating perceptual ambiguity feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore production and evaluation costs in preference-based optimization, leading to inefficiencies. The paper aims to reduce costs and improve accuracy by leveraging previously generated candidates and accounting for perceptual ambiguity.

Method: The authors generalize preference-based optimization by constraining comparisons to involve existing candidates and incorporating a Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model. They use an information-theoretic acquisition strategy to select optimal configurations.

Result: Empirical results show significant accuracy improvements in high-cost setups or with indifference feedback.

Conclusion: CPBO effectively reduces production costs and enhances optimization accuracy by addressing perceptual ambiguity and leveraging prior candidates.

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are
either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal
number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate
solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by
existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly
account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential
Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to
involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual
ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a
Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to
capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an
information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new
configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a
preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically
demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs
or with indifference feedback.

*Frauke Andersen,William Rudman,Ruochen Zhang,Carsten Eickhoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Accelerated Path Patching (APP) combines Contrastive-FLAP pruning and traditional Path Patching to reduce circuit discovery search space and improve efficiency while maintaining circuit performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circuit discovery methods like Path Patching are computationally expensive and limit analysis for smaller models. APP aims to address this efficiency gap.

Method: APP uses Contrastive-FLAP pruning to reduce the search space by 56%, followed by Path Patching on remaining heads, achieving speed-ups of 59.63%-93.27%.

Result: APP reduces computation significantly while preserving circuit overlap and performance similar to traditional Path Patching.

Conclusion: APP offers a computationally efficient alternative to Path Patching without compromising circuit quality.

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability
pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally
expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In
this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach
leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically
reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP
pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign
higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher
performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although
Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing
pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by
Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint
required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the
search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%.
Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,
leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to
the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP
provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar
performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and lab biomarkers outperforms unimodal methods in predicting PFS for PRRT-treated NET patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting PFS could improve individualized treatment planning for metastatic NETs.

Method: Retrospective study of 116 patients, comparing unimodal (lab, SR-PET, CT) and multimodal deep learning models.

Result: Multimodal fusion model achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.72).

Conclusion: Multimodal models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies for PRRT-treated NET patients.

Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated
patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with
metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch
- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).
Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers
outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external
validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NatureLM, a foundation model for bioacoustics, shows strong performance but struggles with complex prompts. Merging it with its base model improves flexibility without losing expertise, enhancing zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between domain-specific performance and instruction-following flexibility in NatureLM, ensuring broader usability.

Method: A simple model merging strategy interpolating NatureLM with its base language model.

Result: Recovered instruction-following capabilities, minimal domain expertise loss, and 200% relative improvement in zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: Model merging enhances NatureLM's flexibility and zero-shot performance, setting a new benchmark for unseen species classification.

Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent
a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most
prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong
performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces
trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM
achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name
individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a
single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that
interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering
instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.
Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot
generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new
state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

### [157] [Associative Poisoning to Generative Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05177)
*Mathias Lundteigen Mohus,Jingyue Li,Zhirong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'associative poisoning,' a stealthy data poisoning technique targeting generative models like Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT. It manipulates feature associations without degrading output quality or requiring control over training. Theoretical and empirical results confirm its efficacy, highlighting vulnerabilities in generative systems and proposing a new defense strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative models has led to increased risks of malicious exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Current attacks either degrade performance or require impractical control over training. This work addresses the need for more subtle, real-world applicable poisoning methods.

Method: The paper proposes 'associative poisoning,' which perturbs training data to manipulate statistical associations in generated outputs. It includes a formal mathematical formulation and theoretical proofs of feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical tests on two generative models validate the attack's effectiveness.

Result: Associative poisoning successfully induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving output quality and evading detection. It compromises statistical integrity in applications like image synthesis and NLP, exposing vulnerabilities in generative systems.

Conclusion: The study reveals that generative models are susceptible to stealthy data poisoning. It suggests the need for improved defenses and introduces a novel countermeasure strategy to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and
ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious
exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks
compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of
generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data
poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises
fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the
training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate
statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated
outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove
its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two
state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning
effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the
marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality
outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that
generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and
natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations
that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine
the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel
countermeasure strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how different forecasting models perform under varying sensor densities and sampling frequencies, finding STGNNs effective for sparse deployments and TSFMs excelling at high frequencies but degrading with reduced spatial coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage impact downstream model performance in environmental sensing, as existing techniques overlook this interplay.

Method: A systematic study of forecasting models (VAR, GRU, Transformer, STGNNs, TSFMs) using real-world temperature data under varying spatial sensor densities and sampling intervals.

Result: STGNNs perform well with sparse deployments and moderate sampling rates, while TSFMs excel at high frequencies but suffer with reduced spatial coverage. Moirai outperforms others by learning cross-sensor dependencies.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for optimizing forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems, emphasizing model choice based on deployment conditions.

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume
spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically
powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic
deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook
how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream
model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from
additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.
This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different
forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a
systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural
networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),
and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under
varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world
temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are
effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,
leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for
limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies
but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.
Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively
learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights
for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All

TL;DR: A gradient approximation method reduces training costs for neural networks by using predicted gradients instead of full gradients, backed by control-variate techniques and Neural Tangent Kernel theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training neural networks is computationally expensive due to the backward pass. The paper aims to cut costs by approximating gradients.

Method: The method uses approximate predicted gradients and control-variate techniques to ensure unbiased updates, leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel theory for gradient prediction.

Result: Empirical tests on a vision transformer classification task demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed gradient approximation technique successfully reduces training costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a new way of training neural networks, with the goal of reducing
training cost. Our method uses approximate predicted gradients instead of the
full gradients that require an expensive backward pass. We derive a
control-variate-based technique that ensures our updates are unbiased estimates
of the true gradient. Moreover, we propose a novel way to derive a predictor
for the gradient inspired by the theory of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We
empirically show the efficacy of the technique on a vision transformer
classification task.

TL;DR: ActiTect is an automated, open-source machine learning tool for detecting REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) from actigraphy, validated across diverse cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iRBD is a key early marker of neurodegenerative diseases, but current methods lack reliable analysis pipelines. ActiTect aims to fill this gap with scalable RBD detection.

Method: The pipeline includes preprocessing, sleep-wake detection, and motion feature extraction. Developed on a cohort of 78, validated on local (n=31) and external (n=113, n=57) datasets.

Result: High discrimination (AUROC 0.95 in development, 0.84-0.94 in validation). Consistent performance across datasets (AUROC 0.84-0.89).

Conclusion: ActiTect is a robust, generalizable tool for RBD detection, promoting open-source collaboration and scalable screening.

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major
prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical
onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system
atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting
RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements,
they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This
study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool
to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across
heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing
and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract
physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns.
Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong
discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was
confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two
independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To
assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the
internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range
= 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive
features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled
multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By
being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and
facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby
advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model
using wearable devices.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BELM-MDCM, a diffusion-based framework addressing the Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE) in causal inference, ensuring faithful abduction through Causal Information Conservation (CIC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational challenge of inferring latent exogenous noise in Structural Causal Models (SCMs) using diffusion models, which traditionally lose information for causal tasks.

Method: Proposes BELM-MDCM with an analytically invertible mechanism, Targeted Modeling for regularization, and a Hybrid Training Objective to eliminate SRE.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and enables high-fidelity individual-level counterfactuals, bridging modern generative models with classical causal theory.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new standard for causal inference by combining generative models' power with rigorous causal principles.

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for
counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of
latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,
non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The
advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a
promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for
perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for
this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural
Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the
principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition
for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based
framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction
through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,
a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid
Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,
individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work
provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern
generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new
and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

TL;DR: A hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework solves the TSP-D problem efficiently, outperforming heuristics and existing RL methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the NP-hard complexity of TSP-D in truck-drone logistics for operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact.

Method: Proposes a Transformer-inspired encoder with k-nearest neighbors sparse attention and Minimal Gated Unit decoder within an Actor-Critic paradigm.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior solutions faster than benchmarks, with reduced training time and better performance.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant efficiency and effectiveness in solving TSP-D, advancing practical logistics applications.

Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.

TL;DR: Using data augmentation to reduce Membership Inference Attacks in time series forecasting without losing predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance privacy and performance in time series forecasting with EHR data by mitigating MIA.

Method: Explored retraining with synthetic data using ZOO, ZOO-PCA, and MixUp augmentation strategies.

Result: ZOO-PCA most effectively reduced MIA attack success (TPR/FPR ratio) without compromising test accuracy.

Conclusion: Data augmentation, especially ZOO-PCA, enhances privacy while maintaining forecasting performance.

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

*Jatin Prakash,Aahlad Puli,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAT introduces a simple architecture with dense attention and compression to balance quality and efficiency in transformers, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between compute/memory efficiency and quality in transformer models, especially for in-context recall.

Method: Uses dense attention and compression to decode chunks of tokens, allowing flexibility in quality-efficiency trade-offs.

Result: CAT outperforms baselines across budgets, matches dense transformers in quality, and reduces memory usage and latency.

Conclusion: CAT provides a simpler, adaptive solution for efficient transformers without compromising performance.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of
efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions
and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions
in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically
in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute
tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications
require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency
and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that
artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent
state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at
specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design
process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &
Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two
simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of
tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression
results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and
memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for
efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,
unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without
any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive

*Janet Jenq,Hongda Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method reverses typographic attacks by embedding relevant text on product images, improving multimodal retrieval accuracy in e-commerce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerability of vision-language models to typographic attacks by enhancing image-text alignment for better retrieval performance.

Method: Render relevant textual content (e.g., titles, descriptions) onto product images to strengthen alignment, tested on three datasets with six vision models.

Result: Consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval accuracy across categories and models.

Conclusion: Visually rendering product metadata is a simple, effective enhancement for zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce.

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on
effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance
and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are
vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded
in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that
reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content
(e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform
vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and
boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on
three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading
cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval
accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that
visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for
zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

*Jan-Hendrik Ewering,Robin E. Herrmann,Niklas Wahlström,Thomas B. Schön,Thomas Seel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian method for learning non-conservative Hamiltonian dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs) from input-output data, addressing the challenge of limited velocity/momentum data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorporating physical principles like energy conservation into learning models is crucial for physically consistent models, especially in scenarios like model-based control.

Method: Uses non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs with a fully Bayesian scheme to estimate hidden states, GP hyperparameters, and structural hyperparameters (e.g., damping coefficients). Employs reduced-rank GP approximation for computational efficiency.

Result: The method is evaluated in a nonlinear simulation and compared to a state-of-the-art approach relying on momentum measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively learns dynamics from input-output data, overcoming the limitation of requiring velocity/momentum data, while maintaining computational tractability.

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws,
in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent
models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work
incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical
principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is
rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with
non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem
setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme
for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP
hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping
coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take
advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for
computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is
evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a
state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAD-Flower improves FM by ensuring safe, admissible, and dynamically consistent trajectories using virtual control inputs and nonlinear control theory, outperforming baselines without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FM lacks guarantees for state/action constraints and dynamical consistency, risking safety and executability of trajectories.

Method: Augments FM with virtual control inputs, leveraging nonlinear control theory for formal guarantees on constraints and consistency.

Result: Outperforms generative-model-based baselines in constraint satisfaction across tasks.

Conclusion: SAD-Flower effectively addresses FM's limitations, ensuring safe and executable trajectories.

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning.
However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action
constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for
the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems.
Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which
potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by
proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and
Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of
the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be
derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal
guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency.
Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time
satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across
several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various
generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

Motivation: To bypass costly iterative optimization in electromagnetic inverse design and enable rapid generation of valid metasurface geometries.

Method: Uses a 1D U-Net with Feature-wise Linear Modulation trained on simulated metasurfaces to map scattering patterns to dielectric structures.

Result: Achieves median MPE below 19% (best: 1.39%) and reduces design time from hours to seconds, outperforming CMA-ES.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show promise for advancing electromagnetic inverse design, enabling faster development of photonic and wireless systems.

Abstract: We present a conditional diffusion model for electromagnetic inverse design
that generates structured media geometries directly from target differential
scattering cross-section profiles, bypassing expensive iterative optimization.
Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map
desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure,
naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse
valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves
median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES
evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds.
These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for
advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid
exploration of complex metasurface architectures and accelerating the
development of next-generation photonic and wireless communication systems. The

*Yiting He,Zhishuai Liu,Weixin Wang,Pan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of online off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL) in robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), introducing the supremal visitation ratio to measure dynamics mismatch and proposing an efficient algorithm with sublinear regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work often assumes access to generative models or pre-collected datasets, bypassing exploration challenges. This study tackles the realistic setting of online interaction with the training environment.

Method: The authors introduce the supremal visitation ratio and propose a computationally efficient algorithm for online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based uncertainties.

Result: The algorithm achieves sublinear regret, with matching lower bounds proving its optimal dependence on the supremal visitation ratio and interaction episodes.

Conclusion: The theoretical results are validated through numerical experiments, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in online RMDPs.

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment
transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust
Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are
imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models
allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good
state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of
exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting
where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.
To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we
introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the
mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show
that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We
propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear
regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We
also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm
achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the
number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through comprehensive numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A continual learning framework (ProDER) for smart grids effectively predicts faults with minimal accuracy drop in evolving environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-based fault prediction models lack reliability in adapting to new fault types and operational zones in smart grids.

Method: Proposed a continual learning framework (ProDER) combining prototype-based feature regularization, logit distillation, and prototype-guided replay memory, evaluated in four realistic scenarios.

Result: ProDER outperforms other CL techniques, with only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone prediction.

Conclusion: Continual learning is practical for scalable, real-world fault prediction in evolving smart grid environments.

Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational
challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly
critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure
reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new
fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual
learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together
with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in
class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid
conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay
(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based
feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay
memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with
only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone
prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,
real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of collaborative control policy learning in multiple systems under model uncertainty and adversarial corruption.

Method: A clustered multitask approach combining clustering, system identification, and resilient aggregation to handle adversarial corruption.

Result: Non-asymptotic bounds show regret decreases with the number of honest systems per cluster, remaining effective under bounded adversarial presence.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces regret in adversarial settings, demonstrating resilience and scalability in multitask control.

Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a
setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under
model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask
approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient
aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how
clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior
affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR
tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret
decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this
reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within
each cluster.

*Naveen Raj Manoharan,Hassan Iqbal,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient conditioning mechanism is proposed for Graph Network-based Simulators (GNS) to adapt to material parameters, focusing on early message-passing layers for improved generalization across materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNS models struggle to generalize across distinct material behaviors, limiting real-world applications. This work aims to enhance adaptability while reducing data requirements.

Method: A Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) conditioning mechanism targets early message-passing layers, requiring minimal fine-tuning and training data.

Result: The method achieves accurate long-term rollouts on unseen material parameters and handles inverse problems like identifying unknown cohesion from trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances GNS utility for inverse design and control tasks, reducing data needs and improving adaptability.

Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for
learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and
granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent
inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single
material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,
limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular
flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning
mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify
that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early
message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of
constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information
propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the
first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test
performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this
insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This
approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or
moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and
0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short
simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data
reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we
validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully
identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach
enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where
material properties are treated as design variables.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synapse, a novel arbitration framework for TSFMs, dynamically leverages diverse pre-trained models' strengths to improve forecasting accuracy across varied tasks and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained TSFMs show varied performance due to divergent training protocols and data sources, highlighting the need for effective arbitration to unify their complementary strengths.

Method: Thorough examination of TSFMs' specialized performance profiles and development of Synapse, which assigns adaptive weights and constructs forecasts by sampling model outputs.

Result: Synapse outperforms individual TSFMs and other ensembling techniques, proving its robustness in diverse forecasting settings.

Conclusion: Synapse's dynamic arbitration framework effectively harnesses TSFMs' complementary expertise, setting a new standard for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant
advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex
characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range
dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,
their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data
sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across
different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this
complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a
compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit
specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how
we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time
series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and
forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration
strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration
framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of
TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,
context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by
adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.
Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other
popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating
Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper derives a deterministic upper bound on the KL divergence for flow-matching distribution approximation, showing it scales with the L2 loss and achieves near-optimal efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical foundation for the statistical efficiency of flow-matching methods and compare their performance to diffusion models under the TV distance.

Method: Derives an explicit bound on KL divergence based on the L2 flow-matching loss, analyzing its dependence on data and velocity field regularities.

Result: The KL divergence is bounded by A1ε + A2ε², with constants dependent on data and velocity field properties. Flow matching achieves near-minimax-optimal efficiency.

Conclusion: Flow matching is statistically efficient, comparable to diffusion models under TV distance, with theoretical and numerical validation.

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular,
if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL
divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is
bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$
depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,
this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers
under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves
nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our
results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of
diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and
learned velocities corroborate our theory.

Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme stability is crucial for protein engineering and drug design, but existing methods fail to capture the coupling between sequence and structure.

Method: DGTN co-learns GNN weights and transformer attention through a bidirectional diffusion process, where structural embeddings guide attention and transformer representations refine GNN message passing.

Result: DGTN outperforms baselines on ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with a 6.2% improvement. Ablation studies show the diffusion mechanism contributes significantly.

Conclusion: DGTN provides a principled framework for integrating protein sequence and structure, with proven convergence and superior performance, advancing protein engineering and drug design.

Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic
stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While
recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence
and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate
coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We
present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that
co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and
transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a
bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings
guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2)
transformer representations refine GNN message passing through
attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis
showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds
than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves
state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with
6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion
mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis
proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling,
with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work
establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein

TL;DR: TUPANN is a satellite-only precipitation nowcasting model that decomposes forecasts into physically meaningful components, outperforming baselines in diverse climates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve short-term precipitation forecasts in regions lacking dense radar networks, especially areas vulnerable to climate extremes.

Method: Uses variational encoder-decoder for motion/intensity inference, lead-time-conditioned MaxViT for latent state evolution, and differentiable advection for frame reconstruction.

Result: Achieves top performance in most settings, with significant gains at higher precipitation thresholds. Training on multiple cities enhances results.

Conclusion: Physically aligned learning enables skillful, transferable, and globally applicable nowcasts.

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense
weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to
climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned
Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike
most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into
physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion
and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a
lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable
advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both
GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,
Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics
over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and
hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in
most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple
cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest
degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model
produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical
flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These
results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are
skillful, transferable and global.

TL;DR: SoilX is a calibration-free soil sensing system that measures six key components (M, N, P, K, C, Al) and eliminates texture-dependent recalibration, reducing errors by 23.8% to 31.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wireless soil sensing solutions require recalibration due to soil texture variations, limiting their practicality. SoilX addresses this by modeling organic carbon (C) and aluminosilicates (Al) explicitly.

Method: SoilX uses Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL) with Orthogonality Regularizer and Separation Loss to disentangle cross-component interference. It also features a tetrahedral antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism for robust permittivity measurement.

Result: SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5% compared to baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

Conclusion: SoilX provides a practical, calibration-free solution for precision agriculture by accurately measuring soil components without texture-dependent recalibration.

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil
moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil
sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current
solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to
handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and
organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce
SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key
components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX
eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates
Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the
Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle
cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral
antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure
soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%
over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-agent settings, missing vulnerabilities in multi-agent dynamics. TAMAS addresses this gap.

Method: TAMAS includes 300 adversarial instances across five scenarios, six attack types, and 211 tools, tested on ten LLMs and three interaction configurations.

Result: Multi-agent LLM systems are highly vulnerable to attacks, revealing critical failure modes.

Conclusion: TAMAS provides a foundation for improving safety in multi-agent LLM systems, emphasizing the need for stronger defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as
autonomous agents through tool use, planning, and decision-making abilities,
leading to their widespread adoption across diverse tasks. As task complexity
grows, multi-agent LLM systems are increasingly used to solve problems
collaboratively. However, safety and security of these systems remains largely
under-explored. Existing benchmarks and datasets predominantly focus on
single-agent settings, failing to capture the unique vulnerabilities of
multi-agent dynamics and co-ordination. To address this gap, we introduce
$\textbf{T}$hreats and $\textbf{A}$ttacks in $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent
$\textbf{S}$ystems ($\textbf{TAMAS}$), a benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness and safety of multi-agent LLM systems. TAMAS includes five distinct
scenarios comprising 300 adversarial instances across six attack types and 211
tools, along with 100 harmless tasks. We assess system performance across ten
backbone LLMs and three agent interaction configurations from Autogen and
CrewAI frameworks, highlighting critical challenges and failure modes in
current multi-agent deployments. Furthermore, we introduce Effective Robustness
Score (ERS) to assess the tradeoff between safety and task effectiveness of
these frameworks. Our findings show that multi-agent systems are highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses. TAMAS provides a foundation for systematically studying and improving
the safety of multi-agent LLM systems.

### [181] [Epistemic Reject Option Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04855)
*Vojtech Franc,Jakub Paplham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reject-option predictor that accounts for epistemic uncertainty in limited data scenarios, minimizing expected regret to abstain when training data is insufficient for reliable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reject-option models assume large training data makes epistemic uncertainty negligible, but this is unrealistic in many practical settings with limited data.

Method: The paper proposes an epistemic reject-option predictor using Bayesian learning to minimize expected regret and abstain in high epistemic uncertainty regions.

Result: The framework enables learning predictors that identify inputs where training data is insufficient, addressing a gap in existing methods.

Conclusion: This is the first principled approach to handle epistemic uncertainty in reject-option prediction, improving reliability in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

### [182] [DMA: Online RAG Alignment with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04880)
*Yu Bai,Yukai Miao,Dawei Wang,Li Chen,Fei Long,Rundi Zhai,Dan Li,Yanyu Ren,Tianfeng Liu,Hongtao Xie,Ce Yang,Xuhui Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA) improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by incorporating multi-granularity human feedback for real-time adaptation, outperforming static retrieval methods in both online and offline evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static retrieval in RAG systems limits adaptation to evolving user intent and content drift. The paper addresses this by proposing DMA to dynamically align retrieval with feedback.

Method: DMA integrates document-, list-, and response-level feedback into a learning pipeline, including supervised training, policy optimization, and knowledge distillation for low-latency serving.

Result: DMA shows significant improvements in human engagement during industrial deployment and outperforms baselines on conversational QA benchmarks (TriviaQA, HotpotQA).

Conclusion: DMA offers a principled, feedback-driven approach to real-time adaptation in RAG without compromising baseline retrieval performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

### [183] [Real-Time Reasoning Agents in Evolving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04898)
*Yule Wen,Yixin Ye,Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces real-time reasoning for agents in dynamic environments, proposes AgileThinker for balanced reasoning and response, and highlights challenges with current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world agents need to make timely decisions in dynamic environments, but existing language model approaches fail to address this.

Method: Proposes AgileThinker, combining reactive (rapid response) and planning (extended reasoning) paradigms, tested in Real-Time Reasoning Gym.

Result: AgileThinker outperforms single-paradigm agents under increasing task difficulty and time pressure.

Conclusion: Real-time reasoning is crucial for practical agents, and AgileThinker provides a foundation for future research in temporally constrained AI systems.

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

*Johan Schubert,Patrik Hansen,Pontus Hörling,Ronnie Johansson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A methodology for generating and evaluating action alternatives in military ground combat, focusing on mechanized battalions, to support decision-making with superior outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-making in military operations by systematically producing and assessing alternative courses of action.

Method: Generates thousands of action alternatives, evaluates them based on opponent status and actions, and refines options as conditions evolve.

Result: Produces revised courses of action for decision-makers within a sequential framework.

Conclusion: The approach enhances combat decision-making by dynamically adapting to evolving conditions and opponent actions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

### [185] [Cleaning Maintenance Logs with LLM Agents for Improved Predictive Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05311)
*Valeriu Dimidov,Faisal Hawlader,Sasan Jafarnejad,Raphaël Frank*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can help overcome challenges in predictive maintenance (PdM) by cleaning noisy maintenance logs, though domain-specific errors remain a hurdle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Economic constraints, dataset scarcity, and expertise shortages hinder PdM adoption in the automotive sector. LLMs offer a solution to accelerate PdM's transition from research to industry.

Method: Evaluated LLM-based agents on cleaning tasks involving six noise types in maintenance logs, a key data source for ML models.

Result: LLMs effectively handle generic cleaning tasks, showing promise for industrial applications, but struggle with domain-specific errors.

Conclusion: LLMs provide a foundation for PdM cleaning pipelines, with potential for further improvements via specialized training and enhanced agent capabilities.

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

### [186] [Reasoning Is All You Need for Urban Planning AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05375)
*Sijie Yang,Jiatong Li,Filip Biljecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework, leveraging reasoning AI to assist in urban planning by integrating cognitive layers and logic components, ensuring value-based, rule-grounded, and explainable decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of statistical learning in urban planning by enabling AI to reason transparently about constraints and stakeholder values, thus augmenting human planners.

Method: Proposes a framework with three cognitive layers (Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) and six logic components (Analysis, Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through multi-agent collaboration.

Result: Demonstrates the necessity of reasoning capabilities for planning decisions, presenting a comprehensive architecture with benchmark metrics and tackling research challenges.

Conclusion: The framework enhances human judgment in urban planning by systematically exploring solutions, ensuring compliance, and transparently evaluating trade-offs.

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.
