We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned\nNowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike\nmost deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into\nphysically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion\nand intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a\nlead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable\nadvection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both\nGOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,\nManaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics\nover 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and\nhybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in\nmost settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple\ncities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest\ndegradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes.
