### [1] [Knowledge-Guided Textual Reasoning for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07429)
*Hari Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TbVAD is a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection, using text-based reasoning for interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interpretable and knowledge-grounded anomaly detection without relying on explicit visual features.

Method: Transforms video content into captions, organizes them into semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and generates slot-wise explanations.

Result: Demonstrates reliable anomaly detection on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks.

Conclusion: TbVAD offers interpretable and effective anomaly detection for real-world surveillance.

Abstract: We introduce Text-based Explainable Video Anomaly Detection (TbVAD), a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. Unlike conventional WSVAD models that rely on explicit visual features, TbVAD represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

### [2] [Two Datasets Are Better Than One: Method of Double Moments for 3-D Reconstruction in Cryo-EM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07438)
*Joe Kileel,Oscar Mickelin,Amit Singer,Sheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoDM, a data fusion framework using second-order moments from two distinct orientation distributions for cryo-EM, proving unique structure determination and demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve molecular structure reconstruction in cryo-EM by leveraging diverse datasets under different experimental conditions.

Method: Develops MoDM, a convex-relaxation-based algorithm using second-order moments from uniform and unknown non-uniform orientation distributions.

Result: Shows that second-order moments uniquely determine structures (up to global rotation/reflection) and improves reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Leveraging dataset diversity enhances cryo-EM reconstruction, with MoDM providing accurate recovery using second-order statistics.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful imaging technique for reconstructing three-dimensional molecular structures from noisy tomographic projection images of randomly oriented particles. We introduce a new data fusion framework, termed the method of double moments (MoDM), which reconstructs molecular structures from two instances of the second-order moment of projection images obtained under distinct orientation distributions--one uniform, the other non-uniform and unknown. We prove that these moments generically uniquely determine the underlying structure, up to a global rotation and reflection, and we develop a convex-relaxation-based algorithm that achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics. Our results demonstrate the advantage of collecting and modeling multiple datasets under different experimental conditions, illustrating that leveraging dataset diversity can substantially enhance reconstruction quality in computational imaging tasks.

### [3] [Modulo Video Recovery via Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07479)
*Tianyu Geng,Feng Ji,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSViT is a novel Transformer-based deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction, outperforming standard HDR methods and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modulo cameras address dynamic range limitations by folding irradiance, but existing HDR methods fail for modulo recovery. Modern deep learning, especially Transformers, offers potential but requires adaptation.

Method: The paper introduces Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), leveraging token selection to focus on critical regions and capture global dependencies for folding resolution.

Result: SSViT successfully reconstructs high-quality videos from 8-bit folded inputs and sets new benchmarks in modulo video recovery.

Conclusion: SSViT represents a significant advancement in modulo recovery, demonstrating the effectiveness of Transformers for this task and surpassing traditional HDR approaches.

Abstract: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range, causing saturation in high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes. Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.

### [4] [Laplacian Score Sharpening for Mitigating Hallucination in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07496)
*Barath Chandran. C,Srinivas Anumasa,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a post-hoc adjustment using the Laplacian of the score function to reduce hallucinations in diffusion models, showing effectiveness across various data dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations (incoherent/unrealistic samples) in diffusion models caused by mode interpolation and score smoothening, without preventing their generation.

Method: Introduces a Laplacian-based post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference, using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator for higher dimensions.

Result: Demonstrates significant reduction in hallucinated samples across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed correction effectively mitigates hallucinations and explores the relationship between the Laplacian and score uncertainty.

Abstract: Diffusion models, though successful, are known to suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples. Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset. Furthermore, our analysis explores the relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.

### [5] [Toward the Frontiers of Reliable Diffusion Sampling via Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07499)
*Kwanyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASAG improves diffusion models by using adversarial cost in attention layers, enhancing output quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current guidance methods lack principled foundations and rely on manual distortions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ASAG disrupts attention scores via optimal transport and adversarial cost, reducing misleading alignments.

Result: ASAG improves sample quality in text-to-image diffusion and enhances controllability in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: ASAG is a lightweight, plug-and-play solution that boosts reliability without model retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance when using guidance methods such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enhance output quality by modifying the sampling trajectory. These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and improves reliability without requiring any model retraining.

### [7] [TrackStudio: An Integrated Toolkit for Markerless Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07624)
*Hristo Dimitrov,Giulia Dominijanni,Viktorija Pavalkyte,Tamar R. Makin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackStudio is an accessible, modular GUI-based pipeline for markerless motion tracking, combining open-source tools to simplify 2D/3D tracking, calibration, and visualization for non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in accessible, integrated solutions for markerless motion tracking, enabling non-experts to use reliable tracking tools without technical expertise.

Method: TrackStudio integrates established open-source tools into a single pipeline with automatic tracking, calibration, preprocessing, and visualization. It includes a user guide for setup and troubleshooting.

Result: Validated across 76 participants in diverse environments, TrackStudio achieved high inter-frame correlations (>0.98) and low triangulation errors (<13.6mm). It also extends to other body and face regions.

Conclusion: TrackStudio offers a practical, accessible solution for reliable markerless tracking, suitable for researchers and laypeople without specialist skills.

Abstract: Markerless motion tracking has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years and currently offers powerful opportunities for behavioural, clinical, and biomechanical research. While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.
  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.

### [8] [Predicting Coronary Artery Calcium Severity based on Non-Contrast Cardiac CT images using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07695)
*Lachlan Nguyen,Aidan Cousins,Arcot Sowmya,Hugh Dixson,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning CNN model was developed to classify coronary artery calcium scores into six clinical categories, showing high accuracy and agreement with semiautomatic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality, and current CAC scoring methods are time-consuming and require expert input. Automating this process could improve efficiency and scalability.

Method: A CNN model was trained on 68 patient scans with semiautomatic CAC scores as labels. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate performance.

Result: The model achieved high performance (96.5% accuracy, Cohen's kappa of 0.962), though it tended to overestimate CAC scores in some misclassifications.

Conclusion: The CNN model is viable for automating CAC scoring into six clinical categories, offering accuracy comparable to semiautomatic methods.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease causes high rates of mortality worldwide. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a powerful tool to stratify the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Current scoring practices require time-intensive semiautomatic analysis of cardiac computed tomography by radiologists and trained radiographers. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to classify the calcium score in cardiac, non-contrast computed tomography images into one of six clinical categories. A total of 68 patient scans were retrospectively obtained together with their respective reported semiautomatic calcium score using an ECG-gated GE Discovery 570 Cardiac SPECT/CT camera. The dataset was divided into training, validation and test sets. Using the semiautomatic CAC score as the reference label, the model demonstrated high performance on a six-class CAC scoring categorisation task. Of the scans analysed, the model misclassified 32 cases, tending towards overestimating the CAC in 26 out of 32 misclassifications. Overall, the model showed high agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.962), an overall accuracy of 96.5% and high generalisability. The results suggest that the model outputs were accurate and consistent with current semiautomatic practice, with good generalisability to test data. The model demonstrates the viability of a CNN model to stratify the calcium score into an expanded set of six clinical categories.

### [9] [FlowFeat: Pixel-Dense Embedding of Motion Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07696)
*Nikita Araslanov,Anna Sonnweber,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowFeat introduces a high-resolution, multi-task feature representation using novel motion profile distillation from optical flow networks and video data, enhancing state-of-the-art encoders for dense tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of low-resolution feature grids produced by current networks like transformers for dense prediction tasks.

Method: Developed FlowFeat, leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data for self-supervised training to approximate apparent motion statistically.

Result: FlowFeat significantly improves five state-of-the-art encoders and upsampling strategies in video object segmentation, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: FlowFeat advances reliable and versatile dense image representations, being computationally efficient and robust to flow estimation inaccuracies.

Abstract: Dense and versatile image representations underpin the success of virtually all computer vision applications. However, state-of-the-art networks, such as transformers, produce low-resolution feature grids, which are suboptimal for dense prediction tasks. To address this limitation, we present FlowFeat, a high-resolution and multi-task feature representation. The key ingredient behind FlowFeat is a novel distillation technique that embeds a distribution of plausible apparent motions, or motion profiles. By leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data, we develop an effective self-supervised training framework that statistically approximates the apparent motion. With its remarkable level of spatial detail, FlowFeat encodes a compelling degree of geometric and semantic cues while exhibiting high temporal consistency. Empirically, FlowFeat significantly enhances the representational power of five state-of-the-art encoders and alternative upsampling strategies across three dense tasks: video object segmentation, monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Training FlowFeat is computationally inexpensive and robust to inaccurate flow estimation, remaining highly effective even when using unsupervised flow networks. Our work takes a step forward towards reliable and versatile dense image representations.

### [10] [Cross Modal Fine-grained Alignment via Granularity-aware and Region-uncertain Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07710)
*Jiale Liu,Haoming Zhou,Yishu Zhu,Bingzhi Chen,Yuncheng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling with region-level uncertainty for fine-grained image-text alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in existing methods: poor generalization due to lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms and absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling.

Method: Uses modality-specific biases for salient features and represents regions as Gaussian mixtures to capture uncertainty.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Flickr30K and MS-COCO, improving robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: The unified approach effectively enhances fine-grained alignment by addressing key challenges.

Abstract: Fine-grained image-text alignment is a pivotal challenge in multimodal learning, underpinning key applications such as visual question answering, image captioning, and vision-language navigation. Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.

Result: UltraGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in PSNR (29.55), SSIM (0.89), and MSE (0.002) with real-time synthesis at 64.69 fps.

Conclusion: UltraGS outperforms existing methods, offering high-quality, real-time ultrasound image synthesis and an open-source dataset for future research.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a cornerstone of non-invasive clinical diagnostics, yet its limited field of view complicates novel view synthesis. We propose \textbf{UltraGS}, a Gaussian Splatting framework optimized for ultrasound imaging. First, we introduce a depth-aware Gaussian splatting strategy, where each Gaussian is assigned a learnable field of view, enabling accurate depth prediction and precise structural representation. Second, we design SH-DARS, a lightweight rendering function combining low-order spherical harmonics with ultrasound-specific wave physics, including depth attenuation, reflection, and scattering, to model tissue intensity accurately. Third, we contribute the Clinical Ultrasound Examination Dataset, a benchmark capturing diverse anatomical scans under real-world clinical protocols. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UltraGS's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art results in PSNR (up to 29.55), SSIM (up to 0.89), and MSE (as low as 0.002) while enabling real-time synthesis at 64.69 fps.

TL;DR: VectorSynth is a diffusion-based framework for synthesizing satellite images using polygonal geographic annotations with semantic attributes, enabling fine-grained, spatially grounded edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior models lacked dense cross-modal correspondences between imagery and semantic vector geometry, limiting fine-grained spatial edits.

Method: VectorSynth uses a vision language alignment module to create pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics, guiding conditional image generation.

Result: The framework outperforms prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism, demonstrating fine-grained spatial grounding.

Conclusion: VectorSynth enables interactive workflows for rapid simulations, edits, and map-informed content generation.

Abstract: We introduce VectorSynth, a diffusion-based framework for pixel-accurate satellite image synthesis conditioned on polygonal geographic annotations with semantic attributes. Unlike prior text- or layout-conditioned models, VectorSynth learns dense cross-modal correspondences that align imagery and semantic vector geometry, enabling fine-grained, spatially grounded edits. A vision language alignment module produces pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics; these embeddings guide a conditional image generation framework to respect both spatial extents and semantic cues. VectorSynth supports interactive workflows that mix language prompts with geometry-aware conditioning, allowing rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation. For training and evaluation, we assemble a collection of satellite scenes paired with pixel-registered polygon annotations spanning diverse urban scenes with both built and natural features. We observe strong improvements over prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism, and show that our trained vision language model demonstrates fine-grained spatial grounding. The code and data are available at https://github.com/mvrl/VectorSynth.

Result: Achieved 86.73% accuracy in classification and diagnostic scores exceeding 3/5, validated by clinicians.

Conclusion: Auto-US shows effectiveness and clinical potential for real-world ultrasound applications.

Abstract: AI-assisted ultrasound video diagnosis presents new opportunities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging analysis.

### [14] [Class Incremental Medical Image Segmentation via Prototype-Guided Calibration and Dual-Aligned Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07749)
*Shengqian Zhu,Chengrong Yu,Qiang Wang,Ying Song,Guangjun Li,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Zhang Yi,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGCD and DAPD methods address class incremental medical image segmentation challenges by refining distillation and alignment strategies to preserve old knowledge and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately preserve old-class knowledge during incremental learning, either by treating regions/channels uniformly or neglecting local representations in new data.

Method: PGCD uses prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate distillation intensity spatially, while DAPD aligns local prototypes with global and other local prototypes.

Result: The proposed methods surpass state-of-the-art techniques on multi-organ segmentation benchmarks, showcasing robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: PGCD and DAPD effectively mitigate knowledge degradation in CIMIS, enhancing old-class retention and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Class incremental medical image segmentation (CIMIS) aims to preserve knowledge of previously learned classes while learning new ones without relying on old-class labels. However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories. Comprehensive evaluations on two widely used multi-organ segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities.

### [15] [Beyond Randomness: Understand the Order of the Noise in Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07756)
*Song Yan,Min Li,Bi Xinliang,Jian Yang,Yusen Zhang,Guanye Xiong,Yunwei Lan,Tao Zhang,Wei Zhai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that initial noise in T2C diffusion models has analyzable semantic patterns, not just randomness. It proposes a 'Semantic Erasure-Injection' method to manipulate noise for better generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that noise is purely random in diffusion models and explore its semantic potential.

Method: Analyzes noise's role, introduces 'Semantic Erasure-Injection'—cleaning noise of unwanted semantics and injecting desired ones.

Result: Effective across T2C models (DiT and UNet), offering a universal tool for consistent generation.

Conclusion: Noise in diffusion models holds semantic value; manipulating it improves generation consistency without training.

Abstract: In text-driven content generation (T2C) diffusion model, semantic of generated content is mostly attributed to the process of text embedding and attention mechanism interaction. The initial noise of the generation process is typically characterized as a random element that contributes to the diversity of the generated content. Contrary to this view, this paper reveals that beneath the random surface of noise lies strong analyzable patterns. Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step "Semantic Erasure-Injection" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is consistently effective across various T2C models based on both DiT and UNet architectures and presents a novel perspective for optimizing the generation of diffusion model, providing a universal tool for consistent generation.

### [16] [Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing for Noisy Multi-Label Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07780)
*Likang Peng,Chao Su,Wenyuan Wu,Yuan Sun,Dezhong Peng,Xi Peng,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCBCH is a cross-modal hashing framework addressing label noise and partial semantic overlaps in multi-label datasets via semantic-consistent classification and bidirectional soft contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal hashing methods rely on fully annotated datasets and overlook label noise and partial semantic overlaps, degrading retrieval performance in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes SCBCH with two modules: Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC) for reducing noisy label impact, and Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH) for adaptive contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four cross-modal retrieval benchmarks under noisy multi-label conditions.

Conclusion: SCBCH effectively addresses label noise and semantic overlap challenges, enhancing robustness and generalization in cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.

*Runmin Cong,Anpeng Wang,Bin Wan,Cong Zhang,Xiaofei Zhou,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCDNet addresses cross-domain few-shot segmentation by decoupling features and dynamically fusing them, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder features often entangle domain and category information, limiting cross-domain generalization and adaptation.

Method: Proposes ACFD for feature decoupling, MGDF for adaptive fusion, and CAM for modulation during fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms existing CD-FSS methods on four datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DCDNet effectively tackles feature entanglement and enhances cross-domain generalization and adaptation.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to tackle the dual challenge of recognizing novel classes and adapting to unseen domains with limited annotations. However, encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting both generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains. To address this issue, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Decoupled Network (DCDNet). In the training stage, to tackle feature entanglement that impedes cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation, we propose the Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) module. It decouples backbone features into category-relevant private and domain-relevant shared representations via contrastive learning and adversarial learning. Then, to mitigate the potential degradation caused by the disentanglement, the Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) module adaptively integrates base, shared, and private features under spatial guidance, maintaining structural coherence. In addition, in the fine-tuning stage, to enhanced model generalization, the Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) module is placed before the MGDF, where shared features guide private features via modulation ensuring effective integration of domain-relevant information. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets show that DCDNet outperforms existing CD-FSS methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation.

*Utkarsh Prakash Srivastava,Kaushik Gupta,Kaushik Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple yet effective pipeline for multilabel chest X-ray classification using SE-ResNeXt101, optimized with techniques like Asymmetric Loss and Label-Graph Refinement, achieving high macro AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multilabel classification of thoracic findings in chest X-rays by addressing challenges like class imbalance and label co-occurrence while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Finetunes SE-ResNeXt101 with a sigmoid head, employs MIS for cross-validation, uses Asymmetric Loss, AMP, cosine learning-rate decay, gradient clipping, EMA, and introduces a Label-Graph Refinement module for logit refinement.

Result: Achieves competitive macro AUC (e.g., 92.64%), with Label-Graph Refinement consistently improving performance across folds with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method is reproducible, hardware-friendly, and enhances multilabel CXR classification without requiring extra annotations.

Abstract: We study multilabel classification of chest X-rays and present a simple, strong pipeline built on SE-ResNeXt101 $(32 \times 4d)$. The backbone is finetuned for 14 thoracic findings with a sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification (MIS) for robust cross-validation splits that preserve label co-occurrence. To address extreme class imbalance and asymmetric error costs, we optimize with Asymmetric Loss, employ mixed-precision (AMP), cosine learning-rate decay with warm-up, gradient clipping, and an exponential moving average (EMA) of weights. We propose a lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module placed after the classifier: given per-label probabilities, it learns a sparse, trainable inter-label coupling matrix that refines logits via a single message-passing step while adding only an L1-regularized parameter head. At inference, we apply horizontal flip test-time augmentation (TTA) and average predictions across MIS folds (a compact deep ensemble). Evaluation uses macro AUC averaging classwise ROC-AUC and skipping single-class labels in a fold to reflect balanced performance across conditions. On our dataset, a strong SE-ResNeXt101 baseline attains competitive macro AUC (e.g., 92.64% in our runs). Adding the Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible compute. The resulting method is reproducible, hardware-friendly, and requires no extra annotations, offering a practical route to stronger multilabel CXR classifiers.

*Shaomeng Wang,He Wang,Xiaolu Wei,Longquan Dai,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PC-Diffusion is a lightweight framework using a Preference Classifier to align human preferences in diffusion models, avoiding costly fine-tuning and reference model reliance while maintaining performance comparable to DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often misalign with human preferences, and existing methods like DPO are computationally expensive and sensitive to reference model quality.

Method: Introduces PC-Diffusion, which employs a trainable Preference Classifier to directly model relative preferences, decoupling preference alignment from generative model fine-tuning.

Result: PC-Diffusion achieves preference consistency similar to DPO but with lower computational costs and improved stability, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: PC-Diffusion effectively addresses DPO's limitations, offering a scalable and stable solution for human preference alignment in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in conditional image generation, yet their outputs often remain misaligned with human preferences. To address this, recent work has applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to diffusion models, yielding significant improvements.~However, DPO-like methods exhibit two key limitations: 1) High computational cost,due to the entire model fine-tuning; 2) Sensitivity to reference model quality}, due to its tendency to introduce instability and bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation.

*Zhongle Ren,Hui Ding,Kai Wang,Biao Hou,Xingyu Luo,Weibin Li,Licheng Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a foundation model for SAR land-cover classification using Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL), addressing limitations of supervised learning with a large-scale dataset (SARSense) and demonstrating superior performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability, generalization, and adaptability issues in SAR land-cover classification caused by reliance on labeled datasets.

Method: Develops DI3CL framework with Dynamic Instance (DI) and Contour Consistency (CC) modules, leveraging a large-scale dataset (SARSense) for pre-training.

Result: DI3CL outperforms existing methods in tasks like SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model enhances SAR land-cover classification, offering robustness and generalization across diverse applications.

Abstract: Although significant advances have been achieved in SAR land-cover classification, recent methods remain predominantly focused on supervised learning, which relies heavily on extensive labeled datasets. This dependency not only limits scalability and generalization but also restricts adaptability to diverse application scenarios. In this paper, a general-purpose foundation model for SAR land-cover classification is developed, serving as a robust cornerstone to accelerate the development and deployment of various downstream models. Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features. To evaluate the generalization capability of our foundation model, we conducted extensive experiments across a variety of SAR land-cover classification tasks, including SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed DI3CL outperforms existing methods. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at: https://github.com/SARpre-train/DI3CL.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the mismatch between discrete MLLM outputs and continuous IQA scores by proposing Q-Scorer, a lightweight framework with a regression module and score tokens, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between MLLMs' discrete outputs and IQA's continuous scores hinders performance, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: Proposes Q-Scorer, integrating a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into MLLMs.

Result: Q-Scorer outperforms benchmarks, generalizes well, and enhances performance when combined with other methods.

Conclusion: Q-Scorer effectively bridges the gap between MLLMs and IQA tasks, delivering state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has boosted the task of image quality assessment (IQA). However, a key challenge arises from the inherent mismatch between the discrete token outputs of MLLMs and the continuous nature of quality scores required by IQA tasks. This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks. To tackle these problems, we provide a theoretical analysis of the errors inherent in previous approaches and, motivated by this analysis, propose a simple yet effective framework, Q-Scorer. This framework incorporates a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into the MLLM pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Scorer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, generalizes well to mixed datasets, and further improves when combined with other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free methods for 3D scene understanding are flexible but often lack accuracy and efficiency. Sparse3DPR addresses these shortcomings.

Method: The framework uses hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graphs and task-adaptive subgraph extraction to improve reasoning and reduce noise.

Result: Sparse3DPR shows a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and 78.2% speedup over ConceptGraphs, with comparable performance to training-based methods on ScanQA.

Conclusion: Sparse3DPR is robust, efficient, and generalizable, offering a promising alternative to training-based approaches.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored widely for 3D scene understanding. Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench. Moreover, Sparse3DPR obtains comparable performance to training-based methods on ScanQA, with additional real-world experiments confirming its robustness and generalization capability.

TL;DR: The paper explores synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) to improve prostate cancer lesion segmentation, showing significant enhancements across various architectures without additional scan time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for prostate cancer lesion segmentation perform poorly (Dice scores ≤0.32), prompting the need for better imaging techniques like CDI$^s$.

Method: The study evaluates CDI$^s$ alongside DWI and ADC sequences using six segmentation architectures on 200 patients.

Result: CDI$^s$ improves performance in 94% of cases, with up to 72.5% relative improvement, and CDI$^s$ + DWI shows consistent benefits without degradation.

Conclusion: CDI$^s$ is a practical, drop-in enhancement for prostate cancer segmentation, easily deployable in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Current deep learning approaches for prostate cancer lesion segmentation achieve limited performance, with Dice scores of 0.32 or lower in large patient cohorts. To address this limitation, we investigate synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) as an enhancement to standard diffusion-based protocols. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities. CDI$^s$ + DWI emerges as the safest enhancement pathway, achieving significant improvements in half of evaluated architectures with zero instances of degradation. Since CDI$^s$ derives from existing DWI acquisitions without requiring additional scan time or architectural modifications, it enables immediate deployment in clinical workflows. Our results establish validated integration pathways for CDI$^s$ as a practical drop-in enhancement for PCa lesion segmentation tasks across diverse deep learning architectures.

TL;DR: SSOMotion is a human motion synthesis framework using Scene Semantic Occupancy (SSO) for unified scene representation, leveraging CLIP encoding and bi-directional tri-plane decomposition for efficiency and fine-grained semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for human motion synthesis lack semantic understanding of scenes, focusing only on structural aspects.

Method: Proposes SSOMotion with bi-directional tri-plane decomposition for compact SSO representation, CLIP encoding for semantic mapping, and frame-wise scene query for motion control.

Result: Achieves cutting-edge performance on ShapeNet, PROX, and Replica datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: SSOMotion successfully integrates semantic understanding into motion synthesis, improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Human motion synthesis in 3D scenes relies heavily on scene comprehension, while current methods focus mainly on scene structure but ignore the semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose a human motion synthesis framework that take an unified Scene Semantic Occupancy (SSO) for scene representation, termed SSOMotion. We design a bi-directional tri-plane decomposition to derive a compact version of the SSO, and scene semantics are mapped to an unified feature space via CLIP encoding and shared linear dimensionality reduction. Such strategy can derive the fine-grained scene semantic structures while significantly reduce redundant computations. We further take these scene hints and movement direction derived from instructions for motion control via frame-wise scene query. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on cluttered scenes using ShapeNet furniture, as well as scanned scenes from PROX and Replica datasets, demonstrate its cutting-edge performance while validating its effectiveness and generalization ability. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/jingyugong/SSOMotion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoCLUE improves monocular 3D object detection by combining local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features, achieving top performance on KITTI benchmark despite occlusion and limited visibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection faces challenges like ill-posed depth and limited field of view, leading to reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. Existing methods overlook visual cues despite incorporating additional depth information.

Method: MonoCLUE uses K-means clustering on visual features to identify object parts (e.g., bonnet) and propagates these features. It also builds a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, ensuring consistent representations. Both features are integrated into object queries to guide attention.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark, demonstrating robust detection under occlusion and limited visibility.

Conclusion: MonoCLUE successfully addresses geometric ambiguity by leveraging visual cues through local clustering and scene memory, providing stable and accurate monocular 3D detection.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a cost-effective solution for autonomous driving but suffers from ill-posed depth and limited field of view. These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal visual perception framework using flow matching to handle multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance across various vision tasks compared to specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of single-task models in diffusion models inspired the development of a universal framework akin to large language models' cross-domain abilities.

Method: The approach uses flow matching to transform image patch tokens into task-specific representations, supported by a self-supervised foundation model and multi-scale task embeddings.

Result: The model outperforms prior generalist and specialist models in tasks like classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval.

Conclusion: This framework advances general-purpose visual perception, offering robustness and scalability for future universal vision modeling research.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in isolated computer vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, depth estimation, and optical flow. However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework. Our work marks a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception, providing a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling.

### [27] [Generating Sketches in a Hierarchical Auto-Regressive Process for Flexible Sketch Drawing Manipulation at Stroke-Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07889)
*Sicong Zang,Shuhui Gao,Zhijun Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generation method for flexible, stroke-level manipulation during the drawing process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods require all stroke conditions to be set before generation, limiting real-time manipulation. The goal is to enable more flexible control during sketch creation.

Method: A three-staged hierarchical process: predicting stroke embeddings, anchoring strokes on canvas, and translating embeddings into drawing actions. This is done auto-regressively, considering recent strokes and positions.

Result: Enables real-time stroke-level manipulation by adjusting editable stroke embeddings during generation, improving flexibility.

Conclusion: The proposed method allows dynamic sketch manipulation during generation, overcoming limitations of pre-set conditions.

Abstract: Generating sketches with specific patterns as expected, i.e., manipulating sketches in a controllable way, is a popular task. Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical analysis of text polarity detection's role in binarization, focusing on histogram statistics and between-class variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the phenomenon observed in histogram statistics during text polarity detection, which is crucial for binarization in computer vision tasks.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis to examine the increasing or decreasing maximum between-class variance in transformed images, depending on text polarity.

Result: Empirical results confirm the observed phenomenon in histogram statistics for dark text on bright backgrounds and vice versa.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis provides deeper insights into text polarity's impact on binarization, enhancing preprocessing techniques for computer vision applications.

Abstract: Several computer vision applications like vehicle license plate recognition, captcha recognition, printed or handwriting character recognition from images etc., text polarity detection and binarization are the important preprocessing tasks. To analyze any image, it has to be converted to a simple binary image. This binarization process requires the knowledge of polarity of text in the images. Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background. The corresponding empirical results have been presented. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon.

Result: Extensive experiments show Earth2Ocean significantly improves performance on the UOVSBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Earth2Ocean effectively bridges the gap in underwater segmentation by leveraging terrestrial VLMs, enhancing biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of marine organisms is vital for biodiversity monitoring and ecological assessment, yet existing datasets and models remain largely limited to terrestrial scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation. Alongside, we present \textbf{Earth2Ocean}, a training-free OV segmentation framework that transfers terrestrial vision--language models (VLMs) to underwater domains without any additional underwater training. Earth2Ocean consists of two core components: a Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (\textbf{GMG}) that refines visual features via self-similarity geometric priors for local structure perception, and a Category-visual Semantic Alignment (\textbf{CSA}) module that enhances text embeddings through multimodal large language model reasoning and scene-aware template construction. Extensive experiments on the UOVSBench benchmark demonstrate that Earth2Ocean achieves significant performance improvement on average while maintaining efficient inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods struggle with dimension and density gaps between 2D inputs and 3D outputs, leading to inferior predictions.

Method: The framework includes a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module to expand 2D features and a High-density Occupancy Refinement module to enhance semantic density.

Result: Experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: HD²-SSC successfully bridges the gaps in SSC, improving 3D scene perception for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, enabling voxelized 3D scene understanding for effective scene perception and decision-making. Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a "detect-and-refine" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D images fail to distinguish terrain depth, impacting path safety. The proposed method addresses this by using disparity maps from UAV-captured images.

Method: Disparity maps from UAV-captured images are processed using edge, line, and corner detection, along with stereo depth reconstruction, to define safe way-points. Initial and desired points are identified via ArUco markers and circle detection.

Result: The algorithm outperforms A* and PRM in simulations (V-REP) and physical lab setups, demonstrating safer and more effective path planning.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully addresses terrain depth limitations of 2D images, offering safer and more efficient path planning compared to A* and PRM.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel image-based path planning algorithm that was developed using computer vision techniques, as well as its comparative analysis with well-known deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, namely A* and Probabilistic Road Map algorithm (PRM). The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment. Results are promising and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedMedCLIP, a federated learning approach using CLIP for medical image classification, addressing data heterogeneity and resource costs with feature adaptation and distillation methods, achieving higher performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models in medical imaging face privacy concerns due to requiring source data; federated learning (FL) offers a solution, but data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder its deployment, especially with vision language models (VLMs).

Method: FedMedCLIP introduces a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) for communication efficiency, freezes CLIP encoders, uses a masked MLP for local tasks, and employs KL divergence-based distillation and model compression for performance.

Result: Experiments show FedMedCLIP outperforms baselines (e.g., 8% higher accuracy on ISIC2019) with significantly lower resource costs (120x faster than FedAVG).

Conclusion: FedMedCLIP effectively addresses FL challenges in medical imaging, balancing performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of deep models in medical imaging, they still require source data for training, which limits their potential in light of privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\times$ faster than FedAVG).

*Sida Huang,Siqi Huang,Ping Luo,Hongyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaySyn dataset and Laytrol Network to improve spatial controllability in layout-to-image generation, preserving pretrained knowledge and enhancing visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layout-to-image methods suffer from low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency due to distribution shifts from pretrained data.

Method: Constructed LaySyn dataset using base model images and proposed Laytrol Network with inherited parameters, specialized initialization, and Object-level Rotary Position Embedding.

Result: Improved visual quality and stylistic consistency in generated images, demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Conclusion: The LaySyn dataset and Laytrol Network effectively address challenges in layout-to-image generation while preserving pretrained knowledge.

Abstract: With the development of diffusion models, enhancing spatial controllability in text-to-image generation has become a vital challenge. As a representative task for addressing this challenge, layout-to-image generation aims to generate images that are spatially consistent with the given layout condition. Existing layout-to-image methods typically introduce the layout condition by integrating adapter modules into the base generative model. However, the generated images often exhibit low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with the base model, indicating a loss of pretrained knowledge. To alleviate this issue, we construct the Layout Synthesis (LaySyn) dataset, which leverages images synthesized by the base model itself to mitigate the distribution shift from the pretraining data. Moreover, we propose the Layout Control (Laytrol) Network, in which parameters are inherited from MM-DiT to preserve the pretrained knowledge of the base model. To effectively activate the copied parameters and avoid disturbance from unstable control conditions, we adopt a dedicated initialization scheme for Laytrol. In this scheme, the layout encoder is initialized as a pure text encoder to ensure that its output tokens remain within the data domain of MM-DiT. Meanwhile, the outputs of the layout control network are initialized to zero. In addition, we apply Object-level Rotary Position Embedding to the layout tokens to provide coarse positional information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Seyedehnanita Madani,Rama Chellappa,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRegCD is a unified framework combining dense registration and change detection, leveraging diffusion features and classification-based correspondence for robust performance under large displacements and variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like parallax, viewpoint shifts, and temporal gaps in real-world imagery that cause misalignment in traditional and recent CD methods.

Method: Uses Gaussian smoothed classification for sub-pixel accurate correspondence, frozen multi-scale diffusion features for robustness, and supervised affine perturbations.

Result: Outperforms baselines on multiple datasets (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD, VL-CMU-CD) under wide temporal and geometric variations.

Conclusion: DiffRegCD establishes diffusion features and classification-based correspondence as effective foundations for unified change detection.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is fundamental to computer vision and remote sensing, supporting applications in environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban development. Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.

*Rui-Qing Sun,Ang Li,Zhijing Wu,Tian Lan,Qianyu Lu,Xingshan Yao,Chen Xu,Xian-Ling Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISExplore, a segment selection strategy for talking face generation (TFG) that identifies informative 5-second video segments, reducing processing time significantly while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TFG methods require lengthy reference videos for fitting, which is computationally intensive. The study questions this necessity and explores the potential of shorter, high-quality segments.

Method: Proposes ISExplore, a strategy that selects informative 5-second segments based on audio diversity, lip movement amplitude, and camera views.

Result: ISExplore speeds up data processing and training by over 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods without sacrificing output fidelity.

Conclusion: Shorter, high-quality segments can replace lengthy videos in TFG, making the process more efficient while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Talking Face Generation (TFG) aims to produce realistic and dynamic talking portraits, with broad applications in fields such as digital education, film and television production, e-commerce live streaming, and other related areas. Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning (MPMIL) to address challenges in computational pathology, leveraging LLMs and bidirectional interaction for improved generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational cost of WSIs and bias in LLM-generated instance-level descriptions, the paper emphasizes the need for task-specific pathological entity prototypes and better cross-modal synergy.

Method: Proposes MPMIL, using frozen LLMs for text prototypes, vision prototypes for redundancy reduction, and Stereoscopic Optimal Transport for fusion.

Result: Achieves superior generalization in few-shot classification and explainability experiments across three cancer datasets.

Conclusion: MPMIL effectively enhances model interpretability and generalization through bidirectional interaction and task-specific prototypes.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a promising direction in computational pathology, the substantial computational cost of giga-pixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates the use of Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to enable effective modeling. A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReIDMamba, a Mamba-based framework for person re-identification, addressing scalability issues of Transformers by leveraging fine-grained global features and introducing novel techniques for robust feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scalability and computational limitations of Transformer-based methods in person ReID while maintaining or improving discriminative feature extraction.

Method: Proposes ReIDMamba, featuring a Mamba-based baseline with multiple class tokens, a multi-granularity feature extractor module (MGFE), and ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) for feature diversity and robustness.

Result: ReIDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, with one-third the parameters of TransReID, lower GPU memory usage, and faster inference.

Conclusion: The purely Mamba-driven ReID framework successfully addresses scalability issues while enhancing feature robustness and performance.

Abstract: Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Burst Image Quality Assessment (BuIQA) to evaluate frame quality in burst sequences, addressing redundancy issues. It proposes a benchmark dataset and a unified framework, showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burst imaging faces challenges like redundancy, increased storage/transmission demands, and reduced efficiency in downstream tasks, prompting the need for BuIQA.

Method: The authors establish a benchmark dataset, propose a unified BuIQA framework with task-driven prompt generation and quality assessment networks, and use heterogeneous knowledge distillation.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 10 downstream scenarios and improves PSNR by 0.33 dB in denoising and super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: BuIQA effectively addresses burst image redundancy and enhances downstream task efficiency, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of burst imaging technology has improved the capture and processing capabilities of visual data, enabling a wide range of applications. However, the redundancy in burst images leads to the increased storage and transmission demands, as well as reduced efficiency of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a new task of Burst Image Quality Assessment (BuIQA), to evaluate the task-driven quality of each frame within a burst sequence, providing reasonable cues for burst image selection. Specifically, we establish the first benchmark dataset for BuIQA, consisting of $7,346$ burst sequences with $45,827$ images and $191,572$ annotated quality scores for multiple downstream scenarios. Inspired by the data analysis, a unified BuIQA framework is proposed to achieve an efficient adaption for BuIQA under diverse downstream scenarios. Specifically, a task-driven prompt generation network is developed with heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to learn the priors of the downstream task. Then, the task-aware quality assessment network is introduced to assess the burst image quality based on the task prompt. Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios demonstrate the impressive BuIQA performance of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it can achieve $0.33$ dB PSNR improvement in the downstream tasks of denoising and super-resolution, by applying our approach to select the high-quality burst frames.

*Shenao Zhao,Pengpeng Liang,Zhoufan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMAssist improves 3D unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) by using multi-modal (image, text) data to align features between domains, enhancing pseudo labels with 2D detectors, and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image data is often collected with LiDAR point clouds but underutilized in 3D UDA. MMAssist leverages multi-modal data to bridge domain gaps and improve detection performance.

Method: Aligns 3D features between domains using image/text features as bridges. Projects labels to images for 2D boxes, extracts image/text features, and fuses them with 3D features. Enhances pseudo labels with 2D detector outputs.

Result: Achieves promising performance in three domain adaptation tasks across popular datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MMAssist demonstrates the value of multi-modal data in 3D UDA, offering a robust framework for feature alignment and pseudo-label enhancement.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for LiDAR-based 3D object detection (3D UDA) based on the teacher-student architecture with pseudo labels has achieved notable improvements in recent years. Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

*Seyedehanita Madani,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular pipeline to improve spatial and temporal robustness in remote sensing change detection by integrating diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and flow refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like spatial misalignment in bi-temporal images and improve robustness without altering existing change detection networks.

Method: Proposes a framework with diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement.

Result: Consistent gains in registration accuracy and change detection across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enhances generality and effectiveness for remote sensing change detection.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is often challenged by spatial misalignment between bi-temporal images, especially when acquisitions are separated by long seasonal or multi-year gaps. While modern convolutional and transformer-based models perform well on aligned data, their reliance on precise co-registration limits their robustness in real-world conditions. Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DANCE, a framework for point cloud completion that handles variable sparsity and limited supervision, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion methods assume fixed densities or rely on image-based representations, making them unsuitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision.

Method: DANCE uses ray-based sampling to generate candidate points and refines them with a transformer decoder. It includes a lightweight classification head for semantic guidance.

Result: DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PCN and MVP benchmarks in accuracy and structural consistency, while being robust to varying densities and noise.

Conclusion: DANCE provides a robust and accurate solution for point cloud completion, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover missing geometric structures from incomplete 3D scans, which often suffer from occlusions or limited sensor viewpoints. Existing methods typically assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them less suitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision. In this paper, we introduce Density-agnostic and Class-aware Network (DANCE), a novel framework that completes only the missing regions while preserving the observed geometry. DANCE generates candidate points via ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints. A transformer decoder then refines their positions and predicts opacity scores, which determine the validity of each point for inclusion in the final surface. To incorporate semantic guidance, a lightweight classification head is trained directly on geometric features, enabling category-consistent completion without external image supervision. Extensive experiments on the PCN and MVP benchmarks show that DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels.

Result: CSF-Net improves inpainting quality, reduces object hallucination, and enhances realism and semantic alignment on Places365 and COCOA datasets.

Conclusion: CSF-Net is effective, adaptable, and enhances performance across diverse masking conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semantic-guided framework to address the challenging problem of large-mask image inpainting, where essential visual content is missing and contextual cues are limited. To compensate for the limited context, we leverage a pretrained Amodal Completion (AC) model to generate structure-aware candidates that serve as semantic priors for the missing regions. We introduce Context-Semantic Fusion Network (CSF-Net), a transformer-based fusion framework that fuses these candidates with contextual features to produce a semantic guidance image for image inpainting. This guidance improves inpainting quality by promoting structural accuracy and semantic consistency. CSF-Net can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting models without architectural changes and consistently enhances performance across diverse masking conditions. Extensive experiments on the Places365 and COCOA datasets demonstrate that CSF-Net effectively reduces object hallucination while enhancing visual realism and semantic alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling issues in VideoLLMs caused by redundant visual tokens.

Method: SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information and prunes degraded visual features via self-calibration.

Result: SharpV outperforms dense models and achieves hierarchical cache pruning, demonstrating superiority on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SharpV introduces a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning in VideoLLMs, ensuring efficiency and compatibility with hardware acceleration.

Abstract: Current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) suffer from quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling, due to their reliance on processing excessive redundant visual tokens. To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.

Conclusion: EAGLE's memory consolidation mechanism effectively handles appearance variations and unifies 2D-3D tasks, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Egocentric visual query localization is vital for embodied AI and VR/AR, yet remains challenging due to camera motion, viewpoint changes, and appearance variations. We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space. Our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the Ego4D-VQ benchmark.

TL;DR: AdvRoad generates road-style adversarial posters to stealthily deceive 3D object detectors in autonomous driving systems while maintaining natural appearances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual 3D detection models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising safety concerns in autonomous driving. Existing attacks using unnatural posters are noticeable and easily defensible.

Method: AdvRoad employs a two-stage approach: Road-Style Adversary Generation ensures natural appearances, and Scenario-Associated Adaptation maximizes attack effectiveness.

Result: AdvRoad successfully fools detectors across various scenes and locations, and physical experiments confirm real-world threats.

Conclusion: The study highlights practical risks of adversarial attacks in autonomous driving and proposes a stealthy solution.

Abstract: Modern autonomous driving (AD) systems leverage 3D object detection to perceive foreground objects in 3D environments for subsequent prediction and planning. Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments.

*Zhiyuan Chen,Yuelin Guo,Zitong Huang,Haoyu He,Renhao Lu,Weizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cascade HQP-DETR to improve synthetic-to-real object detection by addressing limitations in synthetic data quality, DETR convergence issues, and denoising pressure uniformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of annotating real-world datasets motivates synthetic training (ISOD), but current methods suffer from poor data quality, slow convergence, and noise overfitting.

Method: Proposes Cascade HQP-DETR with (1) a high-quality synthetic data pipeline (FluxVOC/FluxCOCO), (2) High-Quality Proposal query initialization, and (3) cascade denoising with dynamic IoU thresholds.

Result: Achieves 61.04% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007 in just 12 epochs, outperforming baselines and confirming real-world applicability.

Conclusion: Cascade HQP-DETR successfully addresses synthetic-to-real detection challenges, offering a robust and efficient solution.

Abstract: Object detection models demand large-scale annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to create. This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels. Trained for just 12 epochs solely on FluxVOC, Cascade HQP-DETR achieves a SOTA 61.04\% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007, outperforming strong baselines, with its competitive real-data performance confirming the architecture's universal applicability.

*Chende Zheng,Ruiqi Suo,Zhoulin Ji,Jingyi Deng,Fangbin Yi,Chenhao Lin,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal framework using Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer) for detecting and localizing deepfake content by leveraging cross-modal correlations and achieving frame-level precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unimodal detection methods lack cross-modal correlation and precise localization, making them ineffective against sophisticated deepfake manipulations.

Method: Utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) with a multi-scale feature pyramid and dual-branch prediction head for forgery detection and temporal boundary refinement.

Result: Achieved a score of 0.7535 on the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, demonstrating effective cross-modal deepfake detection and localization.

Conclusion: The framework provides a generalized solution for detecting and localizing deepfake content, addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has enabled the creation of highly realistic deepfake content, posing significant threats to digital trust across audio-visual domains. While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/MM-DDL

*Zhaolin Wan,Yining Diao,Jingqi Xu,Hao Wang,Zhiyang Li,Xiaopeng Fan,Wangmeng Zuo,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3DGS-QA, the first dataset for assessing perceptual quality in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering, and proposes a no-reference quality prediction model that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research focused on algorithmic performance and visual fidelity in 3DGS, leaving perceptual quality under varying reconstruction conditions unexplored.

Method: The authors created a dataset with 225 degraded reconstructions and developed a no-reference model that extracts spatial and photometric cues from Gaussian primitives.

Result: The proposed model consistently outperforms traditional and learning-based quality assessment methods.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in 3DGS quality assessment and provides publicly available resources for future research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D visualization, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technique for real-time, high-fidelity rendering. While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner. We further benchmark existing quality assessment methods, spanning both traditional and learning-based approaches. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves superior performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation. The dataset and code are made publicly available at https://github.com/diaoyn/3DGSQA to facilitate future research in 3DGS quality assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEDepth adapts Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for monocular depth estimation (MDE) without structural changes or weight modifications, leveraging their inherent priors for state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation is challenging due to its ill-posed nature. Leveraging pre-trained VFMs' world understanding capabilities can improve MDE without extensive modifications.

Method: WEDepth uses VFMs as multi-level feature enhancers, injecting prior knowledge at different representation levels while preserving their original structures and weights.

Result: WEDepth achieves new SOTA performance on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets, outperforming diffusion-based methods and those pre-trained on relative depth. It also shows strong zero-shot transfer capability.

Conclusion: WEDepth effectively harnesses VFMs' inherent priors for MDE, offering competitive performance and adaptability across diverse scenarios without altering pre-trained models.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has widely applicable but remains highly challenging due to the inherently ill-posed nature of reconstructing 3D scenes from single 2D images. Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors. Our method employs the VFM as a multi-level feature en-hancer, systematically injecting prior knowledge at differ-ent representation levels. Experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets show that WEDepth establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, achieving competi-tive results compared to both diffusion-based approaches (which require multiple forward passes) and methods pre-trained on relative depth. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method exhibits strong zero-shot transfer capability across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing high inter-observer variability in medical image segmentation, particularly in lung nodule delineation, where expert annotations often disagree.

Method: ProSona uses a probabilistic U-Net backbone to capture diverse expert hypotheses and a prompt-guided projection mechanism to navigate a latent space for personalized segmentations, enhanced by a multi-level contrastive objective.

Result: ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by over one point compared to DPersona on LIDC-IDRI and prostate MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Natural-language prompts offer flexible, accurate, and interpretable control over personalized medical image segmentation, demonstrated by ProSona's superior performance.

Abstract: Automated medical image segmentation suffers from high inter-observer variability, particularly in tasks such as lung nodule delineation, where experts often disagree. Existing approaches either collapse this variability into a consensus mask or rely on separate model branches for each annotator. We introduce ProSona, a two-stage framework that learns a continuous latent space of annotation styles, enabling controllable personalization via natural language prompts. A probabilistic U-Net backbone captures diverse expert hypotheses, while a prompt-guided projection mechanism navigates this latent space to generate personalized segmentations. A multi-level contrastive objective aligns textual and visual representations, promoting disentangled and interpretable expert styles. Across the LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets, ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona. These results demonstrate that natural-language prompts can provide flexible, accurate, and interpretable control over personalized medical image segmentation.

*Jer Pelhan,Alan Lukezic,Matej Kristan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GECO2 is a few-shot counting and detection method that improves accuracy and speed for diverse-sized and densely populated objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions due to ad-hoc solutions like upsampling and tiling.

Method: GECO2 uses dense query representation to aggregate exemplar-specific features across scales, enabling detection of both large and small objects.

Result: GECO2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% in accuracy and runs 3x faster with lower GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: GECO2 effectively addresses scale issues in few-shot counting and detection, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Few-shot detection-based counters estimate the number of instances in the image specified only by a few test-time exemplars. A common approach to localize objects across multiple sizes is to merge backbone features of different resolutions. Furthermore, to enable small object detection in densely populated regions, the input image is commonly upsampled and tiling is applied to cope with the increased computational and memory requirements. Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects. We propose GECO2, an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that explicitly addresses the object scale issues. A new dense query representation gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales that leads to high-resolution dense queries that enable detection of large as well as small objects. GECO2 surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters in counting as well as detection accuracy by 10% while running 3x times faster at smaller GPU memory footprint.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model with latent concatenation and masked CFM for subject-driven image generation, balancing identity consistency and prompt diversity. It introduces a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework for scalable training and CHARIS for fine-grained evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between identity consistency and prompt diversity in subject-driven image generation, ensuring robust identity preservation without architectural changes.

Method: Uses LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model with latent concatenation, masked CFM objective, and a two-stage data curation framework (data restoration, VLM filtering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning).

Result: Enables scalable generation across diverse subjects and contexts while maintaining identity consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances identity preservation and diversity, supported by CHARIS for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel depictions of a specific subject across diverse contexts while preserving its core identity features. Achieving both strong identity consistency and high prompt diversity presents a fundamental trade-off. We propose a LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model employing a latent concatenation strategy, which jointly processes reference and target images, combined with a masked Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective. This approach enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications. To facilitate large-scale training, we introduce a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework: the first stage leverages data restoration and VLM-based filtering to create a compact, high-quality seed dataset from diverse sources; the second stage utilizes these curated examples for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thus scaling the generation capability across various subjects and contexts. Finally, for filtering and quality assessment, we present CHARIS, a fine-grained evaluation framework that performs attribute-level comparisons along five key axes: identity consistency, prompt adherence, region-wise color fidelity, visual quality, and transformation diversity.

Result: I2E achieves 300x faster conversion than prior methods, enabling SNNs to reach 60.50% accuracy on ImageNet and 92.5% on CIFAR10-DVS.

Conclusion: I2E bridges the gap in neuromorphic engineering by providing scalable synthetic event data, advancing high-performance SNN development.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise highly energy-efficient computing, but their adoption is hindered by a critical scarcity of event-stream data. This work introduces I2E, an algorithmic framework that resolves this bottleneck by converting static images into high-fidelity event streams. By simulating microsaccadic eye movements with a highly parallelized convolution, I2E achieves a conversion speed over 300x faster than prior methods, uniquely enabling on-the-fly data augmentation for SNN training. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on large-scale benchmarks. An SNN trained on the generated I2E-ImageNet dataset achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.50%. Critically, this work establishes a powerful sim-to-real paradigm where pre-training on synthetic I2E data and fine-tuning on the real-world CIFAR10-DVS dataset yields an unprecedented accuracy of 92.5%. This result validates that synthetic event data can serve as a high-fidelity proxy for real sensor data, bridging a long-standing gap in neuromorphic engineering. By providing a scalable solution to the data problem, I2E offers a foundational toolkit for developing high-performance neuromorphic systems. The open-source algorithm and all generated datasets are provided to accelerate research in the field.

*Ying Wang,Zhaodong Sun,Xu Cheng,Zuxian He,Xiaobai Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Radar-APLANC, an unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing using augmented pseudo-labels and noise contrast, achieving performance comparable to supervised methods without costly labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods degrade due to noise, and learning-based methods require expensive labeled signals. The goal is to develop an unsupervised solution that avoids these limitations.

Method: The proposed Radar-APLANC framework uses heartbeat and noise ranges to create positive and negative samples, employing Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss with pseudo-labels from traditional radar methods. Adaptive noise-aware label selection enhances pseudo-label quality.

Result: Experiments on the Equipleth dataset and a collected radar dataset show Radar-APLANC matches state-of-the-art supervised methods in performance.

Conclusion: Radar-APLANC successfully enables unsupervised radar-based heartbeat sensing with noise robustness, eliminating the need for costly labeled data while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can measure subtle chest wall oscillations to enable non-contact heartbeat sensing. However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality. Extensive experiments on the Equipleth dataset and our collected radar dataset demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

*Cameron Braunstein,Mariya Toneva,Eddy Ilg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion excel in text-to-image generation, but their semantic understanding is unclear. Probing reveals semantic information originates from CLIP's text encoding, not diffusion, with varying decoding accuracy for attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether latent diffusion models semantically comprehend generated images by analyzing internal representations.

Method: Probing Stable Diffusion with regression layers to predict semantic attributes, comparing predictions against human annotations.

Result: Semantic information stems from CLIP's text encoding, not diffusion, with attribute decoding accuracy varying widely.

Conclusion: CLIP, not diffusion, provides human-like semantic representation; diffusion acts as a visual decoder.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion achieve state-of-the-art results on text-to-image generation tasks. However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Beyond the Pixels,' a hierarchical framework for evaluating identity preservation in generative models, focusing on fine-grained feature-level transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics inadequately capture fine-grained identity changes and lack diagnostic insight.

Method: The framework decomposes identity into a hierarchical (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree and uses structured VLM prompting for concrete transformations.

Result: Validated across four models, the framework aligns well with human judgments and introduces a new benchmark (1,078 image-prompt pairs) stressing generative models.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical approach improves identity evaluation by reducing hallucinations and enhancing consistency.

Abstract: Evaluating identity preservation in generative models remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt.

TL;DR: StableMorph introduces a diffusion-based method to create highly realistic morphed face images, addressing the limitations of existing techniques and posing a greater challenge to detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing morph generation methods often produce low-quality images with artifacts, making them easy to detect and not representative of real-world threats. StableMorph aims to improve the realism and effectiveness of morphed images for better evaluation of biometric security systems.

Method: StableMorph utilizes modern diffusion-based image synthesis to generate artifact-free, full-head morphed face images with sharp details and controlled visual attributes.

Result: StableMorph produces morphed images that rival or exceed genuine face quality, effectively fooling face recognition systems and challenging existing MAD solutions.

Conclusion: StableMorph sets a new standard for morph quality, enhancing the evaluation of biometric security and supporting the development of more robust detection systems.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten the integrity of biometric identity systems by enabling multiple individuals to share a single identity. To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems.

Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks like NFMs, which mimic facial geometry closely, posing risks to reliability.

Method: Created a dataset with 3,760 bona fide and 51,281 NFM attack samples using an iPhone 11 Pro, tested with five PAD methods.

Result: Performance of PAD methods varied significantly, indicating challenges in detecting NFM attacks.

Conclusion: Developing PAD techniques that generalize to unseen spoofing threats like NFMs is crucial for face recognition system security.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are increasingly deployed across a wide range of applications, including smartphone authentication, access control, and border security. However, these systems remain vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), which can significantly compromise their reliability. In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions. The results demonstrate significant performance variability across methods, highlighting the challenges posed by NFMs and underscoring the importance of developing PAD techniques that generalise effectively to emerging spoofing threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foam formation in WTPs reduces efficiency and increases costs, but standard ML models require large labeled datasets. Data sharing is hindered by privacy concerns and heterogeneity.

Method: The framework integrates FL with SAM2, leveraging SAM2's pre-trained weights and training distributedly via Flower. It uses real-world, synthetic, and public datasets for validation.

Result: The approach accelerates convergence and enhances segmentation performance, even with limited local data, ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates FL's potential with foundational models for industrial challenges like foam tracking, offering a scalable, privacy-aware solution.

Abstract: Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs.

*Lixu Sun,Nurmemet Yolwas,Wushour Silamu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSNet is a three-stage network inspired by human cognitive processes, designed to improve Scene Text Recognition (STR) by addressing visual-linguistic misalignment and attention bias. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STR frameworks suffer from visual-linguistic misalignment and attention bias toward background distractors, degrading recognition accuracy for irregular text patterns.

Method: OTSNet uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) DAME for refined visual features, (2) PAM and SQ for spatial-semantic integration, and (3) MMCV for cross-modal feature fusion and self-correction.

Result: OTSNet achieves 83.5% accuracy on Union14M-L and 79.1% on OST, setting new records in 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: OTSNet effectively addresses STR challenges through neurocognitive-inspired design, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains challenging due to real-world complexities, where decoupled visual-linguistic optimization in existing frameworks amplifies error propagation through cross-modal misalignment. Visual encoders exhibit attention bias toward background distractors, while decoders suffer from spatial misalignment when parsing geometrically deformed text-collectively degrading recognition accuracy for irregular patterns. Inspired by the hierarchical cognitive processes in human visual perception, we propose OTSNet, a novel three-stage network embodying a neurocognitive-inspired Observation-Thinking-Spelling pipeline for unified STR modeling. The architecture comprises three core components: (1) a Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) that refines visual features through differential attention maps to suppress irrelevant regions and enhance discriminative focus; (2) a Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) that jointly integrate spatial context with glyph-level semantic abstraction via adaptive sampling; and (3) a Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) that enforces self-correction through cross-modal fusion of visual, semantic, and character-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OTSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 83.5% average accuracy on the challenging Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on the heavily occluded OST dataset-establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

*Luoping Cui,Hanqing Liu,Mingjie Liu,Endian Lin,Donghong Jiang,Yuhao Wang,Chuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEOD introduces a high-resolution Event-RGB dataset for robust object detection under challenging conditions, benchmarking 14 methods and highlighting fusion models' strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Event-RGB datasets lack coverage of extreme conditions and high resolution, limiting robust detector evaluation.

Method: PEOD offers a large-scale, pixel-aligned, high-resolution dataset with 130+ sequences and 340k bounding boxes, focusing on low-light, overexposure, and high-speed motion.

Result: Fusion models excel overall, but event-based models outperform in illumination challenges, revealing fusion method limitations when RGB degrades.

Conclusion: PEOD provides a realistic benchmark for multimodal perception, aiding future research in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Robust object detection for challenging scenarios increasingly relies on event cameras, yet existing Event-RGB datasets remain constrained by sparse coverage of extreme conditions and low spatial resolution (<= 640 x 480), which prevents comprehensive evaluation of detectors under challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose PEOD, the first large-scale, pixel-aligned and high-resolution (1280 x 720) Event-RGB dataset for object detection under challenge conditions. PEOD contains 130+ spatiotemporal-aligned sequences and 340k manual bounding boxes, with 57% of data captured under low-light, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Furthermore, we benchmark 14 methods across three input configurations (Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion) on PEOD. On the full test set and normal subset, fusion-based models achieve the excellent performance. However, in illumination challenge subset, the top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform their RGB-based counterparts, indicating limits of existing fusion methods when the frame modality is severely degraded. PEOD establishes a realistic, high-quality benchmark for multimodal perception and facilitates future research.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Boomda, a method for multimodal domain adaptation using balanced multi-objective optimization to address varying domain shifts across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of expensive manual annotation in multimodal learning by addressing the scarcity of annotated data through unsupervised domain adaptation.

Method: Introduces the information bottleneck for modality-specific representations, aligns source and target domains via correlation alignment, and formulates a Pareto optimal solution as a quadratic programming problem.

Result: Boomda outperforms competing schemes, demonstrating effectiveness in multimodal domain adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed Boomda method efficiently balances domain alignment across modalities, offering a scalable solution for multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal learning, while contributing to numerous success stories across various fields, faces the challenge of prohibitively expensive manual annotation. To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm. The proposed method features \textbf{B}alanced multi-\textbf{o}bjective \textbf{o}ptimization for \textbf{m}ultimodal \textbf{d}omain \textbf{a}daptation, termed \textbf{Boomda}. Extensive empirical results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that Boomda outperforms the competing schemes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) image quality assessment, addressing challenges in misalignment and generalization. It uses synthetic distortions and contrastive learning for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of Full-Reference (FR-IQA) and No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods in evaluating NVS images without pixel-aligned references.

Method: Developed a NAR-IQA framework using synthetic distortions, trained via contrastive learning with LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings, and guided by existing IQA methods.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods and correlates strongly with human subjective ratings.

Conclusion: The proposed NAR-IQA framework effectively assesses NVS image quality, demonstrating robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Evaluating the perceptual quality of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) images remains a key challenge, particularly in the absence of pixel-aligned ground truth references. Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS. We find strong correlation between our proposed quality prediction model and the collected subjective ratings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LandSegmenter is a universal LULC FM framework addressing input, model, and output challenges with weak labels, cross-modal adapters, and confidence-guided fusion, achieving strong zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LULC models lack generality due to modality and taxonomy specificity, and FM fine-tuning or large labeled datasets are impractical for RS applications.

Method: Proposes LandSegmenter with LAS dataset (weak labels), RS-specific adapter, text encoder, and confidence-guided fusion for zero-shot enhancement.

Result: Competitive/superior performance in transfer learning and zero-shot settings across six diverse LULC datasets.

Conclusion: LandSegmenter shows promise for universal LULC mapping using weak supervision and task-specific FM adaptations.

Abstract: Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping is a fundamental task in Earth Observation (EO). However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets. These results highlight the efficacy of our proposed framework and the utility of weak supervision for building task-specific FMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mg-MRN, a network refining visual features for zero-shot learning by leveraging multi-granularity feature interactions, improving recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSL methods overlook interactions between local region features, limiting the acquisition of transferable visual features.

Method: Mg-MRN uses decoupled multi-granularity feature extraction and cross-granularity fusion to enhance visual-semantic interactions.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show Mg-MRN's superiority in ZSL tasks.

Conclusion: Mg-MRN effectively improves ZSL performance by refining visual features through multi-granularity interactions.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes with zero samples by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes. Current approaches typically correlate global visual features with semantic information (i.e., attributes) or align local visual region features with corresponding attributes to enhance visual-semantic interactions. Although effective, these methods often overlook the intrinsic interactions between local region features, which can further improve the acquisition of transferable and explicit visual features. In this paper, we propose a network named Multi-Granularity Mutual Refinement Network (Mg-MRN), which refine discriminative and transferable visual features by learning decoupled multi-granularity features and cross-granularity feature interactions. Specifically, we design a multi-granularity feature extraction module to learn region-level discriminative features through decoupled region feature mining. Then, a cross-granularity feature fusion module strengthens the inherent interactions between region features of varying granularities. This module enhances the discriminability of representations at each granularity level by integrating region representations from adjacent hierarchies, further improving ZSL recognition performance. Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of our proposed Mg-MRN method. Our code is available at https://github.com/NingWang2049/Mg-MRN.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel shadow generation framework combining Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA) to improve realism and geometric accuracy in image composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods, including diffusion-based techniques like IC-Light, struggle with producing realistic and geometrically accurate shadows, especially in composite images.

Method: Proposes KPLM for physically plausible shadow projection and STA for geometric precision through explicit formulations.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in shadow realism benchmarks and adapts well to complex poses and multi-directional relighting.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly advances shadow generation in image composition by addressing realism and geometric accuracy challenges.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly integrate a foreground object into a background, where generating realistic and geometrically accurate shadows remains a persistent challenge. While recent diffusion-based methods have outperformed GAN-based approaches, existing techniques, such as the diffusion-based relighting framework IC-Light, still fall short in producing shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision, especially in composite images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel shadow generation framework based on a Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and a Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA). KPLM models articulated human bodies using nine keypoints and one bounding block, enabling physically plausible shadow projection and dynamic shading across joints, thereby enhancing visual realism. STA further improves geometric accuracy by computing shadow angles, lengths, and spatial positions through explicit geometric formulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on shadow realism benchmarks, particularly under complex human poses, and generalizes effectively to multi-directional relighting scenarios such as those supported by IC-Light.

TL;DR: DistZSL is a framework for distributed zero-shot learning that addresses data heterogeneity across nodes using attribute regularization and global consensus, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to exploit decentralized data effectively for zero-shot learning while addressing data heterogeneity challenges.

Method: It introduces a cross-node attribute regularizer for stable attribute features and a global attribute-to-visual consensus to reduce biased mappings.

Result: Experiments show DistZSL outperforms existing methods in distributed zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: DistZSL successfully enhances zero-shot learning across distributed nodes by ensuring stable attribute features and consistent mappings.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Distributed Zero-Shot Learning (DistZSL) framework that can fully exploit decentralized data to learn an effective model for unseen classes. Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes. Thus, the learned consistent V2A mapping can significantly enhance zero-shot learning across different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DistZSL achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art in learning from distributed data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting visual anomalies in diverse, multi-class real-world images without manual annotations or per-class training.

Method: Combines Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with Vision-Language Model (VLM) using detailed image descriptions extracted via simple prompts for robust anomaly detection.

Result: Improves pixel-level PRO metric by up to 25 points on Real-IAD and 8 points on COCO-AD datasets, outperforming existing diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: \ours demonstrates superior performance in multi-class anomaly detection by leveraging VLMs, offering scalability and generalization without manual intervention.

Abstract: Detecting visual anomalies in diverse, multi-class real-world images is a significant challenge. We introduce \ours, a novel unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection framework. It integrates a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for enhanced anomaly localization and detection. Specifically, a pre-trained VLM with a simple prompt extracts detailed image descriptions, serving as additional conditioning for LDM training. Current diffusion-based methods rely on synthetic noise generation, limiting their generalization and requiring per-class model training, which hinders scalability. \ours, however, leverages VLMs to obtain normal captions without manual annotations or additional training. These descriptions condition the diffusion model, learning a robust normal image feature representation for multi-class anomaly detection. Our method achieves competitive performance, improving the pixel-level Per-Region-Overlap (PRO) metric by up to 25 points on the Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on the COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

*Kaitao Huang,Yan Yan,Jing-Hao Xue,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WarpGAN improves 3D GAN inversion by combining image inpainting for occluded regions, leveraging symmetry and multi-view consistency to enhance quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to generate high-quality occluded regions due to reliance on low bit-rate latent codes.

Method: Uses a warping-and-inpainting strategy with SVINet to inpaint occluded regions, ensuring symmetry and multi-view consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: WarpGAN effectively addresses occluded region quality issues in 3D GAN inversion.

Abstract: 3D GAN inversion projects a single image into the latent space of a pre-trained 3D GAN to achieve single-shot novel view synthesis, which requires visible regions with high fidelity and occluded regions with realism and multi-view consistency. However, existing methods focus on the reconstruction of visible regions, while the generation of occluded regions relies only on the generative prior of 3D GAN. As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN. Then, we perform warping to a novel view using the depth map generated by 3D GAN. Finally, we develop a novel SVINet, which leverages the symmetry prior and multi-view image correspondence w.r.t. the same latent code to perform inpainting of occluded regions in the warped image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

### [73] [Pixel-level Quality Assessment for Oriented Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08186)
*Yunhui Zhu,Buliao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA), a framework replacing box-level IoU prediction with pixel-level spatial consistency to improve object detection accuracy by reducing overestimation bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing box-level IoU prediction methods suffer from structural coupling, leading to overestimated quality scores for poorly localized boxes.

Method: PQA measures pixel-level spatial consistency between predicted and ground-truth boxes, avoiding direct box comparison. A new integration metric aggregates pixel-level data into a unified quality score.

Result: Experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA show PQA improves performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet).

Conclusion: PQA effectively addresses the limitations of box-level IoU prediction, enhancing detection accuracy in oriented object detectors.

Abstract: Modern oriented object detectors typically predict a set of bounding boxes and select the top-ranked ones based on estimated localization quality. Achieving high detection performance requires that the estimated quality closely aligns with the actual localization accuracy. To this end, existing approaches predict the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth (GT) boxes as a proxy for localization quality. However, box-level IoU prediction suffers from a structural coupling issue: since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal estimation of the GT box, the predicted IoU--based on their similarity--can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework, which replaces box-level IoU prediction with the integration of pixel-level spatial consistency. PQA measures the alignment between each pixel's relative position to the predicted box and its corresponding position to the GT box. By operating at the pixel level, PQA avoids directly comparing the predicted box with the estimated GT box, thereby eliminating the inherent similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new integration metric that aggregates pixel-level spatial consistency into a unified quality score, yielding a more accurate approximation of the actual localization quality. Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA demonstrate that PQA can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI coding approaches lack multimodal capabilities and iterative feedback, limiting performance.

Method: Interactive UI-to-code paradigm using staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and RL; unifies UI-to-code, editing, and polishing.

Result: Sets new benchmarks among open-source models, matches closed-source leaders like Claude-4-Sonnet.

Conclusion: UI2Code$^text{N}$ advances UI coding with interactive workflows and foundational improvements.

Abstract: User interface (UI) programming is a core yet highly complex part of modern software development. Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding. The model unifies three key capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback. Experiments on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks show that UI2Code$^\text{N}$ establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

Motivation: To tackle challenges in computer-aided medical diagnoses, such as limited data availability and high annotation costs, especially for rare diseases, by improving open-set recognition.

Method: Introduces a loss function penalizing open space regions using auxiliary datasets, leveraging deep neural network features clustered around class means.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains on four MedMNIST datasets and a public skin dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses open-set recognition in medical diagnostics, demonstrating robustness and outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in deep learning, computer-aided diagnoses have made remarkable progress. However, outside controlled laboratory settings, algorithms may encounter several challenges. In the medical domain, these difficulties often stem from limited data availability due to ethical and legal restrictions, as well as the high cost and time required for expert annotations-especially in the face of emerging or rare diseases. In this context, open-set recognition plays a vital role by identifying whether a sample belongs to one of the known classes seen during training or should be rejected as an unknown. Recent studies have shown that features learned in the later stages of deep neural networks are observed to cluster around their class means, which themselves are arranged as individual vertices of a regular simplex [32]. The proposed method introduces a loss function designed to reject samples of unknown classes effectively by penalizing open space regions using auxiliary datasets. This approach achieves significant performance gain across four MedMNIST datasets-BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, DermaMNIST, TissueMNIST and a publicly available skin dataset [29] outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: To uncover the inductive biases in image-to-3D generative models and address their strong canonical view bias, which limits generalization across viewpoints.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with simple 2D rotations on the Hunyuan3D 2.0 model. Proposed a lightweight CNN to detect and correct input orientation.

Result: State-of-the-art models struggle with rotated inputs, but a lightweight CNN restores performance without modifying the generative backbone.

Conclusion: The study questions whether scaling alone suffices and suggests exploring modular, symmetry-aware designs for better generalization.

Abstract: Despite their impressive results, large-scale image-to-3D generative models remain opaque in their inductive biases. We identify a significant limitation in image-conditioned 3D generative models: a strong canonical view bias. Through controlled experiments using simple 2D rotations, we show that the state-of-the-art Hunyuan3D 2.0 model can struggle to generalize across viewpoints, with performance degrading under rotated inputs. We show that this failure can be mitigated by a lightweight CNN that detects and corrects input orientation, restoring model performance without modifying the generative backbone. Our findings raise an important open question: Is scale enough, or should we pursue modular, symmetry-aware designs?

Motivation: Addressing the need for robust automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance in digital food applications.

Method: Comparative evaluation of a decoupled pipeline integrating EfficientNet-B4 and Gemini LLM, benchmarked against alternatives, with SEP analysis.

Result: EfficientNet-B4 offers the best accuracy-efficiency balance; Gemini excels in generative quality, but visual accuracy limits overall utility.

Conclusion: Visual front-end perceptive accuracy is the primary bottleneck, with high semantic similarity being a key failure mode.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food applications necessitates robust methods for automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of a decoupled, multimodal pipeline for food recognition. We evaluate a system integrating a specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a powerful generative large language model (Google's Gemini LLM). The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for "Semantic Error Propagation" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output. Our analysis is grounded in a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) developed to address cultural bias in public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that while EfficientNet-B4 (89.0\% Top-1 Acc.) provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, and Gemini (9.2/10 Factual Accuracy) provides superior generative quality, the system's overall utility is fundamentally bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy. We conduct a detailed per-class analysis, identifying high semantic similarity as the most critical failure mode.

Motivation: The framework addresses the challenge of 3D super-resolution without relying on high-resolution RGB guidance, simplifying the process for real-world applications where such data may not be available.

Method: It encodes 3D data into a structured 2D representation using Projected Normalized Coordinate Code (PNCC), allowing the use of 2D image super-resolution architectures. Two implementations are tested: Swin Transformers for accuracy and Vision Mamba for efficiency.

Result: The Swin Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while the Vision Mamba model offers competitive results at real-time speeds.

Conclusion: 2Dto3D-SR provides a simple, practical solution for real-time 3D super-resolution, especially useful in scenarios lacking high-resolution RGB data.

Abstract: We introduce 2Dto3D-SR, a versatile framework for real-time single-view 3D super-resolution that eliminates the need for high-resolution RGB guidance. Our framework encodes 3D data from a single viewpoint into a structured 2D representation, enabling the direct application of existing 2D image super-resolution architectures. We utilize the Projected Normalized Coordinate Code (PNCC) to represent 3D geometry from a visible surface as a regular image, thereby circumventing the complexities of 3D point-based or RGB-guided methods. This design supports lightweight and fast models adaptable to various deployment environments. We evaluate 2Dto3D-SR with two implementations: one using Swin Transformers for high accuracy, and another using Vision Mamba for high efficiency. Experiments show the Swin Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks, while the Vision Mamba model delivers competitive results at real-time speeds. This establishes our geometry-guided pipeline as a surprisingly simple yet viable and practical solution for real-world scenarios, especially where high-resolution RGB data is inaccessible.

*Eito Ogawa,Taiga Hayami,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive method for point cloud surface reconstruction that adjusts local region spacing and size based on curvature, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods uniformly place and fix the size of local regions, limiting adaptability to varying geometric complexity.

Method: The proposed method modulates local region spacing and size adaptively according to the curvature of the input point cloud.

Result: The approach enhances reconstruction accuracy and efficiency compared to uniform methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive modulation of local regions based on curvature improves point cloud surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Point cloud surface reconstruction has improved in accuracy with advances in deep learning, enabling applications such as infrastructure inspection. Recent approaches that reconstruct from small local regions rather than entire point clouds have attracted attention for their strong generalization capability. However, prior work typically places local regions uniformly and keeps their size fixed, limiting adaptability to variations in geometric complexity. In this study, we propose a method that improves reconstruction accuracy and efficiency by adaptively modulating the spacing and size of local regions based on the curvature of the input point cloud.

*Xiangyang Wu,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance multimodal alignment in vision-language fine-tuning by leveraging semantic relationships, outperforming existing methods on tasks like visual question answering and image captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods neglect semantic relationships highlighted in textual context, leading to suboptimal performance in aligning vision and language.

Method: The approach extracts multilevel semantic features from vision encoders, groups related semantics, and fuses visual-textual features using inheritable cross-attention while discarding low-correlation pairs.

Result: The method outperforms all existing techniques across eight foundation models and downstream tasks like visual question answering and image captioning.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic relationships improves multimodal alignment and fusion, enhancing performance in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient paradigm for constructing multimodal foundation models. While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods.

### [81] [Hierarchical Direction Perception via Atomic Dot-Product Operators for Rotation-Invariant Point Clouds Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08240)
*Chenyu Hu,Xiaotong Li,Hao Zhu,Biao Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPVNet introduces a Direction-Perceptive Vector Network to address rotational challenges in point cloud processing, using atomic dot-product operators for local and global directional feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arbitrary rotations disrupt point cloud directional characteristics, and existing methods fail to fully exploit multiscale directional information.

Method: DiPVNet uses Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) for local non-uniform structure capture and direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT) for global directional modeling.

Result: DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud classification and segmentation, especially under noise and large-angle rotations.

Conclusion: DiPVNet effectively combines rotational symmetry modeling with adaptive directional perception, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators. Extensive experiments on challenging scenarios involving noise and large-angle rotations demonstrate that DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

### [82] [NERVE: Neighbourhood & Entropy-guided Random-walk for training free open-Vocabulary sEgmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08248)
*Kunal Mahatha,Jose Dolz,Christian Desrosiers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NERVE proposes a training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation method that integrates global and local information using self-attention maps from a diffusion model, leveraging entropy-based uncertainty for map selection and stochastic random walks for affinity refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free OVSS methods suffer from computational inefficiency, ineffective fusion of transformer attention maps, and reliance on fixed-size kernels, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: NERVE combines neighborhood structure from self-attention layers of a diffusion model, uses stochastic random walks for affinity refinement, and selects maps via entropy-based uncertainty.

Result: NERVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance on 7 benchmarks without requiring conventional post-processing.

Conclusion: NERVE offers an efficient, effective solution for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), existing training-free methods face several limitations: use of computationally expensive affinity refinement strategies, ineffective fusion of transformer attention maps due to equal weighting or reliance on fixed-size Gaussian kernels to reinforce local spatial smoothness, enforcing isotropic neighborhoods. We propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS termed as NERVE (Neighbourhood \& Entropy-guided Random-walk for open-Vocabulary sEgmentation), which uniquely integrates global and fine-grained local information, exploiting the neighbourhood structure from the self-attention layer of a stable diffusion model. We also introduce a stochastic random walk for refining the affinity rather than relying on fixed-size Gaussian kernels for local context. This spatial diffusion process encourages propagation across connected and semantically related areas, enabling it to effectively delineate objects with arbitrary shapes. Whereas most existing approaches treat self-attention maps from different transformer heads or layers equally, our method uses entropy-based uncertainty to select the most relevant maps. Notably, our method does not require any conventional post-processing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Pixel-Adaptive Mask Refinement (PAMR). Experiments are performed on 7 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks, yielding an overall state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance, providing an effective approach to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

*Fengyi Fu,Mengqi Huang,Lei Zhang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerEdit is a novel training-free method for text-driven multi-object image editing, addressing inter-object conflicts through decomposed editing and fusion layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect critical inter-object interactions, leading to editing leakage or constraints. LayerEdit aims to resolve these issues for precise multi-object edits.

Method: LayerEdit introduces a three-step framework: conflict-aware layer decomposition, object-layered editing, and transparency-guided layer fusion.

Result: Experiments show LayerEdit outperforms existing methods, offering better controllability and coherence in multi-object edits.

Conclusion: LayerEdit successfully enables conflict-free multi-object editing through precise decomposition and fusion, validated by superior experimental results.

Abstract: Text-driven multi-object image editing which aims to precisely modify multiple objects within an image based on text descriptions, has recently attracted considerable interest. Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel "decompose-editingfusion" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of LayerEdit over existing methods, showing unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

Result: Achieves 7.3% average SSIM improvement across CVUSA, CVACT, and Auto Arborist datasets.

Conclusion: Top2Ground robustly handles wide and narrow fields of view, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Generating ground-level images from aerial views is a challenging task due to extreme viewpoint disparity, occlusions, and a limited field of view. We introduce Top2Ground, a novel diffusion-based method that directly generates photorealistic ground-view images from aerial input images without relying on intermediate representations such as depth maps or 3D voxels. Specifically, we condition the denoising process on a joint representation of VAE-encoded spatial features (derived from aerial RGB images and an estimated height map) and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. This design ensures the generation is both geometrically constrained by the scene's 3D structure and semantically consistent with its content. We evaluate Top2Ground on three diverse datasets: CVUSA, CVACT, and the Auto Arborist. Our approach shows 7.3% average improvement in SSIM across three benchmark datasets, showing Top2Ground can robustly handle both wide and narrow fields of view, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

*Yue Min,Shaobo Wang,Jiaze Li,Tianle Niu,Junxin Fan,Yongliang Miao,Lijin Yang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageBindDC introduces a novel data condensation framework using Characteristic Function loss for multimodal scenarios, outperforming previous methods with fewer condensed datapoints and faster condensation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data condensation techniques struggle in multimodal settings due to inadequate preservation of inter-modal dependencies.

Method: ImageBindDC employs Characteristic Function loss in the Fourier domain for precise statistical alignment and enforces three distributional consistency levels: uni-modal, cross-modal, and joint-modal alignment.

Result: On NYU-v2, models trained with 5 condensed datapoints per class match full dataset performance, achieving an 8.2% improvement over prior methods and 4x faster condensation.

Conclusion: ImageBindDC sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively preserving multimodal dependencies and enabling efficient model training.

Abstract: Data condensation techniques aim to synthesize a compact dataset from a larger one to enable efficient model training, yet while successful in unimodal settings, they often fail in multimodal scenarios where preserving intricate inter-modal dependencies is crucial. To address this, we introduce ImageBindDC, a novel data condensation framework operating within the unified feature space of ImageBind. Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\times$ less condensation time.

*Nan Bao,Yifan Zhao,Lin Zhu,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to improve semantic segmentation under extreme conditions by unifying event-RGB features using edge cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with RGB information loss in extreme conditions, and multi-modality approaches face feature-level mismatch between event and RGB data.

Method: The framework includes Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding to align features and Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization for fusion, leveraging edge dictionaries.

Result: The method achieves a 2.55% mIoU improvement on DERS-XS and shows resilience to spatial occlusion.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses feature heterogeneity and improves segmentation performance in extreme scenarios.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has achieved great success in ideal conditions. However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWAN is a swiping-based web app for faster histopathology image annotation, showing high annotator consistency and usability compared to traditional folder-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the slow and fatiguing nature of folder-based annotation workflows for large-scale histopathology datasets.

Method: Developed SWAN, an open-source web app with swiping gestures for intuitive patch classification, tested against folder-based workflows in a pilot study.

Result: SWAN achieved high annotator agreement (86.52%-93.68%) and usability ratings, comparable to folder-based methods.

Conclusion: SWAN offers a scalable, user-friendly alternative for faster image annotation without compromising quality.

Abstract: The annotation of large scale histopathology image datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing robust deep learning models for clinically relevant tasks, such as mitotic figure classification. Folder-based annotation workflows are usually slow, fatiguing, and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce SWipeable ANnotations (SWAN), an open-source, MIT-licensed web application that enables intuitive image patch classification using a swiping gesture. SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance. Participants rated the tool as highly usable and appreciated the ability to annotate on mobile devices. These results suggest that SWAN can accelerate image annotation while maintaining annotation quality, offering a scalable and user-friendly alternative to conventional workflows.

TL;DR: MAUGIF proposes a mechanism-aware unsupervised image fusion method using dual cross-image autoencoders to adaptively fuse multi-source images based on their inherent mechanisms, enhancing performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image fusion methods are either overly task-specific or apply uniform strategies across tasks, neglecting distinct fusion mechanisms.

Method: The method classifies fusion tasks into additive and multiplicative, uses dual encoders for shared latent space mapping, and employs mechanism-specific decoders to reintegrate modality-specific features.

Result: Extensive experiments validate MAUGIF's effectiveness and generalization across diverse fusion tasks.

Conclusion: MAUGIF successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by adapting fusion strategies to task-specific mechanisms.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate structural and complementary information from multi-source images. However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MAUGIF.

Abstract: With the advancement of meteorological instruments, abundant data has become available.

SynWeather covers four representative regions: the Continental United States, Europe, East Asia, and Tropical Cyclone regions, as well as provides high-resolution observations of key weather variables, including Composite Radar Reflectivity, Hourly Precipitation, Visible Light, and Microwave Brightness Temperature. In addition, we introduce SynWeatherDiff, a general and probabilistic weather synthesis model built upon the Diffusion Transformer framework to address the over-smoothed problem.

TL;DR: SkelSplat is a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation using differentiable Gaussian rendering, outperforming methods without 3D ground truth and showing robustness to occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving generalization in multi-view 3D human pose estimation by reducing reliance on large annotated datasets and enhancing robustness to occlusions.

Method: Models human pose as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians optimized via differentiable rendering, with a novel one-hot encoding scheme for independent joint optimization.

Result: Outperforms non-3D ground truth methods on Human3.6M and CMU, reducing cross-dataset error by up to 47.8%, and shows robustness to occlusions.

Conclusion: SkelSplat provides a promising approach for accurate and generalizable 3D human pose estimation without requiring scenario-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation is fundamental for applications such as augmented reality and human-robot interaction. State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Experiments on Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person demonstrate robustness to occlusions, without scenario-specific fine-tuning. Our project page is available here: https://skelsplat.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuSpring introduces a neural spring field for modeling deformable objects, improving reconstruction and simulation accuracy via piecewise topology and neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to generalize well for future prediction due to ignoring intrinsic physical properties of deformable objects.

Method: NeuSpring uses a piecewise topology solution for multi-region spring connections and a neural spring field for physical property representation.

Result: Achieves 20% and 25% improvements in Chamfer distance for current state modeling and future prediction, respectively.

Conclusion: NeuSpring outperforms existing methods by leveraging realistic physical simulation and spatial associativity.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to create physical digital twins of deformable objects under interaction. Existing methods focus more on the physical learning of current state modeling, but generalize worse to future prediction. This is because existing methods ignore the intrinsic physical properties of deformable objects, resulting in the limited physical learning in the current state modeling. To address this, we present NeuSpring, a neural spring field for the reconstruction and simulation of deformable objects from videos. Built upon spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, our method consists of two major innovations: 1) a piecewise topology solution that efficiently models multi-region spring connection topologies using zero-order optimization, which considers the material heterogeneity of real-world objects. 2) a neural spring field that represents spring physical properties across different frames using a canonical coordinate-based neural network, which effectively leverages the spatial associativity of springs for physical learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our NeuSping achieves superior reconstruction and simulation performance for current state modeling and future prediction, with Chamfer distance improved by 20% and 25%, respectively.

*Simone Ricci,Niccolò Biondi,Federico Pernici,Alberto Del Bimbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method to reduce inconsistencies (negative flips) in AI systems by preserving margins and using double-source focal distillation, maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing negative flips in AI systems is vital, especially as adding new classes reduces margins and introduces conflicts, degrading performance on original classes.

Method: Proposes margin-calibration on logits and integrates double-source focal distillation to balance margins and accuracy for new and old classes.

Result: Demonstrates consistent reduction in negative flip rates while maintaining high overall accuracy in image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates negative flips without sacrificing accuracy, benefiting evolving AI systems.

Abstract: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive versions of an AI system is as crucial as reducing the overall error. In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy.

TL;DR: Deep learning-based risk models for breast cancer screening benefit most from image-based registration over feature-based or implicit alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early breast cancer detection by enhancing the accuracy of personalized screening intervals using longitudinal mammograms.

Method: Evaluated various alignment strategies (image-based registration, feature-level alignment, implicit alignment) using two large-scale datasets and key metrics like predictive accuracy and deformation field quality.

Result: Image-based registration consistently outperformed other methods, providing more accurate predictions and smoother deformation fields. Feature-level alignment with regularization improved deformation quality but reduced prediction performance.

Conclusion: Image-based deformation fields are crucial for accurate spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering better prediction accuracy and robustness for personalized screening.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is crucial for early breast cancer detection. By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.
  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of underwater instance segmentation (UIS) by utilizing DINO's advanced pretrained features and introducing domain-specific adaptations.

Method: DiveSeg integrates AquaStyle Aligner for underwater color style adaptation and ObjectPrior Prompter for providing object-level priors, enhancing DINO's performance on UIS.

Result: Experiments on UIIS and USIS10K datasets show DiveSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DiveSeg successfully adapts DINO for UIS, demonstrating its effectiveness through innovative components and superior results.

Abstract: Underwater instance segmentation (UIS), integrating pixel-level understanding and instance-level discrimination, is a pivotal technology in marine resource exploration and ecological protection. In recent years, large-scale pretrained visual foundation models, exemplified by DINO, have advanced rapidly and demonstrated remarkable performance on complex downstream tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that DINO can serve as an effective feature learner for UIS, and we introduce DiveSeg, a novel framework built upon two insightful components: (1) The AquaStyle Aligner, designed to embed underwater color style features into the DINO fine-tuning process, facilitating better adaptation to the underwater domain. (2) The ObjectPrior Prompter, which incorporates binary segmentation-based prompts to deliver object-level priors, provides essential guidance for instance segmentation task that requires both object- and instance-level reasoning. We conduct thorough experiments on the popular UIIS and USIS10K datasets, and the results show that DiveSeg achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code: https://github.com/ettof/Diveseg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SASG-DA, a diffusion-based data augmentation method for sEMG-based gesture recognition, enhancing faithfulness and diversity to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing poor generalization in sEMG-based systems due to limited training data by proposing a novel augmentation approach.

Method: Uses Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG), Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS), and Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling for faithful and diverse sample generation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7 datasets, improving recognition and generalization.

Conclusion: SASG-DA effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances performance by generating faithful and diverse training samples.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interaction (HMI), particularly for rehabilitation and prosthetic control. However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoChain is a new Multi-hop Video Question Generation framework that generates reasoning-intensive questions across video segments, outperforming benchmarks in multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-hop question generation is limited to text, and video question generation lacks multi-hop reasoning. VideoChain bridges this gap.

Method: VideoChain uses a modular BART-based architecture with video embeddings to capture textual and visual dependencies, leveraging the TVQA+ dataset for scalability.

Result: VideoChain achieves high scores: ROUGE-L (0.6454), ROUGE-1 (0.6854), BLEU-1 (0.6711), BERTScore-F1 (0.7967), and semantic similarity (0.8110).

Conclusion: VideoChain demonstrates strong performance in generating coherent, contextually grounded, and reasoning-intensive multi-hop video questions.

Abstract: Multi-hop Question Generation (QG) effectively evaluates reasoning but remains confined to text; Video Question Generation (VideoQG) is limited to zero-hop questions over single segments. To address this, we introduce VideoChain, a novel Multi-hop Video Question Generation (MVQG) framework designed to generate questions that require reasoning across multiple, temporally separated video segments. VideoChain features a modular architecture built on a modified BART backbone enhanced with video embeddings, capturing textual and visual dependencies. Using the TVQA+ dataset, we automatically construct the large-scale MVQ-60 dataset by merging zero-hop QA pairs, ensuring scalability and diversity. Evaluations show VideoChain's strong performance across standard generation metrics: ROUGE-L (0.6454), ROUGE-1 (0.6854), BLEU-1 (0.6711), BERTScore-F1 (0.7967), and semantic similarity (0.8110). These results highlight the model's ability to generate coherent, contextually grounded, and reasoning-intensive questions.

*Dan Liu,Nikita Dvornik,Xue Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLOPE combines structured sparsity and low-bit quantization to reduce DNN size while maintaining accuracy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs' large size and high computational cost limit their use on resource-constrained devices. Current techniques like quantization and sparsity are effective alone but harm accuracy when combined.

Method: SLOPE introduces a training-time regularization strategy to align full-precision weights with sparse, quantized counterparts, focusing on angular alignment.

Result: SLOPE achieves ~20x model size reduction with ~99% original accuracy on ResNet-18 and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across tasks.

Conclusion: SLOPE provides a principled way to combine sparsity and quantization, enabling efficient DNN deployment with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in many applications, but their large size and high computational cost make them hard to run on devices with limited resources. Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching. On ResNet-18, SLOPE achieves $\sim20\times$ model size reduction while retaining $\sim$99% of the original accuracy. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on models such as ResNet-18, ViT-Small, and Mask R-CNN.

*Qi Wang,Veronika Ecker,Marcel Früh,Sergios Gatidis,Thomas Küstner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical VQ variational auto-encoder is proposed for MRI motion correction, learning disentangled motion-to-clean image features without requiring artifact-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML-based MRI motion correction methods struggle with generalization across different motion types and body regions, prompting the need for a more versatile solution.

Method: A hierarchical VQ variational auto-encoder learns disentangled embeddings of motion-to-clean image features using a codebook for motion patterns at multiple resolutions, combined with an auto-regressive model.

Result: The method shows robust correction across varying motion severity and effectively disentangles motion patterns, improving generalization.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for broader application across anatomical regions and motion types.

Abstract: Physiological motion can affect the diagnostic quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction. Our work of disentangling the motion features shed a light on its potential application across anatomical regions and motion types.

### [99] [A Circular Argument : Does RoPE need to be Equivariant for Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08368)
*Chase van de Geijn,Timo Lüddecke,Polina Turishcheva,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper generalizes Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) to higher-dimensional data, questions the necessity of strict equivariance, and proposes Spherical RoPE as a non-equivariant alternative with promising empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the generalization of RoPE to higher-dimensional data (e.g., images, videos) and investigates whether strict positional equivariance is crucial for RoPE's effectiveness.

Method: The authors mathematically analyze RoPE's equivariance properties and propose Mixed RoPE (equivariant) and Spherical RoPE (non-equivariant) as generalizations for M-dimensional data. Empirical comparisons are conducted.

Result: Spherical RoPE, despite lacking strict equivariance, performs equivalently or better than its equivariant counterparts, suggesting relative positional embeddings may not be as critical as assumed in computer vision.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the common belief in the necessity of relative positional embeddings and may inspire faster, more generalizable positional encoding methods for vision tasks.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) have emerged as a highly effective technique for one-dimensional sequences in Natural Language Processing spurring recent progress towards generalizing RoPE to higher-dimensional data such as images and videos. The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend text-based person retrieval to include aerial and ground views, addressing practical challenges due to viewpoint heterogeneity.

Method: The method includes constructing the TAG-PEDES dataset with diverse text descriptions and developing TAG-CLIP, a framework with a mixture of experts module and viewpoint decoupling strategy for feature learning.

Result: TAG-CLIP is evaluated on TAG-PEDES and existing benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in handling view heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that TAG-PR, with its dataset and framework, successfully addresses the challenges of cross-view person retrieval using text descriptions.

Abstract: This work introduces Text-based Aerial-Ground Person Retrieval (TAG-PR), which aims to retrieve person images from heterogeneous aerial and ground views with textual descriptions. Unlike traditional Text-based Person Retrieval (T-PR), which focuses solely on ground-view images, TAG-PR introduces greater practical significance and presents unique challenges due to the large viewpoint discrepancy across images. To support this task, we contribute: (1) TAG-PEDES dataset, constructed from public benchmarks with automatically generated textual descriptions, enhanced by a diversified text generation paradigm to ensure robustness under view heterogeneity; and (2) TAG-CLIP, a novel retrieval framework that addresses view heterogeneity through a hierarchically-routed mixture of experts module to learn view-specific and view-agnostic features and a viewpoint decoupling strategy to decouple view-specific features for better cross-modal alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAG-CLIP on both the proposed TAG-PEDES dataset and existing T-PR benchmarks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/TAG-PR.

TL;DR: RAPTR is a weakly supervised method for radar-based 3D human pose estimation using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels, outperforming existing methods with significant error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of fine-grained 3D keypoint labels in radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation.

Method: Uses a two-stage pose decoder with pseudo-3D deformable attention: initial pose estimation with 3D BBox labels and refinement with 2D keypoint labels.

Result: Reduces joint position error by 34.3% on HIBER and 76.9% on MMVR compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: RAPTR demonstrates effectiveness in weakly supervised 3D pose estimation with scalable label collection.

Abstract: Radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation typically relied on fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are costly to obtain especially in complex indoor settings involving clutter, occlusions, or multiple people. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RAPTR} (RAdar Pose esTimation using tRansformer) under weak supervision, using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels which are considerably easier and more scalable to collect. Our RAPTR is characterized by a two-stage pose decoder architecture with a pseudo-3D deformable attention to enhance (pose/joint) queries with multi-view radar features: a pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses with a 3D template loss designed to utilize the 3D BBox labels and mitigate depth ambiguities; and a joint decoder refines the initial poses with 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss. Evaluated on two indoor radar datasets, RAPTR outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by $34.3\%$ on HIBER and $76.9\%$ on MMVR.

TL;DR: Anatomy-VLM is a fine-grained vision-language model integrating multi-scale medical imaging details and structured knowledge for expert-level disease diagnosis, outperforming traditional VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs treat images holistically, missing fine-grained details crucial for disease diagnosis. Clinicians use multi-scale analysis and prior knowledge, motivating Anatomy-VLM's design.

Method: Anatomy-VLM localizes anatomical ROIs, enriches them with structured knowledge, and aligns multi-scale information for clinically-interpretable predictions.

Result: It excels on in- and out-of-distribution datasets and downstream tasks like segmentation, demonstrating superior clinical interpretation and zero-shot anatomy-wise analysis.

Conclusion: Anatomy-VLM's fine-grained alignment and knowledge integration enable expert-level diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, advancing medical imaging AI.

Abstract: Accurate disease interpretation from radiology remains challenging due to imaging heterogeneity. Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.

*Yuncheng Guo,Junyan Ye,Chenjue Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Haohuan Fu,Conghui He,Weijia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAID proposes a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts framework to improve AIGI detection by separating content-specific flaws from universal artifacts, validated with a new dataset, Mirage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGI detectors generalize poorly due to entangled representations and outdated benchmarks.

Method: OmniAID uses a hybrid expert system with specialized semantic experts and a universal artifact expert, trained via a two-stage strategy.

Result: OmniAID outperforms existing detectors on traditional benchmarks and the new Mirage dataset.

Conclusion: OmniAID sets a robust standard for AIGI detection by addressing generalization and benchmark limitations.

Abstract: A truly universal AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detector must simultaneously generalize across diverse generative models and varied semantic content. Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation--conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts--and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system engineered to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) these content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a bespoke two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling "what is generated" (content-specific flaws) from "how it is generated" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new, robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid consistency learning method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation using Cross-Pyramid Consistency Regularization (CPCR) between two decoders in a Dual Branch Pyramid Network (DBPNet).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited labeled data in medical image segmentation by effectively leveraging unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning.

Method: Proposes DBPNet with an encoder and two slightly different decoders, and CPCR learning strategy combining consistency learning, uncertainty minimization, and a novel regularization term for pyramid predictions.

Result: DBPNet with CPCR outperforms five state-of-the-art SSL methods and matches recent ones on a public benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach proves effective for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enables training of powerful models with the assumption of limited, carefully labelled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to support the learning. In this paper, we propose a hybrid consistency learning approach to effectively exploit unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation by leveraging Cross-Pyramid Consistency Regularization (CPCR) between two decoders. First, we design a hybrid Dual Branch Pyramid Network (DBPNet), consisting of an encoder and two decoders that differ slightly, each producing a pyramid of perturbed auxiliary predictions across multiple resolution scales. Second, we present a learning strategy for this network named CPCR that combines existing consistency learning and uncertainty minimization approaches on the main output predictions of decoders with our novel regularization term. More specifically, in this term, we extend the soft-labeling setting to pyramid predictions across decoders to support knowledge distillation in deep hierarchical features. Experimental results show that DBPNet with CPCR outperforms five state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and has comparable performance with recent ones on a public benchmark dataset.

Motivation: To enhance vision-language tasks by decoupling comprehensive understanding and discriminative feature optimization, improving efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase as a warm-up for contrastive learning, using minimal data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMEB with VLMs of comparable size, balancing efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoMa successfully optimizes vision-language models for downstream tasks, demonstrating its superiority in both speed and performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models advance multimodal representation learning by acquiring transferable semantic embeddings, thereby substantially enhancing performance across a range of vision-language tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model. CoMa achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on the MMEB, realizing optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness.

TL;DR: A novel fast multi-organ segmentation framework using hierarchical sparse sampling and Residual Transformer reduces computation time while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between speed and accuracy in 3D medical image segmentation.

Method: Hierarchical sparse sampling and Residual Transformer architecture.

Result: Improved performance (~2.24 seconds on CPU) compared to current methods.

Conclusion: Potential for real-time fine organ segmentation demonstrated.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation of 3D medical images is fundamental with meaningful applications in various clinical automation pipelines. Although deep learning has achieved superior performance, the time and memory consumption of segmenting the entire 3D volume voxel by voxel using neural networks can be huge. Classifiers have been developed as an alternative in cases with certain points of interest, but the trade-off between speed and accuracy remains an issue. Thus, we propose a novel fast multi-organ segmentation framework with the usage of hierarchical sparse sampling and a Residual Transformer. Compared with whole-volume analysis, the hierarchical sparse sampling strategy could successfully reduce computation time while preserving a meaningful hierarchical context utilizing multiple resolution levels. The architecture of the Residual Transformer segmentation network could extract and combine information from different levels of information in the sparse descriptor while maintaining a low computational cost. In an internal data set containing 10,253 CT images and the public dataset TotalSegmentator, the proposed method successfully improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance compared to the current fast organ classifier, with fast speed at the level of ~2.24 seconds on CPU hardware. The potential of achieving real-time fine organ segmentation is suggested.

We release this dataset to support the development and evaluation of new methods for visual knowledge tracing. We show that tracking learners' knowledge is challenging, especially across participant subgroups and question types, with different forms of contextual information offering varying degrees of predictive benefit. CleverBirds is among the largest benchmark of its kind, offering a substantially higher number of learnable concepts.

Conclusion: UniVA and UniVA-Bench aim to advance interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence.

Abstract: While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: LSLM is a framework using LLMs to translate 3D ASL, improving accuracy and inclusivity for hearing-impaired individuals by capturing spatial and gestural details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired by leveraging 3D data and LLMs, moving beyond traditional 2D methods.

Method: Utilizes 3D sign language data for richer spatial and gestural information, integrating it with LLMs for direct translation or instruction-guided modulation.

Result: Enables more accurate and flexible ASL translation, advancing multimodal understanding in LLMs.

Conclusion: LSLM lays groundwork for inclusive multimodal systems that interpret diverse languages beyond text.

Abstract: We present Large Sign Language Models (LSLM), a novel framework for translating 3D American Sign Language (ASL) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone, which can benefit hearing-impaired individuals' virtual communication. Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.

*Sriram Srinivasan,Gautam Ramachandra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for robust 3D mesh reconstruction from multi-view images with noisy camera poses, improving NeRF-based methods by refining poses and creating editable meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D reconstruction is critical for robotics, but existing NeRF-based methods struggle with noisy extrinsic parameters and inefficient mesh compatibility.

Method: Jointly refines camera poses and learns an implicit scene representation to produce high-quality, editable meshes.

Result: Achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, compatible with standard 3D tools.

Conclusion: The method bridges neural implicit representations and practical robotics applications, enhancing usability.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is essential for downstream robotic tasks such as navigation, manipulation, and environment understanding. However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, bridging the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications.

### [113] [SENCA-st: Integrating Spatial Transcriptomics and Histopathology with Cross Attention Shared Encoder for Region Identification in Cancer Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08573)
*Shanaka Liyanaarachchi,Chathurya Wijethunga,Shihab Aaquil Ahamed,Akthas Absar,Ranga Rodrigo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SENCA-st, a novel architecture integrating histopathology and spatial transcriptomics to preserve features of both modalities, outperforming existing methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and micro-environment regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either overly prioritize spatial transcriptomics or histopathology, losing essential functional or structural information. The goal is to develop a balanced approach that integrates both modalities effectively.

Method: The proposed SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) uses cross-attention to highlight regions structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different in spatial transcriptomics.

Result: SENCA-st outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and micro-environment regions, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: SENCA-st effectively integrates histopathology and spatial transcriptomics, preserving essential features of both modalities and improving detection of clinically relevant tumor regions.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging field that enables the identification of functional regions based on the spatial distribution of gene expression. Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.

*Parshwa Shah,Dhaval K. Patel,Brijesh Soni,Miguel López-Benítez,Siddhartan Govindasamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) for UE positioning using CSI, addressing issues of equal attention weighting and non-sequential data handling. It outperforms existing methods by ~38%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Learning models for UE positioning often treat all input equally and struggle with non-sequential data like instantaneous CSI. The paper aims to improve this by focusing on ADP from CSI.

Method: An attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture is proposed, focusing on Angle Delay Profile (ADP) extracted from CSI matrices.

Result: Tested on DeepMIMO and ViWi datasets, the model achieves RMSE of 0.55m indoors and 13.59m outdoors (DeepMIMO), and 3.45m outdoors (ViWi). It outperforms state-of-the-art by ~38%.

Conclusion: The proposed ViT-based approach significantly improves UE positioning accuracy, especially in non-sequential CSI scenarios, outperforming other methods.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for User Equipment (UE) positioning. However, the key shortcomings of such models is that: i) they weigh the same attention to the entire input; ii) they are not well suited for the non-sequential data e.g., when only instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) is available. In this context, we propose an attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that focuses on the Angle Delay Profile (ADP) from CSI matrix. Our approach, validated on the `DeepMIMO' and `ViWi' ray-tracing datasets, achieves an Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.55m indoors, 13.59m outdoors in DeepMIMO, and 3.45m in ViWi's outdoor blockage scenario. The proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by $\sim$ 38\%. It also performs substantially better than other approaches that we have considered in terms of the distribution of error distance.

Method: The study applies a RAG pipeline to two Traditional Chinese datasets (Fort Zeelandia and Taiwan Provincial Council Gazette) and analyzes query characteristics and metadata integration strategies.

Result: Early-stage metadata integration improves retrieval and answer accuracy, but challenges like hallucinations and handling temporal/multi-hop queries persist.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates RAG's potential for historical archives but underscores unresolved challenges.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, few studies have examined RAG for Taiwanese Historical Archives. In this paper, we present an initial study of a RAG pipeline applied to two historical Traditional Chinese datasets, Fort Zeelandia and the Taiwan Provincial Council Gazette, along with their corresponding open-ended query sets. We systematically investigate the effects of query characteristics and metadata integration strategies on retrieval quality, answer generation, and the performance of the overall system. The results show that early-stage metadata integration enhances both retrieval and answer accuracy while also revealing persistent challenges for RAG systems, including hallucinations during generation and difficulties in handling temporal or multi-hop historical queries.

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' role in scientific ideation, categorizing methods into five families and analyzing them using Boden's and Rhodes' frameworks to guide future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and enhancing LLMs' inconsistent creative capacity in generating novel and sound scientific ideas.

Method: Survey synthesizes LLM-driven scientific ideation methods into five categories, analyzed via Boden's and Rhodes' creativity frameworks.

Result: Identified five method families and frameworks to clarify LLMs' potential and limitations in scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Framework alignment helps outline reliable and transformative LLM applications for scientific ideation.

Abstract: Scientific idea generation lies at the heart of scientific discovery and has driven human progress-whether by solving unsolved problems or proposing novel hypotheses to explain unknown phenomena. Unlike standard scientific reasoning or general creative generation, idea generation in science is a multi-objective and open-ended task, where the novelty of a contribution is as essential as its empirical soundness. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising generators of scientific ideas, capable of producing coherent and factual outputs with surprising intuition and acceptable reasoning, yet their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood. This survey provides a structured synthesis of methods for LLM-driven scientific ideation, examining how different approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness. We categorize existing methods into five complementary families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. To interpret their contributions, we employ two complementary frameworks: Boden's taxonomy of Combinatorial, Exploratory and Transformational creativity to characterize the level of ideas each family expected to generate, and Rhodes' 4Ps framework-Person, Process, Press, and Product-to locate the aspect or source of creativity that each method emphasizes. By aligning methodological advances with creativity frameworks, this survey clarifies the state of the field and outlines key directions toward reliable, systematic, and transformative applications of LLMs in scientific discovery.

*Jiarui Feng,Donghong Cai,Yixin Chen,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRIP enables LLMs to internalize graph-structured data efficiently via lightweight fine-tuning, avoiding complex preprocessing and improving performance across graph-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with integrating structural data (e.g., graphs) into LLMs due to token overhead, scalability issues, or poor modality alignment.

Method: GRIP uses fine-tuning tasks to embed graph knowledge into LLMs via lightweight LoRA parameters, eliminating the need for graph access during inference.

Result: Experiments show GRIP outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and efficiency on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GRIP provides a scalable and efficient solution for LLMs to handle structural data without extensive preprocessing or alignment challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling sequential textual data and generalizing across diverse tasks. However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like ROUGE and BLEU fail due to their reliance on lexical overlap and lack of high-quality reference summaries.

Method: Introduced REFLEX, leveraging LLMs as zero-shot evaluators to measure summary quality in relevance, informativeness, and coherence.

Result: REFLEX offers stable, interpretable evaluations, distinguishing model outputs better than traditional metrics across datasets.

Conclusion: REFLEX is scalable and effective for evaluating log summaries where reference data is limited or absent.

Abstract: Evaluating log summarization systems is challenging due to the lack of high-quality reference summaries and the limitations of existing metrics like ROUGE and BLEU, which depend on surface-level lexical overlap. We introduce REFLEX, a reference-free evaluation metric for log summarization based on large language model (LLM) judgment. REFLEX uses LLMs as zero-shot evaluators to assess summary quality along dimensions such as relevance, informativeness, and coherence, without requiring gold-standard references or human annotations. We show that REFLEX produces stable, interpretable, and fine-grained evaluations across multiple log summarization dataset, and more effectively distinguishes model outputs than traditional metrics. REFLEX provides a scalable alternative for evaluating log summaries in real-world settings where reference data is scarce or unavailable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve terminology-constrained machine translation by leveraging the strengths of both NMT and LLMs for flexible, context-aware terminology handling.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) fine-tuned NMT model on synthetic data, (2) LLM post-editing for refinement and terminology adherence.

Result: Evaluated on English-to-German/Spanish/Russian, DuTerm shows LLMs perform better as context-driven refiners than strict generators, yielding higher quality translations.

Conclusion: LLMs are more effective as mutators than generators in terminology-constrained translation, highlighting a critical trade-off.

Abstract: This paper introduces DuTerm, a novel two-stage architecture for terminology-constrained machine translation. Our system combines a terminology-aware NMT model, adapted via fine-tuning on large-scale synthetic data, with a prompt-based LLM for post-editing. The LLM stage refines NMT output and enforces terminology adherence. We evaluate DuTerm on English-to German, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-Russian with the WMT 2025 Terminology Shared Task corpus. We demonstrate that flexible, context-driven terminology handling by the LLM consistently yields higher quality translations than strict constraint enforcement. Our results highlight a critical trade-off, revealing that an LLM's work best for high-quality translation as context-driven mutators rather than generators.

Conclusion: Thoughtful architectural scaling and training design can achieve efficiency and performance competitive with larger models.

Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B, a new open-weight foundation model that pushes the efficiency frontier of large language models by combining architectural innovation with system-level optimization. Designed for scalable language understanding and robust instruction generalization under constrained compute budgets, Motif-2-12.7B builds upon Motif-2.6B with the integration of Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), which improves representational efficiency by disentangling signal and noise-control attention pathways. The model is pre-trained on 5.5 trillion tokens spanning diverse linguistic, mathematical, scientific, and programming domains using a curriculum-driven data scheduler that gradually changes the data composition ratio. The training system leverages the MuonClip optimizer alongside custom high-performance kernels, including fused PolyNorm activations and the Parallel Muon algorithm, yielding significant throughput and memory efficiency gains in large-scale distributed environments. Post-training employs a three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline that successively enhances general instruction adherence, compositional understanding, and linguistic precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of multi-head self-attention (MHA) in multilingual large language models (LLMs), introducing LAHIS to identify language-specific and general attention heads, and proposes a lightweight adaptation to improve multilingual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MHA contributes to multilingual capabilities in LLMs and enhance both interpretability and performance.

Method: Introduces Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS) to identify important attention heads and a lightweight adaptation with a soft head mask.

Result: Reveals language-specific and general heads, improves XQuAD accuracy with minimal parameters.

Conclusion: The work advances interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs through MHA analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support multilingual understanding and generation. Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA.

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizations for Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) to reduce latency in LLM-based reranking, achieving up to 166x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high computational demands and latency of LLM-based reranking methods, making them viable for real-time applications.

Method: Optimizations include using smaller models, limiting reranked sets, lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens.

Result: Latency improved dramatically (61.36s to 0.37s per query) with negligible drop in Recall@k performance.

Conclusion: Careful optimization enhances feasibility of LLM-based reranking for latency-sensitive deployments.

Abstract: Efficiently reranking documents retrieved from information retrieval (IR) pipelines to enhance overall quality of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system remains an important yet challenging problem. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens. These optimizations make LLM-based reranking substantially more efficient and feasible for latency-sensitive, real-world deployments.

*Ratna Kandala,Katie Hoemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dutch-specific LLMs underperformed traditional lexicon-based tools like LIWC and Pattern in predicting valence in Flemish spontaneous narratives, despite their advanced architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs outperform traditional tools in understanding emotional valence in low-resource language variants like Flemish.

Method: Evaluated three Dutch-specific LLMs against LIWC and Pattern using a dataset of 25000 spontaneous texts from Dutch speakers with self-assessed valence ratings.

Result: Dutch-tuned LLMs performed worse than traditional methods, with Pattern being the most effective.

Conclusion: LLMs may not yet surpass traditional tools for nuanced emotion analysis, highlighting the need for tailored frameworks for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Understanding emotional nuances in everyday language is crucial for computational linguistics and emotion research. While traditional lexicon-based tools like LIWC and Pattern have served as foundational instruments, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise enhanced context understanding. We evaluated three Dutch-specific LLMs (ChocoLlama-8B-Instruct, Reynaerde-7B-chat, and GEITje-7B-ultra) against LIWC and Pattern for valence prediction in Flemish, a low-resource language variant. Our dataset comprised approximately 25000 spontaneous textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants, each providing narratives about their current experiences with self-assessed valence ratings (-50 to +50). Surprisingly, despite architectural advancements, the Dutch-tuned LLMs underperformed compared to traditional methods, with Pattern showing superior performance. These findings challenge assumptions about LLM superiority in sentiment analysis tasks and highlight the complexity of capturing emotional valence in spontaneous, real-world narratives. Our results underscore the need for developing culturally and linguistically tailored evaluation frameworks for low-resource language variants, while questioning whether current LLM fine-tuning approaches adequately address the nuanced emotional expressions found in everyday language use.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using lightweight Natural Language Inference (NLI) scoring with a lexical-match flag for evaluating LLM answers, matching GPT-4o's accuracy while being computationally cheaper. It introduces DIVER-QA, a human-annotated benchmark for testing metric alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating LLM answers lack efficiency or nuance, prompting the need for a lightweight yet accurate alternative.

Method: The study re-evaluates NLI scoring with a lexical-match flag and tests it against GPT-4o on long-form QA. It also introduces DIVER-QA, a new benchmark for human-aligned metric evaluation.

Result: NLI-based evaluation matches GPT-4o's accuracy (89.9%) while being far less resource-intensive.

Conclusion: Lightweight NLI scoring remains competitive for LLM answer evaluation, and DIVER-QA serves as a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Evaluating answers from state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) is challenging: lexical metrics miss semantic nuances, whereas "LLM-as-Judge" scoring is computationally expensive. We re-evaluate a lightweight alternative -- off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) scoring augmented by a simple lexical-match flag and find that this decades-old technique matches GPT-4o's accuracy (89.9%) on long-form QA, while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters. To test human alignment of these metrics rigorously, we introduce DIVER-QA, a new 3000-sample human-annotated benchmark spanning five QA datasets and five candidate LLMs. Our results highlight that inexpensive NLI-based evaluation remains competitive and offer DIVER-QA as an open resource for future metric research.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates six reference-free factuality metrics for long-document summarization, revealing inconsistencies and declining reliability, especially for information-dense claims, and suggests improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing factual consistency in long-document summarization is challenging due to input length limitations and long-range dependencies.

Method: Evaluated six metrics using seven factuality-preserving perturbations on summaries, analyzing sensitivity to retrieval context and claim density.

Result: Existing metrics showed inconsistent scores for equivalent summaries and reduced reliability for dense claims; expanding retrieval context helped only in some domains.

Conclusion: Improvements like multi-span reasoning and context-aware calibration are needed for robust long-form summarization evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization remains a significant challenge, particularly for long documents, where conventional metrics struggle with input length limitations and long-range dependencies. In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization. We release all code, perturbed data, and scripts required to reproduce our results at https://github.com/zainmujahid/metricEval-longSum.

### [126] [CAPO: Confidence Aware Preference Optimization Learning for Multilingual Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07691)
*Rhitabrat Pokharel,Yufei Tao,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAPO introduces a dynamic loss scaling mechanism for multilingual preference optimization, outperforming DPO by 16% in reward accuracy and improving alignment across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DPO struggle in multilingual settings due to fixed treatment of preference pairs, lacking robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons.

Method: CAPO replaces DPO's fixed approach with dynamic loss scaling based on relative reward, modulating learning signals according to confidence in each preference pair.

Result: CAPO achieves at least 16% higher reward accuracy than baselines and enhances alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses.

Conclusion: CAPO is a simple, effective alternative to DPO for multilingual preference optimization, offering improved robustness and performance.

Abstract: Preference optimization is a critical post-training technique used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, typically by fine-tuning on ranked response pairs. While methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have proven effective in English, they often fail to generalize robustly to multilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.

### [127] [Critical Confabulation: Can LLMs Hallucinate for Social Good?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07722)
*Peiqi Sui,Eamon Duede,Hoyt Long,Richard Jean So*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores leveraging LLM hallucinations ('critical confabulation') to reconstruct hidden historical narratives by filling gaps in archives, demonstrating potential for socially useful applications while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address omissions in historical archives caused by inequality, using LLM hallucinations to create plausible, evidence-bound narratives for underrepresented figures.

Method: An open-ended narrative cloze task simulates archival gaps, prompting LLMs to generate masked events in character timelines from unpublished texts. Audited and unaudited models (OLMo-2 family and baselines) are evaluated under controlled prompts.

Result: LLMs show strong narrative understanding for critical confabulation, enabling controlled hallucinations that aid knowledge production without sacrificing historical accuracy.

Conclusion: Carefully bounded LLM hallucinations can reconstruct hidden historical narratives, offering valuable applications while preserving fidelity.

Abstract: LLMs hallucinate, yet some confabulations can have social affordances if carefully bounded. We propose critical confabulation (inspired by critical fabulation from literary and social theory), the use of LLM hallucinations to "fill-in-the-gap" for omissions in archives due to social and political inequality, and reconstruct divergent yet evidence-bound narratives for history's "hidden figures". We simulate these gaps with an open-ended narrative cloze task: asking LLMs to generate a masked event in a character-centric timeline sourced from a novel corpus of unpublished texts. We evaluate audited (for data contamination), fully-open models (the OLMo-2 family) and unaudited open-weight and proprietary baselines under a range of prompts designed to elicit controlled and useful hallucinations. Our findings validate LLMs' foundational narrative understanding capabilities to perform critical confabulation, and show how controlled and well-specified hallucinations can support LLM applications for knowledge production without collapsing speculation into a lack of historical accuracy and fidelity.

### [128] [Back to the Future: The Role of Past and Future Context Predictability in Incremental Language Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07752)
*Shiva Upadhye,Richard Futrell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of backward predictability (a word given its future context) on word choice and production, using improved measures and language models. It introduces a new predictability measure integrating past and future context, studying word duration and substitution errors to understand lexical planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the poorly-understood backward predictability effect in naturalistic language production, particularly its relation to future planning, and to bridge gaps between predictability effects and sentence planning mechanisms.

Method: Two studies of naturalistic speech corpora were conducted: one revisiting predictability effects on word duration, and another investigating substitution errors using a generative framework. A new information-theoretic predictability measure integrating past and future context was introduced.

Result: The proposed backward predictability measure yielded qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Analysis of substitution errors revealed insights into how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context during lexical planning.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the roles of past and future context in word encoding and choice, bridging predictability effects with sentence planning mechanisms and illuminating functional aspects of lexical planning.

Abstract: Contextual predictability shapes both the form and choice of words in online language production. The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning.

*Hua Zhou,Bing Ma,Yufei Zhang,Yi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CUFEInse v1.0, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models in the insurance field, highlighting its methodology, results, and implications for future model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of professional evaluation benchmarks in the insurance domain and identify common bottlenecks of large language models in specialized scenarios.

Method: CUFEInse v1.0 uses a quantitative-oriented, expert-driven approach with a multi-dimensional evaluation system (5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, 14,430 questions). It evaluates 11 mainstream models.

Result: General-purpose models struggle with actuarial capabilities and compliance, while domain-specific models excel in vertical scenarios but lag in business adaptation. The benchmark identifies key bottlenecks in insurance-specific tasks.

Conclusion: CUFEInse fills a critical gap in insurance evaluation, offering a professional tool for academia and industry. Its methodology also provides insights for vertical model evaluation and future development directions.

Abstract: This paper comprehensively elaborates on the construction methodology, multi-dimensional evaluation system, and underlying design philosophy of CUFEInse v1.0. Adhering to the principles of "quantitative-oriented, expert-driven, and multi-validation," the benchmark establishes an evaluation framework covering 5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, and 14,430 high-quality questions, encompassing insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor. Based on this benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 11 mainstream large language models. The evaluation results reveal that general-purpose models suffer from common bottlenecks such as weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation. High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection. Finally, the paper looks forward to the future iteration direction of the evaluation benchmark and the core development direction of "domain adaptation + reasoning enhancement" for insurance large models.

*Siyu Xia,Zekun Xu,Jiajun Chai,Wentian Fan,Yan Song,Xiaohan Wang,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a trainable graph memory framework to enhance LLM agents' reasoning by structuring experiences into adaptable, interpretable strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM agents' reasoning by addressing limitations of implicit and explicit memory methods.

Method: Proposes a multi-layered graph memory framework and reinforcement-based weight optimization for adaptable strategies.

Result: The framework improves LLMs' strategic reasoning and generalization in RL tasks.

Conclusion: The graph memory enhances LLM agents' performance by making their reasoning more adaptable and interpretable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomous task-solving across complex, open-ended environments. A promising approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents is to better utilize prior experiences in guiding current decisions. However, LLMs acquire experience either through implicit memory via training, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability, or explicit memory via prompting, which lacks adaptability. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework and evaluate how context memory enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize parametric information. The graph abstracts raw agent trajectories into structured decision paths in a state machine and further distills them into high-level, human-interpretable strategic meta-cognition. In order to make memory adaptable, we propose a reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure that estimates the empirical utility of each meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. These optimized strategies are then dynamically integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting. Empirically, the learnable graph memory delivers robust generalization, improves LLM agents' strategic reasoning performance, and provides consistent benefits during Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.

*Chenxi Lin,Weikang Yuan,Zhuoren Jiang,Biao Huang,Ruitao Zhang,Jianan Ge,Yueqian Xu,Jianxing Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignSurvey is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in social surveys, addressing challenges like bias and adaptability. It includes tasks, datasets, and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveys struggle with fixed formats, costs, and biases. AlignSurvey aims to replicate and improve the survey pipeline using LLMs.

Method: AlignSurvey defines four tasks aligned with survey stages and provides evaluation metrics. It uses datasets like the Social Foundation Corpus and SurveyLM models.

Result: The benchmark includes diverse datasets and models, focusing on alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness.

Conclusion: AlignSurvey offers tools for transparent, socially responsible research, addressing gaps in traditional survey methods.

Abstract: Understanding human attitudes, preferences, and behaviors through social surveys is essential for academic research and policymaking. Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment. All datasets, models, and tools are available at github and huggingface to support transparent and socially responsible research.

*Neelesh Kumar Shukla,Pranay Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system forecasts civil unrest events in democracies like India by analyzing news announcements, using topic modeling, word2vec, and NER to identify related entities and standardize dates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting civil unrest events helps officials take preventive action, as protests are often announced in advance for large participation.

Method: The system uses topic modeling and word2vec to filter news articles, NER to identify entities (people, organizations, locations, dates), and time normalization for date standardization. It also introduces Related Entity Extraction to pinpoint entities involved in events.

Result: A geographically independent model was developed to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events and extracting Related Entities.

Conclusion: The paper presents a generalized model for forecasting civil unrest by analyzing news announcements and extracting relevant entities, aiding administrative preparedness.

Abstract: In democracies like India, people are free to express their views and demands. Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format. In this paper, we have developed a geographically independent, generalized model to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events. There could be many mentions of entities, but only a few may actually be involved in the event. This paper calls such entities Related Entities and proposes a method to extract them, referred to as Related Entity Extraction.

### [133] [Breaking the Adversarial Robustness-Performance Trade-off in Text Classification via Manifold Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07888)
*Chenhao Dang,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MC^2F is a system for improving text classification robustness against adversarial attacks without degrading clean data performance, using manifold learning and geodesic purification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of maintaining clean data performance while enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks in text classification.

Method: Proposes MC^2F, which includes a Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) to learn clean data manifold density and a Geodesic Purification Solver to correct adversarial embeddings via shortest path projection.

Result: MC^2F achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness and fully preserves clean data performance, even improving accuracy slightly.

Conclusion: MC^2F effectively resolves the trade-off between robustness and clean data performance in text classification by leveraging manifold-based correction.

Abstract: A persistent challenge in text classification (TC) is that enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks typically degrades performance on clean data. We argue that this challenge can be resolved by modeling the distribution of clean samples in the encoder embedding manifold. To this end, we propose the Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), a two-module system that operates directly on sentence embeddings. A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation. We conducted extensive evaluations on text classification (TC) across three datasets and multiple adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate that our method, MC^2F, not only establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness but also fully preserves performance on clean data, even yielding modest gains in accuracy.

*Songze Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Zhaoyan Gong,Xiaoke Guo,Zhengke Gui,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Logits-to-Logic to improve LLMs' logic consistency in structured reasoning tasks by targeting and correcting LLM outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with logic consistency in structured tasks due to Logic Drift, despite their success in natural language reasoning. Existing methods lack fundamental solutions and flexibility.

Method: The proposed Logits-to-Logic framework includes logits strengthening and filtering to address logical defects in LLM outputs.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement in LLMs' logic consistency and state-of-the-art performance on KGQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Logits-to-Logic effectively enhances LLMs' structured reasoning by correcting logic drift in outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve excellent performance in natural language reasoning tasks through pre-training on vast unstructured text, enabling them to understand the logic in natural language and generate logic-consistent responses. However, the representational differences between unstructured and structured knowledge make LLMs inherently struggle to maintain logic consistency, leading to \textit{Logic Drift} challenges in structured knowledge reasoning tasks such as Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Existing methods address this limitation by designing complex workflows embedded in prompts to guide LLM reasoning. Nevertheless, these approaches only provide input-level guidance and fail to fundamentally address the \textit{Logic Drift} in LLM outputs. Additionally, their inflexible reasoning workflows cannot adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs. To enhance LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning, we specifically target the logits output from the autoregressive generation process. We propose the \textit{Logits-to-Logic} framework, which incorporates logits strengthening and logits filtering as core modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple KGQA benchmarks.

*Nur Shazwani Kamarudin,Ghazaleh Beigi,Lydia Manikonda,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how social media data can be analyzed to address mental health challenges like depression and anxiety, using advanced methodologies like machine learning and NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to leverage social media as a tool for understanding stigmatized mental health issues without compromising anonymity, thereby improving medical practice and policy-making.

Method: The research employs linguistic, visual, and emotional indicators from user disclosures, utilizing machine learning, feature engineering, and NLP techniques.

Result: The findings highlight how social media data can provide insights into mental health, fostering awareness and enabling timely support.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the potential of social media analysis for mental health research and suggests future directions for this emerging field.

Abstract: There is an increasing number of virtual communities and forums available on the web. With social media, people can freely communicate and share their thoughts, ask personal questions, and seek peer-support, especially those with conditions that are highly stigmatized, without revealing personal identity. We study the state-of-the-art research methodologies and findings on mental health challenges like de- pression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, from the pervasive use of social media data. We also discuss how these novel thinking and approaches can help to raise awareness of mental health issues in an unprecedented way. Specifically, this chapter describes linguistic, visual, and emotional indicators expressed in user disclosures. The main goal of this chapter is to show how this new source of data can be tapped to improve medical practice, provide timely support, and influence government or policymakers. In the context of social media for mental health issues, this chapter categorizes social media data used, introduces different deployed machine learning, feature engineering, natural language processing, and surveys methods and outlines directions for future research.

*Jung-Sun Lee,Ha-Na Jo,Eunyeong Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes theta-band neural synchrony across different speech modes (overt, whispered, perceived, imagined) to uncover shared and distinct neural dynamics in language processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in integrated comparisons of theta synchrony across speech modes, revealing neural mechanisms underlying language perception and imagined speech.

Method: Analysis of theta-band neural synchrony using connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations across speech modes.

Result: Overt and whispered speech showed broader frontotemporal synchrony; perceived speech had dominant posterior/temporal patterns; imagined speech exhibited confined frontal/supplementary motor synchrony.

Conclusion: Theta synchrony varies significantly across speech modes, reflecting distinct neural dynamics for articulation, perception, and imagination.

Abstract: Human speech production encompasses multiple modes such as perceived, overt, whispered, and imagined, each reflecting distinct neural mechanisms. Among these, theta-band synchrony has been closely associated with language processing, attentional control, and inner speech. However, previous studies have largely focused on a single mode, such as overt speech, and have rarely conducted an integrated comparison of theta synchrony across different speech modes. In this study, we analyzed differences in theta-band neural synchrony across speech modes based on connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations. The results revealed that overt and whispered speech exhibited broader and stronger frontotemporal synchrony, reflecting active motor-phonological coupling during overt articulation, whereas perceived speech showed dominant posterior and temporal synchrony patterns, consistent with auditory perception and comprehension processes. In contrast, imagined speech demonstrated a more spatially confined but internally coherent synchronization pattern, primarily involving frontal and supplementary motor regions. These findings indicate that the extent and spatial distribution of theta synchrony differ substantially across modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying predominantly on temporoparietal networks. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the differences in theta-band neural synchrony across various speech modes, thereby uncovering both the shared and distinct neural dynamics underlying language perception and imagined speech.

*Matthias De Lange,Jens-Joris Decorte,Jeroen Van Hautte*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WorkBench introduces a unified evaluation suite for work-related NLP tasks, showing significant cross-task transfer and leading to Unified Work Embeddings (UWE), which outperforms generalist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for specialized NLP capabilities in work domains is high, but existing models focus on individual tasks, lacking unified evaluation.

Method: WorkBench evaluates six work-related tasks as ranking problems. UWE, a bi-encoder, uses synthetic data enrichment and a many-to-many InfoNCE objective.

Result: UWE achieves zero-shot ranking on unseen tasks, low-latency inference, and significant gains over generalist models in macro-averaged MAP and RP@10.

Conclusion: UWE provides a task-agnostic solution for work-related NLP, demonstrating superior performance and cross-task transferability.

Abstract: Workforce transformation across diverse industries has driven an increased demand for specialized natural language processing capabilities. Nevertheless, tasks derived from work-related contexts inherently reflect real-world complexities, characterized by long-tailed distributions, extreme multi-label target spaces, and scarce data availability. The rise of generalist embedding models prompts the question of their performance in the work domain, especially as progress in the field has focused mainly on individual tasks. To this end, we introduce WorkBench, the first unified evaluation suite spanning six work-related tasks formulated explicitly as ranking problems, establishing a common ground for multi-task progress. Based on this benchmark, we find significant positive cross-task transfer, and use this insight to compose task-specific bipartite graphs from real-world data, synthetically enriched through grounding. This leads to Unified Work Embeddings (UWE), a task-agnostic bi-encoder that exploits our training-data structure with a many-to-many InfoNCE objective, and leverages token-level embeddings with task-agnostic soft late interaction. UWE demonstrates zero-shot ranking performance on unseen target spaces in the work domain, enables low-latency inference by caching the task target space embeddings, and shows significant gains in macro-averaged MAP and RP@10 over generalist embedding models.

TL;DR: NOTAM-Evolve is a self-evolving framework using LLMs and knowledge graphs to improve NOTAM interpretation, achieving a 30.4% accuracy boost over base LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate NOTAM interpretation is vital for aviation safety, but current automated systems lack depth in parsing actionable intelligence.

Method: Proposes NOTAM-Evolve, combining dynamic knowledge grounding and schema-based inference with a closed-loop learning process for LLMs.

Result: Achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over base LLM, setting a new benchmark with 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs.

Conclusion: NOTAM-Evolve significantly advances structured NOTAM interpretation, reducing reliance on human annotations.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) is critical for aviation safety, yet their condensed and cryptic language poses significant challenges to both manual and automated processing. Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.

*Taja Kuzman Pungeršek,Peter Rupnik,Ivan Porupski,Vuk Dinić,Nikola Ljubešić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show strong zero-shot performance in South Slavic text classification, often matching fine-tuned BERT models, but have drawbacks like unpredictability and higher costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore LLM performance on text classification in less-resourced South Slavic languages compared to fine-tuned BERT models.

Method: Evaluate openly available BERT-like models and LLMs on tasks: sentiment, topic, and genre classification across three domains using zero-shot setups.

Result: LLMs match or surpass BERT models in zero-shot performance but suffer from unpredictability, slower inference, and higher costs.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned BERT models remain more practical for large-scale text annotation despite LLMs' strong zero-shot capabilities.

Abstract: Until recently, fine-tuned BERT-like models provided state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks. With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-correction distillation (SCD) method to enhance small-scale LLMs' structured data QA performance by detecting errors and leveraging large-scale LLMs' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small-scale LLMs struggle with generating structured queries in QA tasks, necessitating improved methods for better performance and generalization.

Method: Proposes SCD with an error prompt mechanism (EPM) for error detection and customized feedback, and a two-stage distillation strategy to transfer capabilities from large-scale LLMs.

Result: SCD outperforms other distillation methods on small-scale LLMs (8B) and approaches GPT4's performance on some datasets. Large-scale LLMs with EPM achieve state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SCD effectively enhances small-scale LLMs' QA abilities and generalizes well, while EPM boosts large-scale LLMs' performance.

Abstract: Structured data question answering (QA), including table QA, Knowledge Graph (KG) QA, and temporal KG QA, is a pivotal research area. Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets. Furthermore, large-scale LLMs equipped with EPM surpass the state-of-the-art results on most datasets.

Method: Proposes HyCoRA with Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation: a hyper-network generates role-specific modules, while a trainable role-shared module captures common traits. Includes hyper-contrastive learning.

Result: Superior performance on English and Chinese benchmarks, validated by GPT-4 evaluations and visual analyses.

Conclusion: HyCoRA effectively balances distinct and shared traits, improving multi-character role-playing.

Abstract: Multi-character role-playing aims to equip models with the capability to simulate diverse roles. Existing methods either use one shared parameterized module across all roles or assign a separate parameterized module to each role. However, the role-shared module may ignore distinct traits of each role, weakening personality learning, while the role-specific module may overlook shared traits across multiple roles, hindering commonality modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel HyCoRA: Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive learning framework, which efficiently improves multi-character role-playing ability by balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. Specifically, we propose a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, where one half is a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network, and the other half is a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module is devised to represent distinct persona signatures, while the role-shared module serves to capture common traits. Moreover, to better reflect distinct personalities across different roles, we design a hyper-contrastive learning mechanism to help the hyper-network distinguish their unique characteristics. Extensive experimental results on both English and Chinese available benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Further GPT-4 evaluations and visual analyses also verify the capability of HyCoRA to capture role characteristics.

*Abdullah Muhammad Moosa,Nusrat Sultana,Mahdi Muhammad Moosa,Md. Miraiz Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BARD10, a Bangla authorship dataset, and evaluates stop-word removal's impact across models, finding SVM outperforms Bangla BERT. Stop-words are crucial stylistic indicators in Bangla.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in Bangla authorship attribution by introducing a balanced corpus (BARD10) and analyzing stylistic significance of stop-words across classical and deep learning models.

Method: Utilized BARD10 and BAAD16 datasets, evaluating SVM, Bangla BERT, XGBoost, and MLP classifiers with uniform preprocessing. Focused on stop-word removal effects.

Result: TF-IDF + SVM outperformed, scoring 0.997 macro-F1 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10. Bangla BERT lagged by five points. Stop-word pruning significantly impacts BARD10 authors.

Conclusion: Bangla stop-words are vital stylistic markers. Fine-tuned ML models excel in short-text tasks. BARD10 bridges literature and web dialogue, providing a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: This research presents a comprehensive investigation into Bangla authorship attribution, introducing a new balanced benchmark corpus BARD10 (Bangla Authorship Recognition Dataset of 10 authors) and systematically analyzing the impact of stop-word removal across classical and deep learning models to uncover the stylistic significance of Bangla stop-words. BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models. Three insights are identified: Bangla stop-words serve as essential stylistic indicators; finely calibrated ML models prove effective within short-text limitations; and BARD10 connects formal literature with contemporary web dialogue, offering a reproducible benchmark for future long-context or domain-adapted transformers.

### [143] [Estranged Predictions: Measuring Semantic Category Disruption with Masked Language Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08109)
*Yuxuan Liu,Haim Dubossarsky,Ruth Ahnert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses masked language modeling (MLM) to analyze how science fiction disrupts ontological categories (human, animal, machine) compared to general fiction, revealing heightened conceptual permeability in sci-fi, especially for machine terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to operationalize Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement computationally, measuring how science fiction destabilizes ontological categories compared to general fiction.

Method: The authors use RoBERTa for masked language modeling and Gemini to classify lexical substitutes, analyzing corpora from science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM) through metrics like retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy.

Result: Science fiction shows higher conceptual permeability, especially for machine referents, which exhibit cross-category substitution. Human terms remain semantically coherent, anchoring hierarchies. This suggests genre-specific restructuring of anthropocentric logics.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates estrangement in science fiction as a perturbation of semantic norms, detectable via MLMs, and contributes to computational literary studies by revealing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions.

Abstract: This paper examines how science fiction destabilises ontological categories by measuring conceptual permeability across the terms human, animal, and machine using masked language modelling (MLM). Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions. This study contributes to the methodological repertoire of computational literary studies and offers new insights into the linguistic infrastructure of science fiction.

### [144] [Multimodal LLMs Do Not Compose Skills Optimally Across Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08113)
*Paula Ontalvilla,Aitor Ormazabal,Gorka Azkune*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) combine skills across modalities, revealing a significant skill composition gap and exploring mitigation strategies like chain-of-thought prompting and fine-tuning, which show limited success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the ability of MLLMs to compose skills across modalities, as their pretraining complexity grows.

Method: Three evaluation tasks requiring sequential skill composition were designed, testing models under direct prompting and cascaded inference. Mitigation strategies included chain-of-thought prompting and fine-tuning.

Result: All evaluated MLLMs showed a notable skill composition gap. Mitigation strategies improved performance but gaps persisted.

Conclusion: More research is needed to enhance cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs, as current methods are insufficient.

Abstract: Skill composition is the ability to combine previously learned skills to solve new tasks. As neural networks acquire increasingly complex skills during their pretraining, it is not clear how successfully they can compose them. In this paper, we focus on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), and study their ability to compose skills across modalities. To this end, we design three evaluation tasks which can be solved sequentially composing two modality-dependent skills, and evaluate several open MLLMs under two main settings: i) prompting the model to directly solve the task, and ii) using a two-step cascaded inference approach, which manually enforces the composition of the two skills for a given task. Even with these straightforward compositions, we find that all evaluated MLLMs exhibit a significant cross-modality skill composition gap. To mitigate the aforementioned gap, we explore two alternatives: i) use chain-of-thought prompting to explicitly instruct MLLMs for skill composition and ii) a specific fine-tuning recipe to promote skill composition. Although those strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit significant skill composition gaps, suggesting that more research is needed to improve cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates why quantification is challenging for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by comparing human quantification features (scales, ranges, biases) with MLLMs' performance across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantification's difficulty for MLLMs remains unclear due to its intersection with logic, pragmatics, and numerical domains. The study aims to uncover differences between human and MLLM quantification.

Method: Examines three unexplored human quantification features (scales, ranges, biases) in MLLMs, analyzing their encoding and performance across tasks and languages.

Result: Clear differences exist between humans and MLLMs in quantification features, highlighting discrepancies in semantic and pragmatic processing.

Conclusion: The findings advance understanding of MLLMs as semantic agents and their robustness across languages, guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Quantification has been proven to be a particularly difficult linguistic phenomenon for (Multimodal) Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, given that quantification interfaces with the logic, pragmatic, and numerical domains, the exact reasons for the poor performance are still unclear. This papers looks at three key features of human quantification shared cross-linguistically that have remained so far unexplored in the (M)LLM literature: the ordering of quantifiers into scales, the ranges of use and prototypicality, and the biases inherent in the human approximate number system. The aim is to determine how these features are encoded in the models' architecture, how they may differ from humans, and whether the results are affected by the type of model and language under investigation. We find that there are clear differences between humans and MLLMs with respect to these features across various tasks that tap into the representation of quantification in vivo vs. in silico. This work, thus, paves the way for addressing the nature of MLLMs as semantic and pragmatic agents, while the cross-linguistic lens can elucidate whether their abilities are robust and stable across different languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high memory and computational demands of processing long sequences in LLMs.

Method: Fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to use learned compression tokens for context compression.

Result: Achieves 2x-8x compression without significant performance drop, matching alternatives while offering higher ratios.

Conclusion: Learned compression tokens enable efficient LLM processing with minimal trade-offs.

Abstract: This work investigates context compression for Large Language Models (LLMs) using learned compression tokens to reduce the memory and computational demands of processing long sequences. We demonstrate that pre-trained LLMs can be fine-tuned to compress their context by factors of 2x to 8x without significant performance degradation, as evaluated on both short-context and long-context benchmarks. Furthermore, in experiments on a 3-billion-parameter LLaMA model, our method achieves results on par with alternative compression techniques while attaining higher compression ratios.

*Kushal Tatariya,Wessel Poelman,Miryam de Lhoneux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether language model architectures biased towards English degrade performance for structurally different languages, focusing on positional encodings and the trade-off between morphological complexity and word order flexibility. No clear interaction was found.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if architectural bias in language models (initially designed for English) affects performance for languages structurally different from English, using positional encodings as a case study.

Method: Pretrained monolingual models with absolute, relative, and no positional encodings for seven diverse languages, evaluated on four downstream tasks.

Result: No clear interaction observed between positional encodings and morphological complexity or word order flexibility. Task, language, and metric choices are crucial for stable conclusions.

Conclusion: Architectural bias assumptions may not hold universally; task and language diversity are key for reliable findings.

Abstract: Language model architectures are predominantly first created for English and subsequently applied to other languages. It is an open question whether this architectural bias leads to degraded performance for languages that are structurally different from English. We examine one specific architectural choice: positional encodings, through the lens of the trade-off hypothesis: the supposed interplay between morphological complexity and word order flexibility. This hypothesis posits a trade-off between the two: a more morphologically complex language can have a more flexible word order, and vice-versa. Positional encodings are a direct target to investigate the implications of this hypothesis in relation to language modelling. We pretrain monolingual model variants with absolute, relative, and no positional encodings for seven typologically diverse languages and evaluate them on four downstream tasks. Contrary to previous findings, we do not observe a clear interaction between position encodings and morphological complexity or word order flexibility, as measured by various proxies. Our results show that the choice of tasks, languages, and metrics are essential for drawing stable conclusions

*Qiankun Pi,Yepeng Sun,Jicang Lu,Qinlong Fan,Ningbo Huang,Shiyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RelPrior, a new paradigm using relation as a prior to improve LLM-based Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) by filtering noise and avoiding misjudgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance gaps in LLM-based DocRE caused by noise from unrelated entity pairs and misjudgment due to strict predefined relations.

Method: RelPrior paradigm uses binary relation as a prior to filter irrelevant entity pairs and predefined relations to match entities for triples extraction.

Result: RelPrior outperforms existing LLM-based methods on two benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RelPrior effectively enhances LLM-based DocRE by reducing noise and misjudgment, demonstrating superior results.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in document understanding. However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted "extract entities then predict relations" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLM-based methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs versus specialized models for Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion, finding specialized models outperform LLMs, though LLMs offer alternatives when domain-specific data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can surpass specialized models in handling complex tasks in low-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sanskrit.

Method: Compared instruction-tuned and prompted LLMs with a fine-tuned ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model on Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion.

Result: ByT5-Sanskrit outperformed LLMs, validated by human evaluation. Prompting LLMs was useful without domain-specific data.

Conclusion: Specialized models excel in complex language tasks, but LLMs provide viable alternatives when data is limited.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly treated as universal, general-purpose solutions across NLP tasks, particularly in English. But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores. Additionally, our prompting strategies provide an alternative to fine-tuning when domain-specific verse corpora are unavailable, and the task-specific Seq2Seq model demonstrates robust generalisation on out-of-domain evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes the BabyLM corpus and CHILDES age-groups, finding limited syntactic differentiation by age but highlighting the utility of syntactic knowledge for interpreting model performance. Curriculum learning approaches, especially using syntactically categorizable data, improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand syntactic properties in child language data (BabyLM corpus and CHILDES) and explore how syntactic knowledge aids model performance interpretation.

Method: Examined syntactic differentiation by age in CHILDES and tested various curriculum learning approaches, including developmental and cognitively inspired methods.

Result: CHILDES lacks strong syntactic differentiation by age, but syntactic knowledge aids model performance. Syntactically categorizable data subsets outperform full noisy corpora.

Conclusion: Syntactic knowledge enhances model performance interpretation, and focused curricula using categorizable data yield better results than noisy full datasets.

Abstract: We examine the syntactic properties of BabyLM corpus, and age-groups within CHILDES. While we find that CHILDES does not exhibit strong syntactic differentiation by age, we show that the syntactic knowledge about the training data can be helpful in interpreting model performance on linguistic tasks. For curriculum learning, we explore developmental and several alternative cognitively inspired curriculum approaches. We find that some curricula help with reading tasks, but the main performance improvement come from using the subset of syntactically categorizable data, rather than the full noisy corpus.

Conclusion: The proposed encoder-based system is effective for extracting knowledge from astronomy articles.

Abstract: Scientific literature in astronomy is rapidly expanding, making it increasingly important to automate the extraction of key entities and contextual information from research papers. In this paper, we present an encoder-based system for extracting knowledge from astronomy articles. Our objective is to develop models capable of classifying telescope references, detecting auxiliary semantic attributes, and recognizing instrument mentions from textual content. To this end, we implement a multi-task transformer-based system built upon the SciBERT model and fine-tuned for astronomy corpora classification. To carry out the fine-tuning, we stochastically sample segments from the training data and use majority voting over the test segments at inference time. Our system, despite its simplicity and low-cost implementation, significantly outperforms the open-weight GPT baseline.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an embedding-based framework to detect gender bias in LLMs for formative feedback, revealing asymmetric responses to gendered cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for benchmarking LLMs in educational contexts, particularly for detecting biases in formative feedback.

Method: Used 600 student essays and constructed counterfactuals with gendered terms and author backgrounds. Evaluated six LLMs using embedding distances, permutation tests, and visualization.

Result: Implicit gendered terms caused larger semantic shifts in male-female swaps. Only GPT and Llama models were sensitive to explicit gender cues, revealing bias.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit gender bias in feedback. The study suggests fairness auditing standards and practical guidance for equitable feedback.

Abstract: As teachers increasingly turn to GenAI in their educational practice, we need robust methods to benchmark large language models (LLMs) for pedagogical purposes. This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.

Conclusion: VocalBench-zh fills a critical gap, aiding developers and users in assessing Mandarin speech interactive systems.

Abstract: The development of multi-modal large language models (LLMs) leads to intelligent approaches capable of speech interactions. As one of the most widely spoken languages globally, Mandarin is supported by most models to enhance their applicability and reach. However, the scarcity of comprehensive speech-to-speech (S2S) benchmarks in Mandarin contexts impedes systematic evaluation for developers and hinders fair model comparison for users. In this work, we propose VocalBench-zh, an ability-level divided evaluation suite adapted to Mandarin context consisting of 10 well-crafted subsets and over 10K high-quality instances, covering 12 user-oriented characters. The evaluation experiment on 14 mainstream models reveals the common challenges for current routes, and highlights the need for new insights into next-generation speech interactive systems.

Conclusion: The framework has strong potential to revolutionize data access and handling in data-driven environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces an Error Correction through Prompt Tuning for NL-to-SQL, leveraging the latest advancements in generative pre-training-based LLMs and RAG. Our work addresses the crucial need for efficient and accurate translation of natural language queries into SQL expressions in various settings with the growing use of natural language interfaces. We explore the evolution of NLIDBs from early rule-based systems to advanced neural network-driven approaches. Drawing inspiration from the medical diagnostic process, we propose a novel framework integrating an error correction mechanism that diagnoses error types, identifies their causes, provides fixing instructions, and applies these corrections to SQL queries. This approach is further enriched by embedding fine-tuning and RAG, which harnesses external knowledge bases for improved accuracy and transparency. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework achieves a significant 12 percent accuracy improvement over existing baselines, highlighting its potential to revolutionize data access and handling in contemporary data-driven environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and standard evaluation methods ignore political authenticity and ideological consistency.

Method: Constructed a dataset of UK Parliament speeches, introduced an evaluation framework with computational and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, and fine-tuned five LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed significant improvements across metrics; novel embedding-based metrics effectively measured political dimensions.

Conclusion: ParliaBench successfully addresses parliamentary speech generation challenges, demonstrating the value of specialized benchmarks and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Parliamentary speech generation presents specific challenges for large language models beyond standard text generation tasks. Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models. Results show that fine-tuning produces statistically significant improvements across the majority of metrics and our novel metrics demonstrate strong discriminative power for political dimensions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLLMs' ability to understand complex table structures, which is crucial for processing scientific articles.

Method: Utilizes prompt engineering strategies and evaluates multiple VLLMs on CHiTab, comparing their performance with humans.

Result: Generic VLLMs can interpret table structures, highlighting their potential and limitations.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for integrating structured data understanding into general-purpose VLLMs.

Abstract: This work investigates the ability of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) to understand and interpret the structure of tables in scientific articles. Specifically, we explore whether VLLMs can infer the hierarchical structure of tables without additional processing. As a basis for our experiments we use the PubTables-1M dataset, a large-scale corpus of scientific tables. From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task. This study provides insights into the potential and limitations of VLLMs to process complex tables and offers guidance for future work on integrating structured data understanding into general-purpose VLLMs.

Conclusion: Modeling detailed reviewer-author debate structures enhances review decisions, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing paper review methods often rely on superficial manuscript features or directly on large language models (LLMs), which are prone to hallucinations, biased scoring, and limited reasoning capabilities. Moreover, these methods often fail to capture the complex argumentative reasoning and negotiation dynamics inherent in reviewer-author interactions. To address these limitations, we propose ReViewGraph (Reviewer-Author Debates Graph Reasoner), a novel framework that performs heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated multi-round reviewer-author debates. In our approach, reviewer-author exchanges are simulated through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Diverse opinion relations (e.g., acceptance, rejection, clarification, and compromise) are then explicitly extracted and encoded as typed edges within a heterogeneous interaction graph. By applying graph neural networks to reason over these structured debate graphs, ReViewGraph captures fine-grained argumentative dynamics and enables more informed review decisions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ReViewGraph outperforms strong baselines with an average relative improvement of 15.73%, underscoring the value of modeling detailed reviewer-author debate structures.

### [158] [Adaptive Multi-Agent Response Refinement in Conversational Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08319)
*Soyeong Jeong,Aparna Elangovan,Emine Yilmaz,Oleg Rokhlenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent framework to refine LLM responses by focusing on factuality, personalization, and coherence, outperforming baselines in conversational tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often lack personalization and specific knowledge refinement, making pre-delivery response improvement crucial.

Method: A multi-agent system dynamically refines responses by assigning roles (factuality, personalization, coherence) and using adaptive communication.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines, especially in knowledge- and persona-driven conversational tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic multi-agent refinement improves LLM response quality by addressing key conversational aspects.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in conversational systems by generating human-like responses. However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes AgentPRM, a process reward model for LLM agents, improving decision-making efficiency and robustness in multi-turn tasks like web shopping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with multi-turn decision-making tasks like web shopping, requiring intelligent sequential decisions based on feedback. Existing methods rely on prompt engineering or expert trajectory fine-tuning, which are limited.

Method: Introduces AgentPRM, a re-defined process reward model capturing decision interdependence and goal contribution. Uses TD-based estimation with GAE for scalable labeled data training.

Result: AgentPRM is 8× more compute-efficient than baselines and robustly improves with scaled test-time compute. Detailed analyses highlight its effectiveness, including applications in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: AgentPRM significantly enhances LLM agents' decision-making efficiency and robustness in multi-turn tasks, offering scalable and practical improvements.

Abstract: Despite rapid development, large language models (LLMs) still encounter challenges in multi-turn decision-making tasks (i.e., agent tasks) like web shopping and browser navigation, which require making a sequence of intelligent decisions based on environmental feedback. Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.

*Xinyi Wang,Yiping Song,Zhiliang Tian,Bo Liu,Tingjin Luo,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPRM trains dual implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks, addressing structural and consistency constraints without explicit annotations, yielding significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit PRMs lack adaptability to KG structures and consistency between CoT and KG paths in MHQA tasks.

Method: Proposes DPRM with KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, using reward parameterization and consistency constraints to optimize reasoning paths.

Result: Outperforms 13 baselines with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1.

Conclusion: DPRM effectively handles KG constraints and consistency issues, enhancing multi-step reasoning in MHQA.

Abstract: In multi-hop question answering (MHQA) tasks, Chain of Thought (CoT) improves the quality of generation by guiding large language models (LLMs) through multi-step reasoning, and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) reduce hallucinations via semantic matching. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards. Experimental results show that our method outperforms 13 baselines on multiple datasets with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1.

TL;DR: PCRLLM enhances LLMs' logical coherence by enforcing single-step inferences with verifiable premises, rules, and conclusions, enabling trustworthy and collaborative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack explicit logical coherence, relying on unstructured reasoning, which raises trustworthiness concerns.

Method: PCRLLM constrains reasoning to single-step inferences, specifying premises, rules, and conclusions for verification.

Result: The framework supports chain-level validation and multi-LLM collaboration under formal rules.

Conclusion: PCRLLM introduces a systematic approach to improve LLM reasoning, combining natural language with formal rigor.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit limited logical coherence, mapping premises to conclusions without adherence to explicit inference rules. We propose Proof-Carrying Reasoning with LLMs (PCRLLM), a framework that constrains reasoning to single-step inferences while preserving natural language formulations. Each output explicitly specifies premises, rules, and conclusions, thereby enabling verification against a target logic. This mechanism mitigates trustworthiness concerns by supporting chain-level validation even in black-box settings. Moreover, PCRLLM facilitates systematic multi-LLM collaboration, allowing intermediate steps to be compared and integrated under formal rules. Finally, we introduce a benchmark schema for generating large-scale step-level reasoning data, combining natural language expressiveness with formal rigor.

### [164] [Interaction Dynamics as a Reward Signal for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08394)
*Sian Gooding,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE introduces a novel reward signal based on dialogue dynamics ('conversational geometry') for LLM alignment, achieving competitive accuracy and demonstrating complementary benefits with textual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods focus on textual content, ignoring interaction dynamics, which this paper aims to leverage for improved alignment and privacy preservation.

Method: TRACE uses geometric properties of dialogue embedding trajectories ('conversational geometry') as a reward signal, tested alongside textual analysis.

Result: TRACE achieves 68.20% pairwise accuracy, comparable to a full-text LLM baseline (70.04%). A hybrid model combining both signals reaches 80.17%.

Conclusion: Interaction dynamics are as predictive as textual content for LLM alignment, offering a privacy-preserving diagnostic tool for successful collaboration.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversations typically relies on reward signals derived from the content of the text. This approach, however, overlooks a rich, complementary source of signal: the dynamics of the interaction itself. This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature. This work provides strong evidence that for interactive settings, how an agent communicates is as powerful a predictor of success as what it says, offering a new, privacy-preserving framework that not only aligns agents but also serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding the distinct interaction patterns that drive successful collaboration.

TL;DR: Existing social bot detectors struggle with robustness due to shortcut learning and misleading cues. The study evaluates detector performance under shortcut scenarios and proposes LLM-based mitigation strategies, improving accuracy by 56%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited robustness of social bot detectors in real-world scenarios, especially due to shortcut learning and spurious correlations in textual features.

Method: Design shortcut scenarios with spurious associations between labels and textual cues. Evaluate detector robustness and propose mitigation strategies using counterfactual data augmentation via large language models.

Result: Baseline detectors' accuracy drops by 32% under shortcut scenarios. Proposed strategies improve performance by 56%.

Conclusion: Shortcut learning significantly degrades detector robustness. Mitigation strategies leveraging LLMs effectively address the issue from data and model perspectives.

Abstract: While existing social bot detectors perform well on benchmarks, their robustness across diverse real-world scenarios remains limited due to unclear ground truth and varied misleading cues. In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information. Our strategies achieve an average relative performance improvement of 56\% under shortcut scenarios.

Result: 91.2% general capability retention (vs. 69.7% standard), 94% domain adaptation gains, 90% compute cost reduction.

Conclusion: SPEAR-MM effectively balances domain adaptation and general capability retention, offering interpretable trade-offs and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) adapted to financial domains often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of general reasoning capabilities essential for customer interactions and complex financial analysis. We introduce Selective Parameter Evaluation and Restoration via Model Merging (SPEAR-MM), a practical framework that preserves critical capabilities while enabling domain adaptation. Our method approximates layer-wise impact on external benchmarks through post-hoc analysis, then selectively freezes or restores transformer layers via spherical interpolation merging. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B for financial tasks, SPEAR-MM achieves 91.2% retention of general capabilities versus 69.7% for standard continual pretraining, while maintaining 94% of domain adaptation gains.

TL;DR: S-RAG addresses aggregative queries by structuring corpus data and translating natural-language queries into formal ones, outperforming traditional RAG systems and long-context LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems fall short in handling aggregative queries that require gathering and reasoning over large sets of documents.

Method: S-RAG constructs a structured corpus representation and translates queries into formal ones for retrieval and reasoning.

Result: S-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG systems and long-context LLMs on new datasets (HOTELS, WORLD CUP) and a public benchmark.

Conclusion: S-RAG effectively handles aggregative queries, demonstrating superior performance and paving the way for further research.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the dominant approach for answering questions over large corpora. However, current datasets and methods are highly focused on cases where only a small part of the corpus (usually a few paragraphs) is relevant per query, and fail to capture the rich world of aggregative queries. These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries. At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation. To validate our approach and promote further research in this area, we introduce two new datasets of aggregative queries: HOTELS and WORLD CUP. Experiments with S-RAG on the newly introduced datasets, as well as on a public benchmark, demonstrate that it substantially outperforms both common RAG systems and long-context LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large-scale datasets for sentence-level BdSL translation, which limits research to word/alphabet-level tasks.

Method: Created Bangla-SGP dataset (1,000 human-annotated + 3,000 synthetic pairs) using a rule-based RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned models (mBart50, mT5, GPT4.1-nano) and evaluated with BLEU scores.

Result: Evaluation shows model performance on gloss-translation consistency against Bangla-SGP and RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmarks.

Conclusion: The dataset and pipeline enable sentence-level BdSL translation, with transformer models showing promising results.

Abstract: Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) translation represents a low-resource NLP task due to the lack of large-scale datasets that address sentence-level translation. Correspondingly, existing research in this field has been limited to word and alphabet level detection. In this work, we introduce Bangla-SGP, a novel parallel dataset consisting of 1,000 human-annotated sentence-gloss pairs which was augmented with around 3,000 synthetically generated pairs using syntactic and morphological rules through a rule-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in complex but easy-to-verify problems, yet they still struggle with discovering the unknown. In this paper, we present \textbf{AlphaResearch}, an autonomous research agent designed to discover new algorithms on open-ended problems. To synergize the feasibility and innovation of the discovery process, we construct a novel dual research environment by combining the execution-based verify and simulated real-world peer review environment.

To promote a transparent evaluation process, we construct \textbf{AlphaResearchComp}, a new evaluation benchmark that includes an eight open-ended algorithmic problems competition, with each problem carefully curated and verified through executable pipelines, objective metrics, and reproducibility checks. AlphaResearch gets a 2/8 win rate in head-to-head comparison with human researchers, demonstrate the possibility of accelerating algorithm discovery with LLMs. Notably, the algorithm discovered by AlphaResearch on the \emph{``packing circles''} problem achieves the best-of-known performance, surpassing the results of human researchers and strong baselines from recent work (e.g., AlphaEvolve). Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the remaining challenges of the 6/8 failure cases, providing valuable insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the potential misuse of LRMs by monitoring their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces for signs of misbehavior (e.g., shortcuts or sycophancy), despite challenges like unfaithful verbalization and monitor reliability.

Method: The study is structured around verbalization quality and monitor reliability, analyzing empirical evidence and correlations across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. It also evaluates CoT intervention methods and proposes MoME for structured monitoring.

Result: Findings highlight challenges in CoT faithfulness and monitor sensitivity. The paper provides insights into how CoT interventions affect monitoring and introduces MoME as a potential solution.

Conclusion: CoT Monitorability offers promise for AI safety but requires addressing key challenges. MoME represents a step forward in structured, evidence-based monitoring of LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers. Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.

Abstract: This report presents a detailed methodology for constructing a high-quality Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) dataset from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus and adapting it for Opinion Role Labeling (ORL) tasks. Leveraging the PropBank annotation framework, we implement a reproducible extraction pipeline that aligns predicate-argument structures with surface text, converts syntactic tree pointers to coherent spans, and applies rigorous cleaning to ensure semantic fidelity.

We provide a detailed account of our extraction algorithms, discontinuous argument handling, annotation corrections, and statistical analysis of the resulting dataset. This work offers a reusable resource for researchers aiming to leverage SRL for enhancing ORL, especially in low-resource opinion mining scenarios.

*Davi Bastos Costa,Felippe Alves,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs express and shift moral judgments under persona role-play, using a benchmark to measure moral robustness and susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs behave morally in social contexts, especially when assuming specific personas, is crucial for their responsible deployment.

Method: The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) is used to benchmark moral susceptibility (variability across personas) and robustness (variability within personas).

Result: Model family strongly influences robustness, with Claude being the most robust. Size affects susceptibility, with larger models more susceptible. Robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how personas shape LLMs' moral behavior, highlighting variations across model families and sizes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in social contexts, motivating analysis of how they express and shift moral judgments. In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models. Together, these analyses provide a systematic view of how persona conditioning shapes moral behavior in large language models.

Motivation: Addresses the latent overthinking phenomenon in recurrent transformers, where easy tokens are erroneously revised, by focusing iterations on hard tokens.

Method: Uses a lightweight neural decider to identify hard tokens, employs LoRA modules for refinement, and introduces duo-causal attention for cross-iteration flow.

Result: Boosts accuracy by 8.1-12.6% across benchmarks, exempting 94% of tokens from extra iterations, and maintains parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: TaH effectively enhances LLM reasoning performance dynamically while preserving parameter constraints.

Abstract: Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

### [174] [Training Language Models to Explain Their Own Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08579)
*Belinda Z. Li,Zifan Carl Guo,Vincent Huang,Jacob Steinhardt,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMs can learn to describe their internal computations faithfully, and self-explanation works better than cross-model explanation, offering scalable interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore if LMs can leverage their internal access to produce faithful explanations of their behavior, complementing existing interpretability methods.

Method: Fine-tune LMs using ground truth from interpretability techniques to generate descriptions of encoded information, causal structures, and token influences.

Result: Explainer models generalize well with minimal training, and self-explanation outperforms cross-model explanation.

Conclusion: LMs can reliably explain their internal computations, providing a scalable complement to interpretability techniques.

Abstract: Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

### [177] [Towards Personalized Quantum Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07471)
*Ratun Rahman,Sina Shaham,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PQFL, a personalized quantum federated learning framework for anomaly detection, addressing heterogeneity in quantum clients and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection faces challenges due to context-dependent anomalies and limited labeled data. Quantum federated learning (QFL) helps but struggles with client heterogeneity.

Method: PQFL uses parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers for local model training, adapting models to each client's hardware and data.

Result: PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23% and improves AUROC by 24.2% and AUPR by 20.5% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PQFL effectively addresses client heterogeneity in quantum federated settings, enhancing anomaly detection accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has a significant impact on applications such as video surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial monitoring, where anomalies frequently depend on context and anomaly-labeled data are limited. Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MVAE introduces a VAE variant with full-covariance posteriors, improving reconstruction, calibration, and unsupervised structure over diagonal VAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of diagonal posterior restrictions in VAEs by introducing a tractable full-covariance framework.

Method: MVAE factorizes posterior covariance using a global coupling matrix and per-sample diagonal scales, enabling efficient reparameterization.

Result: MVAE outperforms diagonal VAEs in reconstruction, calibration, and unsupervised structure, particularly at mid-range latent sizes.

Conclusion: MVAE provides a scalable and effective solution for VAEs with full-covariance posteriors, offering improved performance and interpretability.

Abstract: We present the Multivariate Variational Autoencoder (MVAE), a VAE variant that preserves Gaussian tractability while lifting the diagonal posterior restriction. MVAE factorizes each posterior covariance, where a \emph{global} coupling matrix $\mathbf{C}$ induces dataset-wide latent correlations and \emph{per-sample} diagonal scales modulate local uncertainty. This yields a full-covariance family with analytic KL and an efficient reparameterization via $\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{C}\mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbolσ)$. Across Larochelle-style MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, MVAE consistently matches or improves reconstruction (MSE~$\downarrow$) and delivers robust gains in calibration (NLL/Brier/ECE~$\downarrow$) and unsupervised structure (NMI/ARI~$\uparrow$) relative to diagonal-covariance VAEs with matched capacity, especially at mid-range latent sizes. Latent-plane visualizations further indicate smoother, more coherent factor traversals and sharper local detail. We release a fully reproducible implementation with training/evaluation scripts and sweep utilities to facilitate fair comparison and reuse.

*Yang Yang,Kathryn Pollak,Bibhas Chakraborty,Molei Liu,Doudou Zhou,Chuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RELEAP, a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework, improves EHR phenotyping by using prediction performance feedback to guide label correction and sample selection, outperforming baselines in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR phenotyping often uses noisy proxy labels, undermining risk prediction reliability, while traditional active learning lacks feedback-driven phenotype refinement.

Method: RELEAP integrates multiple querying strategies and updates policies based on downstream model feedback, evaluated on DUHS data for lung cancer risk prediction.

Result: RELEAP outperformed baselines with logistic AUC rising from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752, showing smoother gains under the same labeling budget.

Conclusion: RELEAP offers a scalable, label-efficient solution linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, enhancing EHR-based risk prediction reliability.

Abstract: Objective: Electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping often relies on noisy proxy labels, which undermine the reliability of downstream risk prediction. Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but most rely on fixed heuristics and do not ensure that phenotype refinement improves prediction performance. Our goal was to develop a framework that directly uses downstream prediction performance as feedback to guide phenotype correction and sample selection under constrained labeling budgets.
  Materials and Methods: We propose Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping (RELEAP), a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework. RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and, unlike prior methods, updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. We evaluated RELEAP on a de-identified Duke University Health System (DUHS) cohort (2014-2024) for incident lung cancer risk prediction, using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models. Performance was benchmarked against noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning.
  Results: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines. Logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Using downstream performance as feedback, RELEAP produced smoother and more stable gains than heuristic methods under the same labeling budget.
  Discussion: By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples most improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled alternative to fixed active learning rules.
  Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction.

*Reem Al-Saidi,Erman Ayday,Ziad Kobti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how fine-tuning LLMs affects vulnerability to embedding reconstruction attacks on genomic sequences, finding that fine-tuning enhances privacy protections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding how fine-tuning impacts privacy risks in LLMs applied to genomic data, building on prior research about embedding leakage.

Method: Used the HS3D dataset, applied Pan et al.'s attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings, implemented DNA-specific tokenization, and analyzed vulnerabilities across embedding types.

Result: Fine-tuning improved resistance to attacks: XLNet (+19.8%), GPT-2 (+9.8%), and BERT (+7.8%), suggesting task-specific optimization enhances privacy.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning may strengthen privacy protections in LLMs for genomic data, warranting further research into advanced safeguards and privacy-enhancing techniques.

Abstract: This study investigates embedding reconstruction attacks in large language models (LLMs) applied to genomic sequences, with a specific focus on how fine-tuning affects vulnerability to these attacks. Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\%), and BERT (+7.8\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism. These results highlight the need for advanced protective mechanisms for language models processing sensitive genomic data, while highlighting fine-tuning as a potential privacy-enhancing technique worth further exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AAPP introduces a dynamic pruning method to preserve safety-critical circuits in LLMs, improving refusal rates by 50% without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face deployment challenges due to high computational demands and alignment degradation from dynamic pruning.

Method: Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP) dynamically preserves alignment-relevant circuits during inference, enhancing safety.

Result: Experiments on models like LLaMA 2-7B show AAPP improves refusal rates by 50% at matched compute.

Conclusion: AAPP enables efficient, safety-preserving LLM deployment by addressing alignment vulnerabilities dynamically.

Abstract: Large Language Models require substantial computational resources for inference, posing deployment challenges. While dynamic pruning offers superior efficiency over static methods through adaptive circuit selection, it exacerbates alignment degradation by retaining only input-dependent safety-critical circuit preservation across diverse inputs. As a result, addressing these heightened alignment vulnerabilities remains critical. We introduce Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP), a dynamic structured pruning method that adaptively preserves alignment-relevant circuits during inference, building upon Probe Pruning. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12B-IT show AAPP improves refusal rates by 50\% at matched compute, enabling efficient yet safety-preserving LLM deployment.

*Sushant Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework unifying diverse ML biases (e.g., unfairness, brittleness, poor performance) under conditional independence violations. It proves equivalence conditions and validates predictions empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge isolated studies on ML biases (fairness, robustness, distribution shifts) by offering a common theoretical perspective.

Method: Formalizes biases via information-theoretic measures and conditional independence violations, deriving equivalence conditions (e.g., spurious correlation strength and sub-population imbalance).

Result: Predicts and validates (in 6 datasets, 3 architectures) that biases produce quantitatively equivalent effects, enabling debiasing method transfer across domains.

Conclusion: The framework unifies fairness, robustness, and distribution shift literature, proving biases can be analyzed and mitigated under shared principles.

Abstract: Machine learning systems exhibit diverse failure modes: unfairness toward protected groups, brittleness to spurious correlations, poor performance on minority sub-populations, which are typically studied in isolation by distinct research communities. We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $α$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \approx (1+α)/(1-α)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains. This work bridges the literature on fairness, robustness, and distribution shifts under a common perspective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: N-ReLU, a stochastic version of ReLU, replaces negative activations with Gaussian noise to prevent dead neurons while maintaining performance comparable to other activation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of inactive or dead neurons caused by ReLU's hard zero cutoff by introducing stochastic noise.

Method: N-ReLU replaces negative activations with zero-mean Gaussian noise, preserving expected output and acting as a regularizer.

Result: N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly better than ReLU variants on MNIST, with stable convergence and no dead neurons.

Conclusion: Lightweight Gaussian noise injection in N-ReLU enhances optimization robustness without structural changes or extra parameters.

Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental for enabling nonlinear representations in deep neural networks. However, the standard rectified linear unit (ReLU) often suffers from inactive or "dead" neurons caused by its hard zero cutoff. To address this issue, we introduce N-ReLU (Noise-ReLU), a zero-mean stochastic extension of ReLU that replaces negative activations with Gaussian noise while preserving the same expected output. This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed. These results demonstrate that lightweight Gaussian noise injection offers a simple yet effective mechanism to enhance optimization robustness without modifying network structures or introducing additional parameters.

*Georgiy Shakirov,Albert Arakelov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER) improves performance by focusing on semantic patterns rather than node types, enhancing generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGNNs often rely on node/edge type-specific parameters, which can limit cross-type knowledge transfer and overemphasize surface-level labels. This study explores MoE integration to address these limitations.

Method: Proposes HER, an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT), which masks type embeddings during routing to promote type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP datasets for link prediction.

Result: HER outperforms standard HGT and type-separated MoE baselines consistently. Experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming latent semantic-driven routing.

Conclusion: Regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations, establishing a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.

Abstract: A common practice in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) is to condition parameters on node/edge types, assuming types reflect semantic roles. However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.

TL;DR: PAR strategy mitigates OOD issues in offline MARL by updating partial actions, leading to SPaCQL with tighter error bounds and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline MARL faces challenges evaluating OOD joint actions due to distribution shift, especially under factorized behavior policies.

Method: Introduces Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL) using PAR, dynamically weighting strategies based on uncertainty to reduce distribution shift.

Result: Theoretical proof shows linear scaling of distribution shift with deviating agents, yielding tighter error bounds. Empirical results show superior performance.

Conclusion: SPaCQL effectively mitigates OOD issues in offline MARL for factorized policies, outperforming baselines with uncertainty-informed adaptation.

Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is severely hampered by the challenge of evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions. Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes differential privacy (DP) guarantees for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in multi-query settings, introducing two algorithms (MURAG and MURAG-ADA) to enhance privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior DP-RAG work focused on single-query settings, which lacks practicality. The paper addresses the need for privacy-preserving RAG in multi-query scenarios.

Method: Two DP-RAG algorithms are introduced: MURAG, which limits privacy loss based on document retrieval frequency, and MURAG-ADA, which adds query-specific thresholds for better utility.

Result: Experiments show the methods scale to hundreds of queries under practical DP budgets ($\varepsilon\approx10$) while maintaining utility.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms effectively address privacy risks in multi-query RAG settings, balancing privacy and utility.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving documents from an external corpus at inference time. When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents. Our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods scale to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget ($\varepsilon\approx10$), while preserving meaningful utility.

Motivation: Existing single-reservoir models ignore spatial dependencies among interconnected reservoirs, limiting accuracy and utility for water resource management.

Method: AdaTrip uses dynamic graphs with reservoirs as nodes and hydrological connections as edges, employing attention mechanisms to identify key spatial and temporal dependencies.

Result: Evaluated on thirty reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin, AdaTrip outperforms baselines, especially benefiting reservoirs with limited data, and provides interpretable attention maps.

Conclusion: AdaTrip improves multi-reservoir inflow prediction accuracy and interpretability, supporting better water resource management decisions.

Abstract: Reservoir inflow prediction is crucial for water resource management, yet existing approaches mainly focus on single-reservoir models that ignore spatial dependencies among interconnected reservoirs. We introduce AdaTrip as an adaptive, time-varying graph learning framework for multi-reservoir inflow forecasting. AdaTrip constructs dynamic graphs where reservoirs are nodes with directed edges reflecting hydrological connections, employing attention mechanisms to automatically identify crucial spatial and temporal dependencies. Evaluation on thirty reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrates superiority over existing baselines, with improved performance for reservoirs with limited records through parameter sharing. Additionally, AdaTrip provides interpretable attention maps at edge and time-step levels, offering insights into hydrological controls to support operational decision-making.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements, increasing AUC by up to 9% over traditional methods, and provides interpretable insights.

Conclusion: Advanced machine learning significantly enhances crime linkage accuracy and supports investigative decision-making.

Abstract: Effective crime linkage analysis is crucial for identifying serial offenders and enhancing public safety. To address limitations of traditional crime linkage methods in handling high-dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous data, we propose a Siamese Autoencoder framework that learns meaningful latent representations and uncovers correlations in complex crime data. Using data from the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS), maintained by the Serious Crime Analysis Section of the UK's National Crime Agency, our approach mitigates signal dilution in sparse feature spaces by integrating geographic-temporal features at the decoder stage. This design amplifies behavioral representations rather than allowing them to be overshadowed at the input level, yielding consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. We further analyze how different domain-informed data reduction strategies influence model performance, providing practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts. Our results show that advanced machine learning approaches can substantially enhance linkage accuracy, improving AUC by up to 9% over traditional methods while offering interpretable insights to support investigative decision-making.

*Veera V S Bhargav Nunna,Shinae Kang,Zheyuan Zhou,Virginia Wang,Sucharitha Boinapally,Michael Foley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) to identify and group identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets, outperforming traditional NLP methods with 80.95% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise databases contain vast non-semantic data (e.g., IP addresses, timestamps) that challenge semantic analysis. Traditional NLP models struggle with interpretability and scalability.

Method: The CAE encodes text representations of columns at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, extracting high-dimensional feature embeddings for grouping.

Result: The CAE achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks, significantly outperforming Bag of Words (47.62%).

Conclusion: The CAE bridges theory and practice, offering scalable automation for schema understanding and profiling of non-semantic datasets.

Abstract: Enterprise relational databases increasingly contain vast amounts of non-semantic data - IP addresses, product identifiers, encoded keys, and timestamps - that challenge traditional semantic analysis. This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advances in character-level neural architectures and practical enterprise data management challenges, providing an automated solution for schema understanding and data profiling of non-semantic industrial datasets at scale.

*Xiaomeng Yang,Jian Gao,Yanzhi Wang,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSim, a transformer-based framework, enables efficient and scalable performance evaluation for analog circuit design by achieving robust generalization across trained and unseen topologies without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient performance evaluation is a bottleneck in learning-based analog circuit design due to time-consuming SPICE simulations and limited scalability of existing ML methods.

Method: ZeroSim uses a diverse training corpus, unified topology embeddings, and topology-conditioned parameter mapping to achieve generalization.

Result: ZeroSim outperforms baseline models, provides accurate zero-shot predictions, and achieves a 13x speedup in optimization compared to SPICE simulations.

Conclusion: ZeroSim offers practical value for analog circuit design automation by enabling efficient and scalable performance evaluation.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in learning-based analog circuit design automation have tackled tasks such as topology generation, device sizing, and layout synthesis, efficient performance evaluation remains a major bottleneck. Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient, training-free uncertainty estimation method for LLMs to mitigate hallucinations by using top-$K$ probabilities and an adaptive mechanism, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLMs' vulnerability to hallucinations and the inefficiency of existing uncertainty estimation methods requiring multiple samples or extra computation.

Method: Introduces a training-free uncertainty estimation method using top-$K$ probabilities of responses and an adaptive mechanism to dynamically determine $K$.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three free-form question-answering datasets across several LLMs.

Conclusion: Enhances LLM trustworthiness by providing an efficient and effective uncertainty estimation method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect or misleading outputs. Uncertainty estimation, often using predictive entropy estimation, is key to addressing this issue. However, existing methods often require multiple samples or extra computation to assess semantic entropy. This paper proposes an efficient, training-free uncertainty estimation method that approximates predictive entropy using the responses' top-$K$ probabilities. Moreover, we employ an adaptive mechanism to determine $K$ to enhance flexibility and filter out low-confidence probabilities. Experimental results on three free-form question-answering datasets across several LLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms expensive state-of-the-art baselines, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing LLM trustworthiness.

*Brandon Dominique,Prudence Lam,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jochen Weber,Kivanc Kose,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI models for melanoma detection show performance gaps across demographic groups. This paper adds calibration as a metric to assess fairness, revealing biases in existing models despite high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing disparities in AI model performance across demographics is crucial for equitable clinical adoption. Current benchmarks lack insights into model calibration.

Method: The study evaluates top ISIC 2020 Challenge models using AUROC and calibration metrics on ISIC 2020 and PROVE-AI datasets, focusing on sex, race, and age subgroups.

Result: Models improve accuracy but over-diagnose risk and show calibration issues in new datasets, highlighting biases.

Conclusion: Comprehensive auditing and metadata collection are needed for fair AI healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets. This study underscores the necessity for comprehensive model auditing strategies and extensive metadata collection to achieve equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

*Xiaolin Sun,Feidi Liu,Zhengming Ding,ZiZhan Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract discusses vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning (RL) systems to adversarial attacks, particularly in vision-based environments. It critiques existing defenses for relying on weak attack methods and introduces SHIFT, a diffusion-based attack that bypasses current defenses by altering image semantics realistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially in vision-based settings. Current defenses exploit weaknesses in existing attack methods, which fail to alter image semantics effectively. This motivates the development of a more powerful attack.

Method: The authors propose SHIFT, a policy-agnostic, diffusion-based state perturbation attack. It generates perturbed states that are semantically different from true states while remaining realistic and aligned with historical inputs.

Result: SHIFT successfully breaks existing defenses, including advanced ones, outperforming prior attacks in effectiveness and perceptual stealth.

Conclusion: The study underscores RL agents' vulnerability to semantics-aware attacks and stresses the need for more robust policy development.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems, while achieving remarkable success across various domains, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.

TL;DR: A novel Sci-ML framework addresses traditional optimization limitations by using DRL and PINNs for fast, efficient multidimensional solutions, demonstrated via a micromixer case study with a 32% efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the inefficiencies and single-problem focus of traditional simulation-based optimization methods.

Method: Combines Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as an optimizer with parametric Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for rapid, multidimensional problem-solving.

Result: Achieved consistently higher efficiency than baseline, with a 32% improvement at Schmidt number 13.3.

Conclusion: The proposed Sci-ML framework outperforms traditional methods, offering faster, more efficient solutions for complex optimization problems.

Abstract: Multidimensional optimization has consistently been a critical challenge in engineering. However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zoning and ranking-based algorithm for vehicle relocation in car-sharing services, showing 3%-10% performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the Vehicle Relocation Problem in free-floating car-sharing services to optimize vehicle repositioning and personnel transfers.

Method: Divides service areas into zones with similar demand patterns, applies discrete optimization, and uses a fast ranking-based algorithm considering vehicle availability, demand density, and trip durations.

Result: Achieved 8.44% improvement over baseline and compared to a 19.6% improvement with an exact MIP solver, with further potential gains of 3%-10%.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively improves relocation efficiency, though it slightly underperforms compared to exact methods constrained by business rules.

Abstract: The paper addresses the Vehicle Relocation Problem in free-floating car-sharing services by presenting a solution focused on strategies for repositioning vehicles and transferring personnel with the use of scooters. Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\% and 19.6\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules. The analysis of results suggests that, depending on the size of the workforce, the application of the proposed solution allows for improving performance metrics by roughly 3%-10%.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of long-horizon goal-reaching in AI by integrating temporal difference and Monte Carlo methods into a GCRL approach, showing superior performance and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve long-horizon reasoning in AI by effectively estimating temporal distances between observations, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Method: The method integrates temporal difference and Monte Carlo approaches into a GCRL framework, using a quasimetric distance fitted with multistep Monte-Carlo returns.

Result: The method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon tasks (up to 4000 steps) and demonstrates real-world applicability in robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: The proposed GCRL method successfully enables multistep stitching in real-world manipulation tasks from visual observations, marking a significant advancement.

Abstract: Learning how to reach goals in an environment is a longstanding challenge in AI, yet reasoning over long horizons remains a challenge for modern methods. The key question is how to estimate the temporal distance between pairs of observations. While temporal difference methods leverage local updates to provide optimality guarantees, they often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods that perform global updates (e.g., with multi-step returns), which lack such guarantees. We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup). Our approach is the first end-to-end GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in this real-world manipulation domain from an unlabeled offline dataset of visual observations.

TL;DR: Scalable Bayesian optimization for graphs using low-rank spectral representations and Gaussian process surrogates, improving efficiency and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Bayesian optimization to graph-structured domains is challenging due to discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs; existing methods lack scalability or efficiency.

Method: Uses low-rank spectral representations and Gaussian process surrogates with learnable embeddings to infer graph structure and enable efficient global search.

Result: Achieves faster convergence and better optimization performance compared to prior methods, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively addresses scalability and efficiency challenges in Bayesian optimization for graphs.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box objectives, yet extending it to graph-structured domains remains challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations. The method jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, enabling efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation even with limited data. We also provide theoretical analysis establishing conditions for accurate recovery of underlying graph structure under different sampling regimes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel two-stage token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR in MLLMs, outperforming existing approaches by dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation to handle noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing RLVR methods reliant on noisy labeled data and unsupervised techniques prone to overfitting.

Method: A two-stage approach involving token-level entropy maximization (exploration) followed by entropy minimization (exploitation).

Result: Empirical results on MLLMs like Qwen2-VL-2B show consistent performance improvements across noise settings and tasks.

Conclusion: The phased strategy enhances noise tolerance and performance by unifying exploration and exploitation dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is highly dependent on high-quality labeled data, which is often scarce and prone to substantial annotation noise in real-world scenarios. Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board.

TL;DR: Schedule-free methods perform well with limited hyperparameter tuning, and their theory extends to any scheduler, proving optimal convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between theoretical support for constant learning rates and practical use of warm-up schedules in schedule-free methods.

Method: Extend schedule-free convergence theory to accommodate any scheduler, update averaging parameters based on learning rate, and design an adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule.

Result: Achieved optimal convergence rate of O(1/√T) for wsd schedules and demonstrated practical performance on deep neural networks.

Conclusion: The extended theory and new Polyak schedule enhance schedule-free methods' adaptability and performance, validated by experiments.

Abstract: The recently proposed schedule-free method has been shown to achieve strong performance when hyperparameter tuning is limited. The current theory for schedule-free only supports a constant learning rate, where-as the implementation used in practice uses a warm-up schedule. We show how to extend the last-iterate convergence theory of schedule-free to allow for any scheduler, and how the averaging parameter has to be updated as a function of the learning rate. We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. We then use convexity to design a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free. We prove an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence for our new Polyak schedule, and show that it performs well compared to a number of baselines on a black-box model distillation task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in Aurora's black-box nature, hindering its adoption in high-stakes weather forecasting.

Method: Probing Aurora's encoder by training linear classifiers on latent representations to identify physical concepts like land-sea boundaries, extreme temperatures, and atmospheric instability.

Result: Aurora learns physically consistent features but has limitations in capturing rare events.

Conclusion: Interpretability methods are crucial for validating and trusting AI-driven weather models.

Abstract: The high accuracy of large-scale weather forecasting models like Aurora is often accompanied by a lack of transparency, as their internal representations remain largely opaque. This "black box" nature hinders their adoption in high-stakes operational settings. In this work, we probe the physical consistency of Aurora's encoder by investigating whether its latent representations align with known physical and meteorological concepts. Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events. This work underscores the critical need for interpretability methods to validate and build trust in the next generation of Al-driven weather models.

Conclusion: TLDA empowers social scientists to analyze massive corpora efficiently, answering timely theoretical questions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topic modeling method that scales linearly to billions of documents. We make three core contributions: i) we present a topic modeling method, Tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA), that has identifiable and recoverable parameter guarantees and sample complexity guarantees for large data; ii) we show that this method is computationally and memory efficient (achieving speeds over 3-4x those of prior parallelized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods), and that it scales linearly to text datasets with over a billion documents; iii) we provide an open-source, GPU-based implementation, of this method. This scaling enables previously prohibitive analyses, and we perform two real-world, large-scale new studies of interest to political scientists: we provide the first thorough analysis of the evolution of the #MeToo movement through the lens of over two years of Twitter conversation and a detailed study of social media conversations about election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Thus this method provides social scientists with the ability to study very large corpora at scale and to answer important theoretically-relevant questions about salient issues in near real-time.

Motivation: The complexity of modern ML applications necessitates addressing conflicting objectives with coupled variables, highlighting the unexplored potential of MOBL.

Method: The authors propose WC-MHGD, unifying deterministic and stochastic settings, ensuring Pareto-stationarity convergence.

Result: WC-MHGD offers low oracle complexity and systematic Pareto front exploration, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: This work advances MOBL's theoretical and algorithmic foundations, demonstrating practical efficacy.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) applications grow increasingly complex in recent years, modern ML frameworks often need to address multiple potentially conflicting objectives with coupled decision variables across different layers. This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration. We further conduct extensive experiments to confirm our theoretical results.

Motivation: Existing methods like GRPO struggle with iterative decision-making tasks, prompting the need for a framework that incorporates self-correction and feedback.

Method: Murphy integrates iterative self-correction during training, using both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback to refine reasoning across multiple turns.

Result: Murphy improves performance, achieving up to an 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO on code generation benchmarks with models like Qwen and OLMo.

Conclusion: Murphy demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating iterative feedback and self-correction in enhancing LLM reasoning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce Murphy, a multi-turn reflective optimization framework that extends GRPO by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. By leveraging both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback, Murphy enables models to progressively refine their reasoning across multiple turns. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with model families such as Qwen and OLMo show that Murphy consistently improves performance, achieving up to a 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO, on similar compute budgets.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of implementing differentially private optimizers that maintain strong performance while ensuring privacy, the paper explores DP-AdamW and its variant DP-AdamW-BC.

Method: Theoretical analysis of privacy and convergence guarantees for DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC, followed by empirical evaluation across various privacy budgets.

Result: DP-AdamW outperforms other DP optimizers (e.g., DP-SGD, DP-Adam) in tasks like text and image classification, while DP-AdamW-BC consistently reduces accuracy.

Conclusion: DP-AdamW is a strong DP optimizer, but bias correction in DP-AdamW-BC does not improve performance, contrasting with other DP optimizers.

Abstract: As deep learning methods increasingly utilize sensitive data on a widespread scale, differential privacy (DP) offers formal guarantees to protect against information leakage during model training. A significant challenge remains in implementing DP optimizers that retain strong performance while preserving privacy. Recent advances introduced ever more efficient optimizers, with AdamW being a popular choice for training deep learning models because of strong empirical performance. We study \emph{DP-AdamW} and introduce \emph{DP-AdamW-BC}, a differentially private variant of the AdamW optimizer with DP bias correction for the second moment estimator. We start by showing theoretical results for privacy and convergence guarantees of DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC. Then, we empirically analyze the behavior of both optimizers across multiple privacy budgets ($ε= 1, 3, 7$). We find that DP-AdamW outperforms existing state-of-the-art differentially private optimizers like DP-SGD, DP-Adam, and DP-AdamBC, scoring over 15\% higher on text classification, up to 5\% higher on image classification, and consistently 1\% higher on graph node classification. Moreover, we empirically show that incorporating bias correction in DP-AdamW (DP-AdamW-BC) consistently decreases accuracy, in contrast to the improvement of DP-AdamBC improvement over DP-Adam.

### [207] [A General Method for Proving Networks Universal Approximation Property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07857)
*Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular framework called Universal Approximation Module (UAM) to unify proofs of universal approximation properties across diverse deep learning architectures, avoiding redundant model-specific proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proofs for universal approximation in deep learning are architecture-specific, redundant, and lack a common foundation, hindering unified theoretical understanding.

Method: The paper defines a Universal Approximation Module (UAM) as a basic building block with universal approximation properties and shows that any network composed of UAMs retains these properties.

Result: The framework unifies analysis of diverse architectures and provides a step-by-step understanding of expressive power evolution in networks.

Conclusion: The proposed UAM framework addresses redundancy and isolation in existing proofs, offering a common foundation for analyzing universal approximation across architectures.

Abstract: Deep learning architectures are highly diverse. To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules. This perspective not only unifies the analysis of diverse architectures but also enables a step-by-step understanding of how expressive power evolves through the network.

*Shihao Li,Jiachen Li,Jiamin Xu,Christopher Martin,Wei Li,Dongmei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Trajectory value's dependence on learning algorithms in policy-gradient control shows a negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation (PE) and marginal value under REINFORCE, due to variance-mediated mechanisms. Stabilization flips this correlation positive, highlighting algorithm relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how trajectory value varies with different learning algorithms in policy-gradient control, focusing on the impact of PE and gradient variance.

Method: Using Trajectory Shapley in an uncertain LQR, the paper analyzes the correlation between PE and marginal value, investigates variance-mediated mechanisms, and tests stabilization techniques like state whitening or Fisher preconditioning.

Result: Under vanilla REINFORCE, PE and marginal value are negatively correlated ($r\approx-0.38$). Stabilization neutralizes this effect, flipping the correlation positive ($r\approx+0.29$). Experiments confirm the mechanism and show complementary roles of Shapley and Leave-One-Out scores.

Conclusion: Trajectory value is algorithm-relative, influenced by variance-mediated mechanisms and stabilization techniques. Shapley and Leave-One-Out scores serve distinct purposes in pruning and identifying toxic subsets.

Abstract: We study how trajectory value depends on the learning algorithm in policy-gradient control. Using Trajectory Shapley in an uncertain LQR, we find a negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation (PE) and marginal value under vanilla REINFORCE ($r\approx-0.38$). We prove a variance-mediated mechanism: (i) for fixed energy, higher PE yields lower gradient variance; (ii) near saddles, higher variance increases escape probability, raising marginal contribution. When stabilized (state whitening or Fisher preconditioning), this variance channel is neutralized and information content dominates, flipping the correlation positive ($r\approx+0.29$). Hence, trajectory value is algorithm-relative. Experiments validate the mechanism and show decision-aligned scores (Leave-One-Out) complement Shapley for pruning, while Shapley identifies toxic subsets.

TL;DR: A hierarchical and meta-cognitive framework improves EEG-based motor imagery classification by using multi-scale processing and uncertainty estimation, enhancing robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address noise and variability in EEG signals for practical BCI deployment by improving classification accuracy and reducing inter-subject variance.

Method: A hierarchical multi-scale signal processing module and introspective uncertainty estimation are applied to EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet backbones for four-class MI classification.

Result: Improved classification accuracy and reduced inter-subject variance across all backbones compared to baselines, indicating better robustness.

Conclusion: Combining multi-scale hierarchical processing with confidence estimation enhances the reliability of MI-based BCI systems.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to decode motor intent from noninvasive neural signals to enable control of external devices, but practical deployment remains limited by noise and variability in motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This work investigates a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class MI classification. We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting. Across all backbones, the proposed components improve average classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variance compared to the corresponding baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials. These results suggest that combining hierarchical multi-scale processing with introspective confidence estimation can enhance the reliability of MI-based BCI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized spectral framework unifying learning dynamics and compression phenomena, offering invariant relations between them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by inconsistencies in empirical scaling laws and recent spectral analyses, the paper aims to unify learning and compression phenomena.

Method: Develops a generalized spectral framework with an asymptotically polynomial function, characterized by spectral–temporal elasticity, to model these phenomena.

Result: The framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and reveals invariant relations between learning and compression.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified spectral approach to understanding learning dynamics and compression, bridging gaps in empirical scaling laws.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws describe how test loss and other performance metrics depend on model size, dataset size, and compute. While such laws are consistent within specific regimes, apparently distinct scaling behaviors have been reported for related settings such as model compression. Motivated by recent progress in spectral analyses of neural representations, this paper develops a \emph{generalized spectral framework} that unifies learning dynamics and compression phenomena under a common functional ansatz. We generalize the spectral evolution function from the linear kernel form $g(λt)=λt$ to an asymptotically polynomial function $g(λ,t;β)$, characterized by an effective spectral--temporal elasticity $ρ(β)$. This framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression

*Ihab Tabbara,Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a conformal prediction-based framework to ensure probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) value functions and policies for autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety assurance is critical for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems, but computing HJ value functions is computationally expensive, and learned approximations may lack guarantees. This motivates the need for a method to provide probabilistic safety assurances.

Method: The authors introduce a conformal prediction (CP) framework to bound uncertainties in learned HJ value functions and policies. CP is used to calibrate switching between unsafe nominal controllers and learned safe policies, and to derive safety guarantees. An ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions is also investigated as a safety filter.

Result: The CP-based framework successfully provides probabilistic safety guarantees for learned HJ value functions and policies, ensuring safer operation of autonomous systems.

Conclusion: The proposed CP framework effectively addresses the uncertainty in learned HJ value functions, offering a practical solution for safety assurance in high-dimensional autonomous systems.

Abstract: Safety assurance is a fundamental requirement for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.

### [212] [Test-driven Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07904)
*Zhao Yu,Xiuping Wu,Liangjun Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) to simplify reward function design in RL by using test functions instead of single rewards, improving task representation and policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward functions in RL are hard to design manually and often lead to suboptimal task representation. TdRL aims to address this challenge by leveraging test functions for clearer task objectives.

Method: TdRL uses pass-fail and indicative tests to define tasks. It includes a proof linking trajectory returns to optimal policies and introduces a lexicographic heuristic for learning trajectory returns. An algorithm implements this framework.

Result: Experiments on DeepMind Control Suite show TdRL matches or surpasses handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with simpler design and multi-objective support.

Conclusion: TdRL provides a new way to represent task objectives, potentially easing reward design challenges in RL applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been recognized as a powerful tool for robot control tasks. RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reproducible, controllable benchmark for studying rule inference in models under tight budgets, decoupled from anthropomorphic priors.

Method: CellARC uses multicolor 1D cellular automata with adjustable parameters (alphabet size, radius, rule family, etc.) and provides 95k training episodes plus test splits for evaluation.

Result: A 10M-parameter transformer outperforms recursive models (58.0%/32.4% accuracy), while GPT-5 High achieves 62.3%/48.1%. An ensemble model reaches 65.4%/35.5%.

Conclusion: CellARC effectively benchmarks model generalization and rule inference, demonstrating neuro-symbolic complementarity.

Abstract: We introduce CellARC, a synthetic benchmark for abstraction and reasoning built from multicolor 1D cellular automata (CA). Each episode has five support pairs and one query serialized in 256 tokens, enabling rapid iteration with small models while exposing a controllable task space with explicit knobs for alphabet size k, radius r, rule family, Langton's lambda, query coverage, and cell entropy. We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines. CellARC decouples generalization from anthropomorphic priors, supports unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling, and enables reproducible studies of how quickly models infer new rules under tight budgets. Our strongest small-model baseline (a 10M-parameter vanilla transformer) outperforms recent recursive models (TRM, HRM), reaching 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on the interpolation/extrapolation splits, while a large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on subsets of 100 test tasks. An ensemble that chooses per episode between the Transformer and the best symbolic baseline reaches 65.4%/35.5%, highlighting neuro-symbolic complementarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the generative performance of RF models by leveraging π-noise, inspired by recent findings on noise injection via SDEs.

Method: Rectified Noise (ΔRN) is introduced as a pipeline to transform pre-trained RF models into π-noise generators by injecting π-noise into their velocity fields.

Result: Experiments show RF models with ΔRN reduce FID from 10.16 to 9.05 on ImageNet-1k and achieve better performance with only 0.39% extra parameters.

Conclusion: Rectified Noise effectively enhances RF models' generative performance with negligible computational overhead, validated across diverse datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Rectified Flow (RF) has been widely used as an effective generative model. Although RF is primarily based on probability flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), recent studies have shown that injecting noise through reverse-time Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) for sampling can achieve superior generative performance. Inspired by Positive-incentive Noise ($π$-noise), we propose an innovative generative algorithm to train $π$-noise generators, namely Rectified Noise ($Δ$RN), which improves the generative performance by injecting $π$-noise into the velocity field of pre-trained RF models. After introducing the Rectified Noise pipeline, pre-trained RF models can be efficiently transformed into $π$-noise generators. We validate Rectified Noise by conducting extensive experiments across various model architectures on different datasets. Notably, we find that: (1) RF models using Rectified Noise reduce FID from \textbf{10.16 to 9.05} on ImageNet-1k. (2) The models of $π$-noise generators achieve improved performance with only \textbf{0.39\%} additional training parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feedback Descent optimizes text artifacts using structured textual feedback instead of scalar rewards, outperforming existing methods in diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods compress critiques to binary preferences, limiting optimization potential. Feedback Descent aims to widen the information bottleneck by preserving detailed textual feedback.

Method: The framework uses structured feedback as high-bandwidth supervision for targeted edits, leveraging in-context learning to convert critiques into directional information without modifying model weights.

Result: Feedback Descent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prompt optimization, reinforcement learning, and molecular optimization, achieving top percentile results in molecule discovery.

Conclusion: Feedback Descent demonstrates the effectiveness of structured feedback for optimizing text artifacts, offering a task-agnostic and efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Feedback Descent}, a framework that optimizes text artifacts -- prompts, code, and molecules -- through structured textual feedback, rather than relying solely on scalar rewards. By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers. In the DOCKSTRING molecule discovery benchmark, Feedback Descent identifies novel drug-like molecules surpassing the $99.9$th percentile of a database with more than $260{,}000$ compounds across six protein targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SERL is a self-improving RL framework for LLMs, using the model itself as Actor and Judge with internal reward mechanisms, outperforming existing methods and achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL methods struggle with subjectivity and reliance on external rewards in open-domain tasks, prompting the need for a self-improving framework.

Method: SERL uses Copeland-style pairwise comparisons and self-consistency rewards to refine both Actor and Judge capabilities internally.

Result: SERL boosts Qwen3-8B's LC win rate from 52.37% to 59.90%, matching larger models like Qwen3-32B.

Conclusion: SERL demonstrates superior effectiveness and robustness in open-domain tasks, setting a new benchmark for self-improving approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches. Furthermore, it achieves a performance comparable to significantly larger models like Qwen3-32B, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness on open-domain tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation (IBMA) for time series forecasting, combining imputation and Mixup to enhance model performance. It outperforms other augmentation methods in most cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting lacks advanced augmentation techniques compared to fields like images or text. The authors aim to fill this gap with IBMA.

Method: IBMA combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation. It is tested on DLinear, TimesNet, and iTrainformer models using four datasets.

Result: IBMA outperformed other methods in 22 out of 24 cases, with 10 being the best performances, especially with iTrainformer.

Conclusion: IBMA is effective for improving time series forecasting performance, demonstrating its superiority over other augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Data augmentation in time series forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing model performance by introducing variability while maintaining the underlying temporal patterns. However, time series data offers fewer augmentation strategies compared to fields such as image or text, with advanced techniques like Mixup rarely being used. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation (IBMA), which combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation to bolster model generalization and improve forecasting performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting. Our experiments, conducted on four datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and compared against eight other augmentation techniques, demonstrate that IBMA consistently enhances performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 of those being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decision-focused continual learning framework for power-logistics scheduling in seaports, improving adaptability to evolving task structures and enhancing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor generalization in existing predict-then-optimize pipelines caused by fixed task configurations in downstream optimization.

Method: Proposes a framework with Fisher information-based regularization and a differentiable convex surrogate for stable gradient backpropagation.

Result: Demonstrates superior decision performance and generalization in Jurong Port experiments, with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns decision-aligned forecasting models for new tasks while retaining performance on prior tasks.

Abstract: Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance decision quality, decision-focused learning has been proposed to align forecasting and optimization via end-to-end training. However, most formulations assume a fixed task configuration in downstream optimization, and thus generalize poorly to evolving task structures induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.

*Rishabh Agrawal,Yusuf Alvi,Rahul Jain,Ashutosh Nayyar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust offline imitation learning framework that handles dynamic shifts between training and deployment, using expert demonstrations under nominal dynamics without additional interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard IL methods assume fixed environment dynamics, but shifts due to modeling errors or real-world variations degrade performance. The paper aims to mitigate this by learning robust policies from nominal data alone.

Method: The framework uses distributionally robust optimization over transition models, minimizing imitation loss under worst-case dynamics. It reformulates the objective using nominal data for tractable offline learning.

Result: Empirical tests on continuous-control benchmarks show superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL methods, especially in perturbed environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses dynamic shifts in IL, offering reliable performance without requiring additional environment interaction.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has proven highly effective for robotic and control tasks where manually designing reward functions or explicit controllers is infeasible. However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study on continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models reveals rapid utility collapse due to cumulative parameter drift. Proposed gradient-projection method and regularizers improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods assume batch requests, but sequential requests degrade model performance. Addressing this gap is crucial for practical applications.

Method: Analyze cumulative parameter drift, propose add-on regularizers, and introduce a gradient-projection method to constrain drift orthogonal to subspaces.

Result: Regularizers mitigate drift, and the gradient-projection method significantly improves continual unlearning, preserving retained knowledge better.

Conclusion: Continual unlearning is critical for safe generative AI. Insights and proposed methods offer baselines for future advancements.

Abstract: Machine unlearning--the ability to remove designated concepts from a pre-trained model--has advanced rapidly, particularly for text-to-image diffusion models. However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZO methods suffer from high variance and suboptimal search directions during gradient estimation.

Method: LOREN reformulates gradient preconditioning, uses a low-rank block diagonal preconditioner for curvature, and applies a REINFORCE leave-one-out estimator to reduce variance.

Result: LOREN outperforms state-of-the-art ZO methods in accuracy and convergence, reducing peak memory usage by up to 27.3%.

Conclusion: LOREN provides an effective solution for fine-tuning LLMs with improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: We introduce LOREN, a curvature-aware zeroth-order (ZO) optimization method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Existing ZO methods, which estimate gradients via finite differences using random perturbations, often suffer from high variance and suboptimal search directions. Our approach addresses these challenges by: (i) reformulating the problem of gradient preconditioning as that of adaptively estimating an anisotropic perturbation distribution for gradient estimation, (ii) capturing curvature through a low-rank block diagonal preconditioner using the framework of natural evolution strategies, and (iii) applying a REINFORCE leave-one-out (RLOO) gradient estimator to reduce variance. Experiments on standard LLM benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZO methods by achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence, while cutting peak memory usage by up to 27.3% compared with MeZO-Adam.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a Graph Transformer architecture that unifies advancements in attention mechanisms and positional embeddings, offering strong performance across diverse tasks without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Transformer architectures lack generalized insights due to varied design choices and limited empirical validation, creating a gap between theory and practice.

Method: The authors propose GDT, incorporating standard attention and recent advancements, and analyze its representation power regarding attention and positional embeddings through extensive experiments.

Result: GDT shows consistent performance across diverse tasks (e.g., object detection, molecular prediction) in large-scale evaluations (eight million graphs, 270M tokens), even in few-shot transfer settings.

Conclusion: The study provides generalizable insights into effective GT design, training, and inference, bridging the gap between theoretical expressivity and practical performance.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown strong empirical performance, yet current architectures vary widely in their use of attention mechanisms, positional embeddings (PEs), and expressivity. Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning. We distill our theoretical and practical findings into several generalizable insights about effective GT design, training, and inference.

### [223] [From Sequential to Recursive: Enhancing Decision-Focused Learning with Bidirectional Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08035)
*Xinyu Wang,Jinxiao Du,Yiyang Peng,Wei Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a framework with bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization, outperforming sequential baselines in decision quality and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential DFL frameworks fail to capture bidirectional feedback in complex scenarios, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes R-DFL with bidirectional feedback and extends two differentiation methods: explicit unrolling and implicit differentiation.

Result: R-DFL significantly improves decision quality over sequential baselines and shows robustness in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: R-DFL offers a superior alternative to sequential DFL by enabling bidirectional feedback and efficient gradient propagation.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) has emerged as a powerful end-to-end alternative to conventional predict-then-optimize (PTO) pipelines by directly optimizing predictive models through downstream decision losses. Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL. We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the newsvendor problem and the bipartite matching problem, demonstrate that R-DFL not only substantially enhances the final decision quality over sequential baselines but also exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.

*Xueliang Zhao,Wei Wu,Jian Guan,Qintong Li,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynaAct, a framework for automatically building compact action spaces to improve sequential decision-making, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of manual or unstructured action spaces in sequential decision-making, aiming for scalability and computational efficiency.

Method: Estimates a proxy action space using large language models, formulates a submodular function for utility and diversity, and selects optimal actions with a greedy algorithm.

Result: Significant performance improvements on six benchmarks, with efficient inference and minimal latency.

Conclusion: DynaAct effectively enhances sequential reasoning by constructing compact action spaces, balancing utility and diversity.

Abstract: In modern sequential decision-making systems, the construction of an optimal candidate action space is critical to efficient inference. However, existing approaches either rely on manually defined action spaces that lack scalability or utilize unstructured spaces that render exhaustive search computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named \textsc{DynaAct} for automatically constructing a compact action space to enhance sequential reasoning in complex problem-solving scenarios. Our method first estimates a proxy for the complete action space by extracting general sketches observed in a corpus covering diverse complex reasoning problems using large language models. We then formulate a submodular function that jointly evaluates candidate actions based on their utility to the current state and their diversity, and employ a greedy algorithm to select an optimal candidate set. Extensive experiments on six diverse standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall performance, while maintaining efficient inference without introducing substantial latency. The implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaoxlpku/DynaAct.

### [225] [Online Linear Regression with Paid Stochastic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08073)
*Nadav Merlis,Kyoungseok Jang,Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores online linear regression with noisy feature vectors, where learners can pay to reduce noise. It analyzes regret rates under known and unknown noise covariance conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address scenarios where feature accuracy can be improved at a cost, such as using better equipment or incentivizing data providers, and analyzes the trade-off between prediction error and payment.

Method: The paper assumes i.i.d. feature vectors from an unknown distribution and evaluates regret against a loss-minimizing linear predictor. It uses matrix martingale concentration to show uniform convergence of empirical loss to expected loss.

Result: For known noise covariance, the optimal regret rate is √𝑇 (ignoring logs), while for unknown covariance, it rises to 𝑇^(2/3) (ignoring logs).

Conclusion: The findings highlight the impact of noise covariance knowledge on regret rates, providing insights for cost-sensitive feature learning in online regression.

Abstract: We study an online linear regression setting in which the observed feature vectors are corrupted by noise and the learner can pay to reduce the noise level. In practice, this may happen for several reasons: for example, because features can be measured more accurately using more expensive equipment, or because data providers can be incentivized to release less private features. Assuming feature vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed but unknown distribution, we measure the learner's regret against the linear predictor minimizing a notion of loss that combines the prediction error and payment. When the mapping between payments and noise covariance is known, we prove that the rate $\sqrt{T}$ is optimal for regret if logarithmic factors are ignored. When the noise covariance is unknown, we show that the optimal regret rate becomes of order $T^{2/3}$ (ignoring log factors). Our analysis leverages matrix martingale concentration, showing that the empirical loss uniformly converges to the expected one for all payments and linear predictors.

*Jinbo Li,Peng Liu,Long Chen,Witold Pedrycz,Weiping Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework combining Gradient Boosting and Fuzzy Rule-Based Models to enhance performance and interpretability while addressing scalability and overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like complex design and scalability in Fuzzy Rule-Based Models by integrating them with Gradient Boosting.

Method: A dynamic control factor optimizes each Fuzzy Rule-Based Model's contribution in the ensemble, preventing dominance and encouraging diversity. A sample-based correction mechanism adapts based on validation feedback.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance, reduced overfitting, and maintained interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully merges the strengths of both paradigms, simplifying model maintenance and enhancing scalability.

Abstract: The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HipKittens (HK), a programming framework for high-performance AI kernels on AMD GPUs, adapting tile-based abstractions from NVIDIA-focused DSLs like ThunderKittens (TK).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify high-performance AI kernel development on AMD GPUs, which traditionally requires hand-optimized assembly, the study explores generalizing tile-based programming primitives from NVIDIA to AMD.

Method: The authors analyze programming primitives for AMD GPUs, encapsulate insights into HK, and validate performance on CDNA3 and CDNA4 platforms.

Result: HK kernels match or exceed hand-optimized AMD assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, outperform compiler baselines, and sometimes surpass all baselines by 1.2-2.4x.

Conclusion: Tile-based abstractions generalize to AMD GPUs, but require algorithmic rethinking; HK paves the way for a vendor-agnostic, high-performance AI kernel framework.

Abstract: AMD GPUs offer state-of-the-art compute and memory bandwidth; however, peak performance AMD kernels are written in raw assembly. To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors. HipKittens is released at: https://github.com/HazyResearch/HipKittens.

*Muthukumar Pandaram,Jakob Hollenstein,David Drexel,Samuele Tosatto,Antonio Rodríguez-Sánchez,Justus Piater*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines assumptions about sparsity in learned dynamics models for reinforcement learning, finding that global sparsity is rare but local, state-dependent sparsity exists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity hold in real-world robotic reinforcement learning tasks.

Method: Analyzing ground-truth dynamics from MuJoCo Playground environments to study causal graph sparsity, state-dependence, and temporal changes.

Result: Global sparsity is rare; instead, local, state-dependent sparsity appears in clusters (e.g., during contact) and affects specific state dimensions.

Conclusion: Common sparsity assumptions are challenged, highlighting the need for inductive biases that align with state-dependent sparsity structures.

Abstract: The use of learned dynamics models, also known as world models, can improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.
  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.
  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.
  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing a physics-inspired architecture based on Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics.

Method: Developed the SLGNN, utilizing Stuart-Landau oscillators to dynamically evolve node feature amplitudes and phases, with tunable hyperparameters controlling their interplay with network structure.

Result: SLGNN outperforms existing Oscillatory Graph Neural Networks (OGNNs) in node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks.

Conclusion: SLGNN provides a theoretically grounded and expressive framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs, offering improved performance and control.

Abstract: Oscillatory Graph Neural Networks (OGNNs) are an emerging class of physics-inspired architectures designed to mitigate oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep GNNs. In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of standardized sustainability evaluations for AI systems and proposes a comprehensive protocol for long-term sustainability assessment in ML models, showing that traditional methods fail to capture real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sustainability and efficiency in AI systems are critical, but current practices lack standardized evaluation protocols, especially for long-term lifecycle assessments.

Method: The authors propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing long-term sustainability in ML models, tested on diverse classification tasks using various model types.

Result: Traditional static evaluations don’t reliably measure sustainability under evolving data and updates. Long-term sustainability varies across models, with high environmental costs often not justifying performance gains.

Conclusion: A standardized, long-term sustainability evaluation protocol is necessary, as traditional methods overlook real-world AI lifecycle impacts and fail to balance performance with environmental costs.

Abstract: Sustainability and efficiency have become essential considerations in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence systems, yet existing regulatory and reporting practices lack standardized, model-agnostic evaluation protocols. Current assessments often measure only short-term experimental resource usage and disproportionately emphasize batch learning settings, failing to reflect real-world, long-term AI lifecycles. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing the long-term sustainability of ML models, applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios. Through experiments on diverse classification tasks using a range of model types, we demonstrate that traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates. Our results show that long-term sustainability varies significantly across models, and in many cases, higher environmental cost yields little performance benefit.

*Returaj Burnwal,Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeMIL introduces offline safe imitation learning using non-preferred trajectories to avoid risky behavior while maintaining reward performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and specifying reward and safety costs is challenging. Non-preferred trajectories provide implicit guidance on behaviors to avoid.

Method: SafeMIL uses Multiple Instance Learning to learn a parameterized cost predicting risky state-action pairs, then avoids non-preferred behaviors for a safer policy.

Result: Empirical results show SafeMIL learns safer policies satisfying cost constraints without degrading reward performance, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: SafeMIL effectively combines imitation learning with safety constraints using non-preferred trajectories, offering practical advantages in risky environments.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL). In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.

TL;DR: BIPPO is an energy-efficient RL solution for client selection in FL, improving accuracy and minimizing resource use in IoT systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL lacks infrastructure efficiency and scalability, especially in resource-constrained IoT environments, which existing RL solutions do not adequately address.

Method: Proposes BIPPO, a multi-agent RL approach optimized for energy efficiency and generalizability, tested on image classification tasks with non-IID data.

Result: BIPPO outperforms non-RL methods and traditional RL approaches in accuracy while using minimal budget, maintaining stability and scalability.

Conclusion: BIPPO provides a sustainable and performant solution for client selection in FL-IoT systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning solution in large-scale IoT systems, guaranteeing load distribution and privacy. However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases. Overall, BIPPO delivers a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL.

Motivation: Existing neural CFR methods struggle with advanced variants, limiting their effectiveness in large imperfect-information games.

Method: The proposed algorithm uses variance-reduced sampled advantages, bootstrapping for cumulative advantages, and simulates advanced CFR updates via discounting and clipping.

Result: It outperforms model-free neural algorithms in convergence speed and adversarial performance in poker.

Conclusion: The new neural CFR algorithm successfully addresses limitations of existing methods, enhancing applicability in large games.

Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. To enhance CFR's applicability in large games, researchers use neural networks to approximate its behavior. However, existing methods are mainly based on vanilla CFR and struggle to effectively integrate more advanced CFR variants. In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants. At each iteration, it collects variance-reduced sampled advantages based on a value network, fits cumulative advantages by bootstrapping, and applies discounting and clipping operations to simulate the update mechanisms of advanced CFR variants. Experimental results show that, compared with model-free neural algorithms, it exhibits faster convergence in typical imperfect-information games and demonstrates stronger adversarial performance in a large poker game.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive, and existing Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) struggle with long-range interactions and error accumulation during autoregressive rollouts. IGNS aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: IGNS incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics principles, includes a warmup phase for global context, uses geometric encoding for irregular meshes, and employs a multi-step training objective to minimize rollout errors.

Result: IGNS consistently surpasses state-of-the-art GNSs in accuracy and stability, especially in tasks involving long-range dependencies and external forces.

Conclusion: IGNS offers a robust solution for simulating complex physical systems, addressing key limitations of current methods and demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Learning to simulate complex physical systems from data has emerged as a promising way to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical solvers, which often require prohibitive computational costs for high-fidelity solutions. Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios. Across all tasks, IGNS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNSs, achieving higher accuracy and stability under challenging and complex dynamical systems.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current Continual Learning (CL) methods for relying on a priori data knowledge and introduces OPRE, an online dataset compression algorithm, showing superior performance on CIFAR datasets with minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in neural networks and advocate for more agnostic CL methods, the paper highlights biases in existing approaches, such as pretrained feature extractors.

Method: Introduces OPRE, an online dataset compression algorithm combined with classifier training at test time, minimizing assumptions about future data.

Result: OPRE outperforms other state-of-the-art online CL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrating effectiveness with minimal a priori data knowledge.

Conclusion: Online dataset compression, exemplified by OPRE, is suggested as essential for achieving fully agnostic CL, reducing reliance on biased assumptions.

Abstract: In order to achieve Continual Learning (CL), the problem of catastrophic forgetting, one that has plagued neural networks since their inception, must be overcome. The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other. We argue that most CL methods introduce a priori information about the data to come and cannot be considered agnostic. We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods. Additionally, OPRE requires only minimal and interpretable hypothesis on the data to come. We suggest that online dataset compression could well be necessary to achieve fully agnostic CL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-branch framework called DTAF tackles non-stationarity in time series forecasting by addressing temporal and spectral shifts separately and fusing the results for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series often suffer from non-stationarity (temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability), making long-term forecasting challenging.

Method: DTAF uses Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) to handle temporal non-stationarity and Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) for spectral shifts, combining their outputs for robust forecasts.

Result: DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

Conclusion: DTAF effectively addresses non-stationarity in time series forecasting by combining temporal and frequency domain approaches, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

TL;DR: PrefPoE introduces a Preference-Product-of-Experts framework for advantage-guided exploration in RL, improving performance and stability across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive entropy maximization in RL leads to high variance and inefficient policy updates, necessitating a better exploration-exploitation balance.

Method: PrefPoE trains a preference network to focus on high-advantage actions, fusing it with the main policy via PoE to create a soft trust region.

Result: PrefPoE achieves significant performance gains (e.g., +321% on HalfCheetah-v4) with improved training stability and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Advantage-guided exploration via PrefPoE enhances policy gradient methods, proving the importance of learning where to explore.

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning remains a critical challenge, as naive entropy maximization often results in high variance and inefficient policy updates. We introduce \textbf{PrefPoE}, a novel \textit{Preference-Product-of-Experts} framework that performs intelligent, advantage-guided exploration via the first principled application of product-of-experts (PoE) fusion for single-task exploration-exploitation balancing. By training a preference network to concentrate probability mass on high-advantage actions and fusing it with the main policy through PoE, PrefPoE creates a \textbf{soft trust region} that stabilizes policy updates while maintaining targeted exploration. Across diverse control tasks spanning both continuous and discrete action spaces, PrefPoE demonstrates consistent improvements: +321\% on HalfCheetah-v4 (1276~$\rightarrow$~5375), +69\% on Ant-v4, +276\% on LunarLander-v2, with consistently enhanced training stability and sample efficiency. Unlike standard PPO, which suffers from entropy collapse, PrefPoE sustains adaptive exploration through its unique dynamics, thereby preventing premature convergence and enabling superior performance. Our results establish that learning \textit{where to explore} through advantage-guided preferences is as crucial as learning how to act, offering a general framework for enhancing policy gradient methods across the full spectrum of reinforcement learning domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding Transformer components like positional encoding and attention mechanisms by linking them to spatial functions on continuous manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a unified physical or mathematical interpretation of Transformer components, such as positional encoding and attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose mapping discrete positions (e.g., text tokens or pixel coordinates) to spatial functions on continuous manifolds, framing Transformer layers as kernel-modulated operators over embedded manifolds.

Result: The framework enables a field-theoretic interpretation of Transformer layers, integrating positional encoding, kernel integral operators, and attention mechanisms theoretically.

Conclusion: The study concludes with a structural theoretical framework that unifies and interprets Transformer components mathematically and physically.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has achieved tremendous success in natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific computing through its self-attention mechanism. However, its core components-positional encoding and attention mechanisms-have lacked a unified physical or mathematical interpretation. This paper proposes a structural theoretical framework that integrates positional encoding, kernel integral operators, and attention mechanisms for in-depth theoretical investigation. We map discrete positions (such as text token indices and image pixel coordinates) to spatial functions on continuous manifolds, enabling a field-theoretic interpretation of Transformer layers as kernel-modulated operators acting over embedded manifolds.

*Fedor Sergeev,Manuel Burger,Polina Leshetkina,Vincent Fortuin,Gunnar Rätsch,Rita Kuznetsova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to automatically learn feature groups in clinical time series data by clustering embedding layer weights, improving predictive performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical time series data are complex and heterogeneous, making manual feature grouping challenging. Automating this process can enhance deep learning model performance and provide interpretable insights.

Method: The method clusters weights of feature-wise embedding layers during supervised training to discover optimal feature groups for the prediction task.

Result: The approach outperforms static clustering on synthetic data and matches expert-defined groups on real-world medical data, while also offering interpretable feature relationships.

Conclusion: Automated feature grouping through embedding weight clustering is effective, outperforming manual methods and providing clinically meaningful insights.

Abstract: Clinical time series data are critical for patient monitoring and predictive modeling. These time series are typically multivariate and often comprise hundreds of heterogeneous features from different data sources. The grouping of features based on similarity and relevance to the prediction task has been shown to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures. However, defining these groups a priori using only semantic knowledge is challenging, even for domain experts. To address this, we propose a novel method that learns feature groups by clustering weights of feature-wise embedding layers. This approach seamlessly integrates into standard supervised training and discovers the groups that directly improve downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks. We demonstrate that our method outperforms static clustering approaches on synthetic data and achieves performance comparable to expert-defined groups on real-world medical data. Moreover, the learned feature groups are clinically interpretable, enabling data-driven discovery of task-relevant relationships between variables.

*Yi Cai,Thibaud Ardoin,Mayank Gulati,Gerhard Wunder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in evaluating feature attribution explanations due to distribution shifts from input manipulations. It identifies the 'sign issue' as a key problem and proposes reframed evaluation methods to improve reliability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate explanation quality in feature attribution methods, which lacks ground-truth benchmarks, and address inconsistencies in retraining-based evaluation schemes like ROAR.

Method: Analyze the 'sign issue' causing misalignment in evaluations, propose reframed evaluation processes, and introduce novel variants for efficient explainer benchmarking.

Result: The proposed methods resolve evaluation distortions, improve efficiency, and provide deeper insights into explainer performance across data scales.

Conclusion: Reframed evaluation schemes enhance reliability and practicality for explainer selection, revealing open challenges and future directions in explainability research.

Abstract: Feature attribution has gained prominence as a tool for explaining model decisions, yet evaluating explanation quality remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth explanations. To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking. Following our proposed schemes, empirical results across various data scales provide deeper insights into the performance of carefully selected explainers, revealing open challenges and future directions in explainability research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) framework to overcome scalability and computational challenges in large-scale graphs by using a compact network of node sets and kernelized contrastive loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scalability and computational inefficiencies of Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) on large-scale graphs, which stem from intensive message passing and quadratic complexity of contrastive loss.

Method: The method involves transforming the graph into interconnected node sets, introducing a kernelized community contrastive loss with linear complexity, and using knowledge distillation in a decoupled GNN architecture.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in effectiveness and scalability, as validated by experiments on sixteen real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GCL framework successfully addresses scalability and computational challenges while maintaining strong performance, making it suitable for large-scale graph applications.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the absence of task-specific labels. However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.

### [242] [Test-time Diverse Reasoning by Riemannian Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08305)
*Ly Tran Ho Khanh,Dongxuan Zhu,Man-Chung Yue,Viet Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Best-of-N reasoning enhances language model accuracy by selecting the best solution from multiple candidates, but suffers from limited output diversity. The paper proposes an unsupervised activation steering strategy to maximize reasoning path variance, using Riemannian optimization and block-coordinate descent, achieving better diversity and accuracy in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of variance in reasoning paths generated by language models under Best-of-N sampling, which often leads to repeated errors despite stochastic sampling.

Method: The method involves unsupervised activation steering to optimize steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories simultaneously. It solves a Riemannian optimization problem over spheres using a log-determinant objective and applies steering vectors via block-coordinate descent.

Result: Empirical results show the proposed strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in generative diversity and solution accuracy on mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights that test-time Riemannian activation steering effectively improves diversity and accuracy in language model reasoning, surpassing traditional sampling methods.

Abstract: Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.

### [243] [Improving the accuracy and generalizability of molecular property regression models with a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08314)
*Xiaoyu Fan,Lin Guo,Ruizhen Jia,Yang Tian,Zhihao Yang,Boxue Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolRuleLoss is a framework improving molecular property prediction accuracy and generalizability by incorporating substructure-substitution rules into model loss functions, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models often perform poorly in molecular property prediction, especially for out-of-distribution molecules. MolRuleLoss aims to address these accuracy and generalizability issues.

Method: MolRuleLoss integrates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules into molecular property regression models' loss functions.

Result: Performance improvements ranged from 2.6% to 33.3% across various tasks, with notable gains in lipophilicity, solubility, and solvation-free energy predictions. It also enhanced generalizability for activity cliff and OOD molecules.

Conclusion: MolRuleLoss significantly boosts prediction accuracy and generalizability of molecular property regression models, supporting broader applications in drug discovery and cheminformatics.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided drug discovery is an active research field, yet AI models often exhibit poor accuracy in regression tasks for molecular property prediction, and perform catastrophically poorly for out-of-distribution (OOD) molecules. Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for "activity cliff" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery.

*Eunice Chan,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how adversarial poisoning can intentionally compromise fairness in naive Bayes classifiers by injecting crafted data points, outperforming existing methods in degrading fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of research on fairness vulnerability in AI systems, focusing on how fairness can be intentionally compromised.

Method: Theoretical analysis and adversarial poisoning strategy involving injecting crafted data points into training sets to bias naive Bayes classifiers.

Result: The attack significantly degrades fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, achieving higher unfairness with minimal accuracy impact.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates a robust way to compromise fairness in AI systems, highlighting vulnerabilities that need addressing.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI and machine learning systems in real-world applications, ensuring their fairness has become increasingly critical. The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy. Notably, our method proves effective on a wide range of models, in contrast to prior work, demonstrating a robust and potent approach to compromising the fairness of machine learning systems.

*Ruiyu Qiu,Rui Wang,Guanghui Yang,Xiang Li,Zhijiang Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LPPG-RL, a novel Lexicographic Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning framework for continuous spaces, addressing limitations of existing methods through sequential gradient projections and Subproblem Exploration, with theoretical guarantees and superior performance demonstrated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending RL to lexicographic multi-objective problems with explicit priorities is challenging due to inefficient priority enforcement in traditional Safe RL and MORL methods, and limitations in existing LMORL approaches (heuristic tuning or discrete domains).

Method: Proposes LPPG-RL, leveraging sequential gradient projections for feasible policy updates, reformulating projections as optimizations using Dykstra's method for speed, and introducing Subproblem Exploration to avoid gradient vanishing and improve stability.

Result: LPPG-RL outperforms existing continuous LMORL methods in experiments (e.g., 2D navigation), with theoretical convergence guarantees and a lower bound on policy improvement.

Conclusion: LPPG-RL is a robust LMORL framework for continuous spaces, overcoming prior limitations with efficient projections and exploration techniques, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Lexicographic multi-objective problems, which consist of multiple conflicting subtasks with explicit priorities, are common in real-world applications. Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of neural networks complicates trust and validation in critical fields like healthcare and finance, necessitating reliable XAI methods.

Method: Develops ProtoScore, integrating Co-12 properties to assess prototype-based XAI methods, focusing on time series data.

Result: Provides a robust framework for objective comparison of XAI methods, aiding practitioners in method selection without costly user studies.

Conclusion: ProtoScore advances XAI evaluation, offering standardized benchmarks for prototype-based explanations.

Abstract: The complexity and opacity of neural networks (NNs) pose significant challenges, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where understanding decision-making processes is crucial. To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HPO algorithms lack the ability to incorporate multi-objective prior knowledge, limiting their effectiveness for DL practitioners.

Method: Introduces PriMO, the first HPO algorithm that integrates multi-objective user beliefs.

Result: PriMO achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 DL benchmarks in both multi-objective and single-objective settings.

Conclusion: PriMO is positioned as the new go-to HPO algorithm for DL practitioners due to its superior performance.

Abstract: While Deep Learning (DL) experts often have prior knowledge about which hyperparameter settings yield strong performance, only few Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms can leverage such prior knowledge and none incorporate priors over multiple objectives. As DL practitioners often need to optimize not just one but many objectives, this is a blind spot in the algorithmic landscape of HPO. To address this shortcoming, we introduce PriMO, the first HPO algorithm that can integrate multi-objective user beliefs. We show PriMO achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 DL benchmarks in the multi-objective and single-objective setting, clearly positioning itself as the new go-to HPO algorithm for DL practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between Transformers and MLP-based models in multivariate time series forecasting by improving inter-channel stability.

Method: Proposes EMAformer, which integrates an auxiliary embedding suite with Transformers and introduces three inductive biases: global stability, phase sensitivity, and cross-axis specificity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 benchmarks, reducing forecasting errors by 2.73% in MSE and 5.15% in MAE.

Conclusion: EMAformer significantly advances Transformer-based approaches for practical multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across a wide range of domains. While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \textit{global stability}, \textit{phase sensitivity}, and \textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\% in MSE and 5.15\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting. The code is available on https://github.com/PlanckChang/EMAformer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models ignore ambiguous negatives, which differ from positives by small details. BACL aims to leverage these borderline cases for better learning.

Method: BACL introduces a Boundary-aware Negative Sampler for gradual difficulty increase and a Contrastive Local Attention loss to pinpoint mismatches. Both modules are differentiable and compatible with existing dual encoders.

Result: The method achieves up to +32% R@1 over CLIP and sets new state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, with an O(1/n) error rate theoretically predicted.

Conclusion: BACL effectively utilizes ambiguous negatives for improved performance, demonstrating its practicality and scalability without requiring additional labels.

Abstract: Most multimodal models treat every negative pair alike, ignoring the ambiguous negatives that differ from the positive by only a small detail. We propose Boundary-Aware Curriculum with Local Attention (BACL), a lightweight add-on that turns these borderline cases into a curriculum signal. A Boundary-aware Negative Sampler gradually raises difficulty, while a Contrastive Local Attention loss highlights where the mismatch occurs. The two modules are fully differentiable and work with any off-the-shelf dual encoder. Theory predicts a fast O(1/n) error rate; practice shows up to +32% R@1 over CLIP and new SOTA on four large-scale benchmarks, all without extra labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of sparse rewards and dynamic interactions in graph-structured MARL adversarial tasks like pursuit and confrontation, aiming to enhance policy learning efficiency.

Method: Proposes ARAC, combining an attention-based GNN for modeling dependencies and adaptive divergence regularization. The GNN captures spatial relations, while the regularization mechanism balances exploration and policy improvement.

Result: ARAC shows faster convergence, higher success rates, and better scalability in varying agent numbers compared to MARL baselines in pursuit and confrontation scenarios.

Conclusion: ARAC effectively tackles sparse rewards and dynamic interactions in graph-structured MARL, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: In graph-structured multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) adversarial tasks such as pursuit and confrontation, agents must coordinate under highly dynamic interactions, where sparse rewards hinder efficient policy learning. We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.

TL;DR: NeuCLIP introduces a novel optimization framework for accurate estimation of the normalization term in CLIP models, overcoming limitations of prior methods like optimization errors and high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating the normalization term in contrastive loss face challenges like computational inefficiency and scalability issues, prompting the need for a more effective solution.

Method: NeuCLIP reformulates the contrastive loss using convex analysis and transforms it via variational analysis into minimizing a neural network predicting log-normalizers. It employs an alternating optimization algorithm for joint training.

Result: NeuCLIP achieves more accurate normalizer estimation and outperforms previous methods in large-scale CLIP training experiments.

Conclusion: NeuCLIP provides a scalable and efficient solution for normalization term estimation in CLIP models, improving performance and reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the normalization term (also known as the partition function) in the contrastive loss is a central challenge for training Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models. Conventional methods rely on large batches for approximation, demanding substantial computational resources. To mitigate this issue, prior works introduced per-sample normalizer estimators, which are updated at each epoch in a blockwise coordinate manner to keep track of updated encoders. However, this scheme incurs optimization error that scales with the ratio of dataset size to batch size, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches. To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network. By employing a tailored architecture and acceleration techniques for the auxiliary network, NeuCLIP achieves more accurate normalizer estimation, leading to improved performance compared with previous methods. Extensive experiments on large-scale CLIP training, spanning datasets from millions to billions of samples, demonstrate that NeuCLIP outperforms previous methods.

TL;DR: PINO models improve cardiac EP simulations by learning function space mappings, enabling high accuracy and scalability across resolutions and scenarios, outperforming traditional PDE solvers and PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solvers are computationally expensive and mesh-dependent, while deep learning methods struggle with chaos and long-term predictions. PINNs help but have resolution and stability limits.

Method: Proposed Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) learns mappings between function spaces, generalizing to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions.

Result: PINO accurately models cardiac EP dynamics across long time spans and unseen scenarios, scales resolution by 10x, and reduces simulation time versus traditional solvers.

Conclusion: PINO offers efficient, scalable cardiac EP simulations, addressing limitations of PINNs and numerical PDE solvers.

Abstract: Accurately simulating systems governed by PDEs, such as voltage fields in cardiac electrophysiology (EP) modelling, remains a significant modelling challenge. Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution. These advantages come with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to numerical PDE solvers, highlighting the potential of PINO-based approaches for efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with enforcing hard constraints during generative sampling, often degrading sample quality. This paper aims to solve this by integrating numerical optimal control techniques.

Method: The framework leverages numerical optimal control and model predictive control to transform constrained sampling into a tractable optimization problem, ensuring constraints are met at the terminal time.

Result: HardFlow significantly outperforms existing methods in diverse domains like robotics, PDEs, and vision, achieving better constraint satisfaction and sample quality.

Conclusion: The proposed HardFlow framework effectively addresses hard constraints in generative modeling, offering flexibility and performance improvements while maintaining sample quality.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.

Abstract: Deep learning has brought significant advancements to X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction, offering solutions to challenges arising from modern imaging technologies. These developments benefit from methods that combine classical reconstruction techniques with data-driven approaches. Differentiable operators play a key role in this integration by enabling end-to-end optimization and the incorporation of physical modeling within neural networks.
  In this work, we present an updated version of PYRO-NN, a Python-based library for differentiable CT reconstruction. The updated framework extends compatibility to PyTorch and introduces native CUDA kernel support for efficient projection and back-projection operations across parallel, fan, and cone-beam geometries. Additionally, it includes tools for simulating imaging artifacts, modeling arbitrary acquisition trajectories, and creating flexible, end-to-end trainable pipelines through a high-level Python API.

### [255] [Coherence Mechanisms for Provable Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08440)
*Mehryar Mohri,Jon Schneider,Yifan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a principled framework for self-improvement in language models using coherence, ensuring consistency under input transformations. It provides theoretical guarantees for monotonic improvement and characterizes coherence as fundamental.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of formal guarantees in existing self-improvement approaches for intelligent systems, focusing on internal consistency through coherence.

Method: Proposes projection-based mechanisms to update models coherently while minimizing deviation from original behavior, covering direct and two-step methods.

Result: Achieves monotonic improvement with theoretical guarantees, extends to non-realizable settings, and characterizes coherence as necessary.

Conclusion: Coherence is essential for provable self-improvement in language models, offering robust theoretical foundations.

Abstract: Self-improvement is a critical capability for large language models and other intelligent systems, enabling them to refine their behavior and internal consistency without external supervision. Despite its importance, prior approaches largely rely on empirical heuristics and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for self-improvement based on the concept of \emph{coherence}, which requires that a model's outputs remain consistent under task-preserving transformations of the input.
  We formalize this concept using projection-based mechanisms that update a baseline model to be coherent while remaining as close as possible to its original behavior. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \emph{direct} and \emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.
  Furthermore, we establish a general \emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure. This culminates in rigidity results under the demand for universal improvement, establishing coherence as a fundamental and, in a formal sense, necessary principle for provable self-improvement.

### [256] [One Model for All: Universal Pre-training for EEG based Emotion Recognition across Heterogeneous Datasets and Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08444)
*Xiang Li,You Li,Yazhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A universal pre-training framework ('One Model for All') improves EEG-based emotion recognition by addressing dataset heterogeneity via two-stage learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome dataset heterogeneity (channel/subject variability) in EEG-based emotion recognition and improve model generalizability across disparate datasets.

Method: Two-stage learning: (1) Univariate pre-training with self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels using UCS; (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with ART and GAT architectures for spatio-temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), DREAMER (93.93%), and superior cross-dataset transfer (94.08%). Ablation shows GAT's critical role (+22.19% gain).

Conclusion: The framework enables universal, scalable, and effective pre-trained models for diverse EEG analysis tasks.

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition is hampered by profound dataset heterogeneity (channel/subject variability), hindering generalizable models. Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop. This work paves the way for more universal, scalable, and effective pre-trained models for diverse EEG analysis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods for handling categorical features under MAE criteria in CART.

Method: Proposes a novel splitting algorithm designed specifically for categorical features using MAE.

Result: Demonstrates the shortcomings of unsupervised encoding and validates the new algorithm's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The new algorithm offers a promising solution for better handling categorical data in CART.

Abstract: In the context of the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, the efficient splitting of categorical features using standard criteria like GINI and Entropy is well-established. However, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion for categorical features has traditionally relied on various numerical encoding methods. This paper demonstrates that unsupervised numerical encoding methods are not viable for the MAE criteria. Furthermore, we present a novel and efficient splitting algorithm that addresses the challenges of handling categorical features with the MAE criterion. Our findings underscore the limitations of existing approaches and offer a promising solution to enhance the handling of categorical data in CART algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate localization of multiple transmitters in Molecular Communication via Diffusion is challenging due to diffusion's stochastic nature and overlapping molecule distributions at the receiver surface.

Abstract: Transmitter localization in Molecular Communication via Diffusion is a critical topic with many applications. However, accurate localization of multiple transmitters is a challenging problem due to the stochastic nature of diffusion and overlapping molecule distributions at the receiver surface. To address these issues, we introduce clustering-based centroid correction methods that enhance robustness against density variations, and outliers. In addition, we propose two clusteringguided Residual Neural Networks, namely AngleNN for direction refinement and SizeNN for cluster size estimation. Experimental results show that both approaches provide significant improvements with reducing localization error between 69% (2-Tx) and 43% (4-Tx) compared to the K-means.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a practical and theoretically sound framework for JEPAs, addressing the lack of guidance and ad-hoc R&D in learning manipulable representations of world dynamics.

Method: Develops LeJEPA, combining JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg, which constrains embeddings to an isotropic Gaussian distribution, optimizing prediction risk. Offers simplicity and linear complexity.

Result: Validated on 10+ datasets and 60+ architectures, achieving 79% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with ViT-H/14 and demonstrating stability across hyperparameters and domains.

Conclusion: LeJEPA's simplicity and theoretical foundation aim to redefine self-supervised pre-training as a key AI research pillar.

Abstract: Learning manipulable representations of the world and its dynamics is central to AI. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to ad-hoc R&D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\approx$50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA reaches 79\% with a ViT-H/14. We hope that the simplicity and theory-friendly ecosystem offered by LeJEPA will reestablish self-supervised pre-training as a core pillar of AI research (\href{git@github.com:rbalestr-lab/lejepa.git}{GitHub repo}).

TL;DR: A novel Mutual Information estimator using normalizing flows transforms joint and marginal distributions for efficient, precise scaling in high dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative approaches for MI estimation train classifiers, which may lack efficiency and scalability. This work aims to improve precision and computational efficiency.

Method: The method learns a normalizing flow to transform joint distributions into marginal distributions, avoiding classifier training.

Result: The technique provides computationally efficient and precise MI estimates, scaling well across high dimensions and various MI values.

Conclusion: The proposed estimator offers a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional discriminative MI estimation methods.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Mutual Information (MI) estimator that fundamentally reframes the discriminative approach. Instead of training a classifier to discriminate between joint and marginal distributions, we learn a normalizing flow that transforms one into the other. This technique produces a computationally efficient and precise MI estimate that scales well to high dimensions and across a wide range of ground-truth MI values.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR improves language model reasoning by focusing updates on specific parameter regions, guided by a Three-Gate Theory, contrasting with SFT's principal-weight approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the paradox of RLVR's sparsity and explain its optimization dynamics compared to SFT.

Method: Proposes a Three-Gate Theory to describe RLVR's update localization and validates it through parameter-level analysis.

Result: RLVR learns off principal directions with minimal spectral drift, outperforming SFT, which distorts the spectrum.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into RLVR's distinct optimization regime, advocating for RLVR-native algorithms over SFT methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) reliably improves the reasoning performance of large language models, yet it appears to modify only a small fraction of parameters. We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.
  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) improve interpretability and accuracy but require manual domain grid adjustments. AdaptKAN autonomously updates domains and matches/exceeds performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs offer benefits like interpretability and accuracy but lack autonomous domain updates, requiring user effort. AdaptKAN addresses this limitation.

Method: AdaptKAN autonomously adjusts domain grids (histogram algorithm) and is tested on tasks like learning equations, image classification, and OOD detection.

Result: AdaptKAN matches/exceeds prior KANs and MLPs on tasks including Feynman dataset, image classification, control Lyapunov functions, and OOD detection.

Conclusion: AdaptKAN improves KANs by enabling autonomous domain updates and performs competitively across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a class of neural networks that have received increased attention in recent literature. In contrast to MLPs, KANs leverage parameterized, trainable activation functions and offer several benefits including improved interpretability and higher accuracy on learning symbolic equations. However, the original KAN architecture requires adjustments to the domain discretization of the network (called the "domain grid") during training, creating extra overhead for the user in the training process. Typical KAN layers are not designed with the ability to autonomously update their domains in a data-driven manner informed by the changing output ranges of previous layers. As an added benefit, this histogram algorithm may also be applied towards detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in a variety of settings. We demonstrate that AdaptKAN exceeds or matches the performance of prior KAN architectures and MLPs on four different tasks: learning scientific equations from the Feynman dataset, image classification from frozen features, learning a control Lyapunov function, and detecting OOD inputs on the OpenOOD v1.5 benchmark.

### [263] [Climate Driven Interactions Between Malaria Transmission and Diabetes Prevalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08562)
*Shivank,Anurag Singha,Fakhteh Ghanbarnejad,Ajay K Sharma*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Climate change exacerbates malaria and diabetes, with diabetics at higher malaria risk. A new model shows diabetics have 1.8–4x higher odds of malaria infection, urging integrated climate-health strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in models that rarely consider bidirectional interactions between climate change and diseases like malaria and diabetes, especially among vulnerable populations.

Method: Introduces a compartmental epidemiological model using synthetic data from India (2019–2021), incorporating temperature-dependent transmission, seasonal variability, and disease dynamics in diabetic vs. non-diabetic groups. Calibration used Multi-Start optimization and Sequential Quadratic Programming.

Result: Diabetics had 1.8–4x higher malaria infection odds, with peak infections at 35–36% vs. 20–21% in non-diabetics. The basic reproduction number averaged 2.3 (range: 0.31–2.75).

Conclusion: With India's diabetic population projected to rise to 157 million by 2050, integrated climate-health strategies targeting malaria and diabetes are urgently needed.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying infectious and chronic diseases like malaria and diabetes, respectively, especially among the vulnerable populations. Global temperatures have risen by approximately $0.6^\circ$C since 1950, extending the window of transmission for mosquito-borne infections and worsening outcomes in diabetes due to metabolic stress caused by heat. People living with diabetes have already weakened immune defenses and, therefore, are at an alarmingly increased risk of contraction of malaria. However, most models rarely include both ways of interaction in changing climate conditions. In the paper, we introduce a new compartmental epidemiological model based on synthetic data fitted to disease patterns of India from 2019 to 2021. The framework captures temperature-dependent transmission parameters, seasonal variability, and different disease dynamics between diabetic and non-diabetic groups within the three-compartment system. Model calibration using Multi-Start optimization combined with Sequential Quadratic Programming allows us to find outstanding differences between populations. The odds of malaria infection in diabetic individuals were found to be 1.8--4.0 times higher, with peak infection levels in 35--36\%, as compared to 20--21\% in the non-diabetic ones. The fitted model was able to capture well the epidemiological patterns observed, while the basic reproduction number averaged around 2.3, ranging from 0.31 to 2.75 in different seasons. Given that India's diabetic population is set to rise to about 157 million people by 2050, these findings point to a pressing need for concerted efforts toward climate-informed health strategies and monitoring systems that address both malaria and diabetes jointly.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OASIS, a benchmark suite to evaluate LLM-driven agent safety under concealed intent and complex tasks, uncovering safety degradation and a 'Complexity Paradox.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations overlook sophisticated threats in LLM-driven agents, prompting the need for a more nuanced analysis.

Method: The authors propose OASIS, a hierarchical benchmark with annotations and a simulation sandbox, to analyze safety brittleness under intent concealment and task complexity.

Result: Results show safety alignment degrades with obscured intent and reveal a 'Complexity Paradox' where agents appear safer on harder tasks due to capability limits.

Conclusion: OASIS provides tools to improve agent safety in overlooked dimensions, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods.

Abstract: Current safety evaluations for LLM-driven agents primarily focus on atomic harms, failing to address sophisticated threats where malicious intent is concealed or diluted within complex tasks. We address this gap with a two-dimensional analysis of agent safety brittleness under the orthogonal pressures of intent concealment and task complexity. To enable this, we introduce OASIS (Orthogonal Agent Safety Inquiry Suite), a hierarchical benchmark with fine-grained annotations and a high-fidelity simulation sandbox. Our findings reveal two critical phenomena: safety alignment degrades sharply and predictably as intent becomes obscured, and a "Complexity Paradox" emerges, where agents seem safer on harder tasks only due to capability limitations. By releasing OASIS and its simulation environment, we provide a principled foundation for probing and strengthening agent safety in these overlooked dimensions.

### [265] [A Negotiation-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Dynamic Scheduling of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07707)
*Manonmani Sekar,Nasim Nezamoddini*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework using enhanced DQN agents for dynamic scheduling in reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) need flexible planning due to dynamic demands and disruptions. Current systems lack adaptability, prompting the use of MARL for real-time scheduling.

Method: The study employs MARL with enhanced DQN agents (prioritized replay, n-step returns, etc.) and an attention-based negotiation mechanism for dynamic job-machine assignments in RMS.

Result: Experiments show the approach reduces makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization, though machine breakdowns increase variability in performance metrics.

Conclusion: The MARL framework is effective for adaptive scheduling in RMS, confirming its advantages for handling dynamic and stochastic manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) are critical for future market adjustment given their rapid adaptation to fluctuations in consumer demands, the introduction of new technological advances, and disruptions in linked supply chain sections. The adjustable hard settings of such systems require a flexible soft planning mechanism that enables realtime production planning and scheduling amid the existing complexity and variability in their configuration settings. This study explores the application of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for dynamic scheduling in soft planning of the RMS settings. In the proposed framework, deep Qnetwork (DQN) agents trained in centralized training learn optimal job machine assignments in real time while adapting to stochastic events such as machine breakdowns and reconfiguration delays. The model also incorporates a negotiation with an attention mechanism to enhance state representation and improve decision focus on critical system features. Key DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, nstep returns, double DQN and soft target update are used to stabilize and accelerate learning. Experiments conducted in a simulated RMS environment demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization. The reconfigurable manufacturing environment was extended to simulate realistic challenges, including machine failures and reconfiguration times. Experimental results show that while the enhanced DQN agent is effective in adapting to dynamic conditions, machine breakdowns increase variability in key performance metrics such as makespan, throughput, and total tardiness. The results confirm the advantages of applying the MARL mechanism for intelligent and adaptive scheduling in dynamic reconfigurable manufacturing environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of LLMs and small discriminative models for Covid-19 detection in chest X-rays, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy and environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the efficiency of AI tools in medical diagnosis, particularly comparing large language models (LLMs) and small discriminative models for Covid-19 detection, while considering environmental impact.

Method: Integration of LLMs and small discriminative models into a Mendix application for Covid-19 detection in chest X-rays, benchmarking 14 model configurations for accuracy and carbon footprint.

Result: Small models reduced carbon footprint but had biased outputs and low confidence. LLMs performed poorly when restricted to probabilistic outputs. Covid-Net was the most efficient, with 99.9% lower carbon footprint than GPT-4.5-Preview and 95.5% accuracy.

Conclusion: Small discriminative models like Covid-Net offer better accuracy and environmental efficiency than LLMs for classification tasks, highlighting risks of using generative models universally.

Abstract: The integration of AI tools into medical applications has aimed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks.

### [268] [Beyond Correctness: Confidence-Aware Reward Modeling for Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07483)
*Qianxi He,Qingyu Ren,Shanzhe Lei,Xuhong Wang,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel confidence-based reward model is proposed to improve STEM reasoning in smaller-scale LLMs by penalizing low-confidence correct answers, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL methods often lead to poor reasoning quality or inconsistencies, especially in smaller models, limiting resource-limited organizations' ability to train effectively.

Method: The paper introduces a confidence-based reward model that penalizes low-confidence correct answers, validated through static evaluations, Best-of-N tests, and PPO-based RL training.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art open-source reward models across various STEM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The confidence-based reward model enhances reasoning robustness and logical consistency, making it viable for smaller-scale models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM.

TL;DR: Hierarchical task networks (HTNs) improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, outperforming larger models and showing potential for leveraging procedural knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with agentic tasks without extensive support, prompting exploration of how procedural knowledge (like HTNs) can enhance their planning efficiency.

Method: Formalizing and implementing an agentic LLM workflow using HTNs, with evaluations comparing performance improvements from hand-coded and LLM-created HTNs.

Result: Hand-coded HTNs significantly boost LLM performance, enabling smaller models (20b/70b) to outperform larger ones (120b). LLM-created HTNs also improve performance but to a lesser extent.

Conclusion: Curating procedural knowledge (via HTNs) from humans, documents, or LLMs is a promising tool for enhancing LLM workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle when performing agentic tasks without substantial tool support, prom-pt engineering, or fine tuning. Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.

### [270] [Beyond Fact Retrieval: Episodic Memory for RAG with Generative Semantic Workspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07587)
*Shreyas Rajesh,Pavan Holur,Chenda Duan,David Chong,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GSW is a neuro-inspired generative memory framework enhancing LLMs' episodic reasoning by structuring evolving situations, outperforming baselines by 20% on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-context reasoning due to finite windows and degraded performance; current solutions lack narrative tracking.

Method: GSW uses an Operator for semantic mapping and a Reconciler for coherent integration into a persistent workspace.

Result: GSW improves performance by 20% on EpBench and reduces query tokens by 51%.

Conclusion: GSW provides a scalable solution for episodic memory in LLMs, enabling long-horizon reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

*Jakub Slapek,Mir Seyedebrahimi,Yang Jianhua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel AI-enhanced tool addresses unfair team contribution assessment by analyzing heterogeneous data across Contribution, Interaction, and Role dimensions, using LLMs for transparent advisory judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent challenges in equitable team contribution assessment and the lack of conflict resolution methods and AI integration drive this work.

Method: Proposes a framework organizing diverse artifacts into three dimensions with nine benchmarks, normalized and analyzed using LLMs and inequality measures.

Result: Generates interpretable and transparent advisory judgments, supported by feasibility under current policies and practical analytics.

Conclusion: The tool offers a viable solution for fairer team assessments, though limitations and practical challenges remain.

Abstract: The equitable assessment of individual contribution in teams remains a persistent challenge, where conflict and disparity in workload can result in unfair performance evaluation, often requiring manual intervention - a costly and challenging process. We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments. We argue for feasibility under current statutory and institutional policy, and outline practical analytics (sentimental, task fidelity, word/line count, etc.), bias safeguards, limitations, and practical challenges.

*Alejandro R. Jadad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with high-stakes decisions due to cognitive biases. A 7-stage calibration framework improves human-AI partnership, preventing avoidable regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliability gap of LLMs in high-stakes strategic decisions caused by cognitive biases in humans and AI.

Method: Systematic qualitative assessment across 7 LLMs and 3 venture vignettes under time pressure, using detailed prompting and a 7-stage calibration sequence within a 5-layer protection architecture.

Result: Achieved initial partnership state but required emergent maintenance protocols. Reliability degrades under architectural drift and context exhaustion. Cross-model validation showed performance differences.

Conclusion: Human-AI teams can prevent avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions with structured calibration, addressing ROI expectations and cognitive traps.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel in verifiable domains where outputs can be checked before action but prove less reliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes. This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.
  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.
  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.
  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.

TL;DR: The AIA Forecaster, an LLM-based system combining agentic search, supervisor reconciliation, and calibration techniques, matches human superforecasters and outperforms LLM baselines. It also enhances market consensus forecasts in challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance AI forecasting by leveraging unstructured data and addressing LLM biases, achieving expert-level accuracy at scale.

Method: Integrates agentic search over news sources, a supervisor agent for forecast reconciliation, and statistical calibration techniques.

Result: Matches human superforecasters on ForecastBench and enhances market consensus forecasts in tougher benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sets a new standard in AI forecasting, offering scalable expert-level performance and practical insights for future research.

Abstract: This technical report describes the AIA Forecaster, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system for judgmental forecasting using unstructured data. The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that verifiably achieves expert-level forecasting at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ResearchRubrics is introduced as a standardized benchmark for evaluating Deep Research (DR) agents, featuring expert-written rubrics and a complexity framework. Despite state-of-the-art DR systems scoring under 68% compliance, the benchmark aims to improve robustness in assessing deep research capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in evaluating DR agents due to lengthy, diverse responses and dynamic information sources by creating a standardized benchmark.

Method: The method involves developing ResearchRubrics with 2,500+ expert-written rubrics and a complexity framework (conceptual breadth, logical nesting, exploration). Human and model-based evaluation protocols are also designed.

Result: Leading DR agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with rubrics, mainly due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for robust DR evaluation and releases ResearchRubrics to advance well-justified research assistants.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

### [275] [Towards AI-Assisted Generation of Military Training Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07690)
*Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun,Benjamin Nye,James Sterrett,Matthew Green*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent, multi-modal LLM framework to automate complex military training scenario generation, overcoming limitations of pre-LLM tools by hierarchically decomposing tasks and ensuring logical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scenario generation for military training is labor-intensive, and pre-LLM AI tools lacked complexity and adaptability. The goal is to leverage LLMs for efficient, nuanced document generation.

Method: The framework decomposes scenario generation into subproblems, assigns AI roles (option generation, candidate approval, or full automation), and uses specialized LLM agents to process text and visual inputs sequentially for consistency.

Result: A proof-of-concept successfully generates OPORD sections with map positions and movements, demonstrating feasibility, accuracy, and dynamic adaptability.

Conclusion: LLM-driven multi-agent systems show promise for automating coherent, adaptable military training scenarios, advancing efficiency beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Achieving expert-level performance in simulation-based training relies on the creation of complex, adaptable scenarios, a traditionally laborious and resource intensive process. Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.

### [276] [Alignment-Aware Quantization for LLM Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07842)
*Sunghyun Wee,Suyoung Kim,Hyeonjin Kim,Kyomin Hwang,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Alignment-Aware Quantization (AAQ), a method integrating Alignment-Preserving Contrastive loss into post-training quantization to maintain safety alignment without specialized datasets, enabling efficient 4-bit quantization while preserving safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety and efficiency are conflicting goals in LLMs. Conventional PTQ focuses on low perplexity, risking safety degradation, highlighting the need for a method balancing both.

Method: AAQ uses Alignment-Preserving Contrastive loss to preserve alignment by mimicking safe, instruction-tuned models and diverging from unaligned pre-trained ones, compatible with standard PTQ techniques.

Result: AAQ enables robust 4-bit quantization (W4A4) across models like LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral, maintaining safety where traditional methods fail.

Conclusion: AAQ resolves the safety-efficiency trade-off, offering a practical solution for deploying efficient and trustworthy LLMs.

Abstract: Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy.

TL;DR: GAMA introduces a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention for VRPs, outperforming recent baselines by leveraging structured state representations and gated fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for VRPs often use simplistic state representations and naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich context.

Method: GAMA uses graph neural networks to encode problem instances and solutions as distinct modalities, modeling interactions via self- and cross-attention layers, and integrates them with gated fusion.

Result: GAMA outperforms recent neural baselines in extensive experiments on synthetic and benchmark VRP instances.

Conclusion: The multi-modal attention mechanism and gated fusion are key to GAMA's performance gains, demonstrating the importance of structured state representations in VRPs.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural neighborhood search methods have shown potential in tackling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.

### [278] [WaterMod: Modular Token-Rank Partitioning for Probability-Balanced LLM Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07863)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WaterMod introduces a probability-aware modular rule for watermarking large language models, balancing fluency and provenance by distributing semantically similar tokens across classes and applying small biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional logit-based watermarks, which can exclude high-probability tokens and degrade fluency, while meeting regulatory requirements for synthetic content provenance.

Method: Sorts vocabulary by probability, partitions ranks mod k, and applies biases to selected classes. Uses entropy-adaptive gating for zero-bit and payload digits for multi-bit settings.

Result: Demonstrates strong watermark detection and maintained generation quality across tasks like natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

Conclusion: WaterMod effectively combines binary attribution and rich payload capabilities without compromising fluency, proving robust across diverse applications.

Abstract: Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/WaterMod.

TL;DR: A confidence-aware decoding framework for non-invasive brain-computer interfaces improves accuracy and trustworthiness by using deep ensembles, uncertainty quantification, and selective classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability and deployment-readiness of brain-computer interfaces decoding spoken commands from EEG signals.

Method: Combines deep ensembles of compact convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification, using predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Outperforms baselines with more reliable probability estimates, better selective performance, and balanced per-class acceptance.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware neural decoding offers robust behavior suitable for real-world brain-computer interface systems.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that decode spoken commands from electroencephalogram must be both accurate and trustworthy. We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity. Compared with widely used baselines, the proposed method yields more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance. These results suggest that confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

TL;DR: The study explores EEG-based communication support for aphasia patients, identifying neural patterns for correct and misarticulated speech and developing a model that improves decoding accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of EEG-based systems tailored for aphasic patients, the study aims to decode speech intentions despite articulation errors.

Method: EEG signals were recorded during a Korean speech task, analyzed spectrally, and used to train a multitask learning model with delta features.

Result: The model achieved 58.6% accuracy for correct trials and 45.5% for misarticulated trials, outperforming baselines by 45%.

Conclusion: EEG-based assistive systems are feasible for supporting aphasia patients in real-world speech conditions.

Abstract: Aphasia severely limits verbal communication due to impaired language production, often leading to frequent misarticulations during speech attempts. Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.

TL;DR: SparseRM uses Sparse Autoencoder to create a lightweight, interpretable reward model for LLMs, outperforming traditional RMs with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training reliable reward models under limited resources is challenging due to reliance on large-scale annotations and high fine-tuning costs.

Method: SparseRM employs Sparse Autoencoder to decompose LLM representations into interpretable preference-relevant features, projecting them to compute alignment scores aggregated by a reward head.

Result: SparseRM outperforms mainstream RMs on three preference tasks using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: SparseRM offers an efficient, interpretable solution for LLM alignment, seamlessly integrating into downstream pipelines.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding deep learning models remains challenging; this work aims to explain data through human-understandable language, leveraging large language models and external knowledge.

Method: A pipeline generates textual descriptions using large language models and knowledge bases, refined via influence estimation and CLIP scores. A benchmark task evaluates cross-modal transferability.

Result: Textual descriptions outperformed baselines in zero-shot settings and improved image classification performance across nine datasets, validated by GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The approach enhances model interpretability and performance, demonstrating the potential of textual descriptions in understanding deep learning models.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

TL;DR: DANS-KGC introduces a diffusion-based adaptive negative sampling method for knowledge graph completion, overcoming limitations like false negatives and lack of hardness control, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing negative sampling strategies suffer from issues like false negatives, limited generalization, and uncontrolled sample hardness.

Method: DANS-KGC uses Difficulty Assessment Module, Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (with diffusion model), and Dynamic Training Mechanism for adaptive sampling and curriculum-style learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets across all three evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: DANS-KGC effectively addresses limitations of traditional negative sampling, demonstrating strong generalization and performance.

Abstract: Negative sampling (NS) strategies play a crucial role in knowledge graph representation. In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores neural dynamics behind human adaptive reasoning using EEG and compares it to a multimodal LLM, revealing distinct delta-theta-alpha oscillations in humans absent in the LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning in humans and compare them with artificial models like LLMs.

Method: Used a card-sorting paradigm with EEG to analyze neural activity and compared human performance with a multimodal LLM.

Result: Humans showed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics for exploration and rule stabilization, while the LLM lacked hierarchical rule abstraction.

Conclusion: Hierarchical neural oscillations distinguish human adaptive reasoning, suggesting brain-inspired AI needs oscillatory feedback coordination.

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning enables humans to flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules or contexts change, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates feasibility for clinical deployment, offering reliable performance under practical constraints.

Abstract: A diffusion-based neural decoding framework optimized for real-time imagined speech classification in individuals with aphasia. The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1). These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, maintaining reliable performance despite environmental variability and minimal preprocessing. The proposed framework advances the translation of imagined speech brain-computer interfaces toward clinical communication support for individuals with severe expressive language impairment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the demand for personalized math education by generating large sets of similar practice problems efficiently.

Method: Defines IMPG, explores LLM-based frameworks, and establishes CBIT with meta-level generation and template-based variations.

Result: CBIT achieves high correctness and consistency, reduces costs, and has a 17.8% lower error rate than expert-authored problems.

Conclusion: CBIT is effective for scalable, accurate math problem generation, benefiting personalized education.

Abstract: Personalized mathematics education is growing rapidly, creating a strong demand for large sets of similar practice problems. Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale. Most importantly, CBIT-generated problems exhibited an error rate 17.8% lower than expert-authored items, with deployment to 6,732 learners on a commercial education platform yielding 186,870 interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinker is a hierarchical thinking model decomposing complex problems into solvable sub-problems with dual representations (natural language and logical functions) to enhance reasoning coherence and avoid unnecessary searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable while addressing limitations of end-to-end reinforcement learning approaches.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition into sub-problems with dual representations, knowledge boundary determination, and multi-turn interaction for deep search.

Result: Competitive performance with few training samples; outperforms baselines when scaled.

Conclusion: Thinker improves reasoning coherence and avoids unnecessary searches, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

TL;DR: TimeFlow introduces an SDE-based flow matching framework using an encoder-only architecture to efficiently generate high-quality, diverse time series data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to model stochasticity in temporal dynamics for high-quality time series generation, addressing the inefficiency of diffusion models and the limitations of ODE-based flow matching.

Method: Develops TimeFlow with a component-wise decomposed velocity field and stochastic term augmentation for enhanced expressiveness, supporting unconditional and conditional generation.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: TimeFlow is a flexible and general solution for time series generation, effectively capturing stochasticity and improving upon existing paradigms.

Abstract: Generating high-quality time series data has emerged as a critical research topic due to its broad utility in supporting downstream time series mining tasks. A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.

TL;DR: VARS introduces a graph-based approach to uniformly model diverse ECG signals, improving versatility and risk signal detection while surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations in ECG signal diagnosis, such as lack of versatility in processing diverse configurations and inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances.

Method: VARS transforms ECG signals into graph structures capturing diagnostic features, integrating denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw data and highlight patterns.

Result: VARS outperforms state-of-the-art models across datasets, improves risk signal identification, and provides interpretability by pinpointing relevant waveforms.

Conclusion: VARS shows promise as a versatile and effective tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal diagnosis and analysis methods through deep learning, two major hurdles still limit their clinical adoption: the lack of versatility in processing ECG signals with diverse configurations, and the inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances. Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework enhances interpretability by addressing misclassification issues with object- and part-level details, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attribution-based explanations lack granularity for fine-grained tasks, especially in misclassification scenarios, prompting the need for more detailed insights.

Method: The proposed framework generates non-generative counterfactual explanations by quantifying similarity and weighting contributions between correctly classified and misclassified samples, using a saliency partition module based on Shapley values.

Result: The approach captures more granular and meaningful regions, surpassing existing fine-grained methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses fine-grained interpretability challenges, providing detailed explanations for model misclassifications.

Abstract: Attribution-based explanation techniques capture key patterns to enhance visual interpretability; however, these patterns often lack the granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks, particularly in cases of model misclassification, where explanations may be insufficiently detailed. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions, surpassing fine-grained methods.

Result: LLMs perform moderately on MSLR. Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts outperform human-designed ones in improving reasoning coherence and quality.

Conclusion: MSLR advances LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies while providing open resources for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic forecasting is complex due to intertwined spatial-temporal dependencies, which prior methods fail to address jointly.

Method: ST-SAM uses region embeddings and a self-attention-based module to learn spatial-temporal dependencies for nearby and faraway regions.

Result: ST-SAM improves accuracy (15% RMSE, 17% MAPE) and efficiency (32x faster training) compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ST-SAM effectively captures spatial-temporal dependencies, offering superior performance and efficiency in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).

Abstract: Recent studies on audio models show brain-tuning - fine-tuning models to better predict corresponding fMRI activity - improves brain alignment and increases performance on downstream semantic and audio tasks. We extend this approach to a multimodal audio-video model to enhance social cognition, targeting the Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS), a key region for social processing, while subjects watch Friends.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually crafting CQs is time-consuming, and existing methods fail to detect semantic pitfalls like Misusing allValuesFrom. Automated solutions are needed to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The authors fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate semantic discrepancies introduced by misaligning natural language definitions and ontology axioms.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation.

Conclusion: This study enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, reducing manual effort and improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge.

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) play a crucial role in validating ontology design. While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as "Misusing allValuesFrom". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN studies lack focus on logical rule expression in KGs, prompting the need for enhanced expressive power.

Method: PN-GNN aggregates node-neighbor embeddings on reasoning paths and analyzes its logical expressive power theoretically and experimentally.

Result: PN-GNN shows stronger expressive power than C-GNN and competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PN-GNN effectively enhances logical rule expression without compromising generalization, validated by theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-view multi-label feature selection method combining LLMs for semantic reasoning and GNNs for structural modeling, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing MVMLFS methods by incorporating both statistical and semantic information for better feature selection.

Method: Uses LLMs to assess semantic relevance, constructs a semantic-aware heterogeneous graph, and applies a lightweight GAT for feature ranking.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets and shows robustness on small-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The method is robust, flexible, and generalizes well, offering improved feature selection in high-dimensional, multimodal contexts.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

*Zhishen Sun,Guang Dai,Ivor Tsang,Haishan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new perturbation framework tests LLMs' mathematical reasoning under increasing irrelevant perturbations, revealing sensitivity to numerical noise and reliance on memory templates rather than logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs truly understand mathematics by evaluating their robustness against perturbations and missing instructions.

Method: Inject semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences (with and without numbers) and remove core questioning instructions, measuring performance decline.

Result: LLMs are sensitive to numerical perturbations, with performance dropping significantly (up to 51.55%). Even top models decline by 3%-10%. Models maintain 20%-40% accuracy without core instructions, suggesting reliance on memory templates.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in reasoning robustness and may depend on pattern matching, highlighting areas for improvement in future development.

Abstract: LLMs have made significant progress in the field of mathematical reasoning, but whether they have true the mathematical understanding ability is still controversial. To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.

It combines knowledge graph traversal with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex multi-hop tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with logical inconsistencies and lack of domain knowledge grounding in biomolecular reasoning, leading to flawed reasoning steps and dependency issues.

Method: The framework integrates LLMs with knowledge graphs via multi-hop reasoning chains, guided traversal, pruning, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

Result: The method outperforms larger models on complex multi-hop tasks, demonstrating superior reasoning depth and consistency.

Conclusion: Combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies enhances reliability and interpretability in biomolecular reasoning, as validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding complex biomolecular mechanisms requires multi-step reasoning across molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.

### [301] [Towards a Standard, Enterprise-Relevant Agentic AI Benchmark: Lessons from 5.5 billion tokens' worth of agentic AI evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08042)
*JV Roig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAMI v0.1, a benchmark for evaluating agentic AI systems in enterprise settings, highlighting shortcomings of traditional benchmarks and providing insights on model performance and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise adoption of agentic AI systems lacks reliable evaluation methods that mimic real-world scenarios, as traditional benchmarks are flawed due to training data contamination and inability to assess agentic capabilities.

Method: The authors developed KAMI v0.1, testing 170,000 LLM items across 35 model configurations, processing 5.5 billion tokens to evaluate contamination resistance and agentic performance.

Result: Traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance; newer models don't always outperform older ones in enterprise tasks, and insights on cost-performance and token efficiency were uncovered.

Conclusion: KAMI v0.1 offers a more accurate evaluation tool for enterprises, revealing critical performance patterns and tradeoffs for deploying agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Enterprise adoption of agentic AI systems requires reliable evaluation methods that reflect real-world deployment scenarios. Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities such as multi-step tool use and decision-making under uncertainty. We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends. We also present insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and the impact of reasoning capabilities on token efficiency -- findings critical for enterprises making deployment decisions.

*Po-Chung Hsieh,Chin-Po Chen,Jeng-Lin Li,Ming-Ching Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, inspired by psychological theories, achieving high accuracy and efficiency while aligning with human cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the gap in exploring System 2 reasoning in LLMs and aims to optimize cognitive pathways for code debugging.

Method: Proposes a Scaffold Reasoning framework with three streams: Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream, integrating reference code and bug analysis.

Result: Achieves an 88.91% pass rate and 5.36s average inference time on DebugBench, outperforming other approaches in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework aligns with human cognitive processes and demonstrates advantages across problem difficulties and bug types, though limitations exist.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

*Cheng Yuan,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'information capacity' as a unified metric to evaluate LLM efficiency, considering computational complexity and compression performance, while also accounting for tokenizer efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified metric for assessing LLM efficiency across different sizes and architectures motivates the introduction of information capacity.

Method: The proposed metric uses text compression performance relative to computational complexity, tested empirically on 49 models across 5 datasets.

Result: Models within a series show consistent information capacity, and the metric effectively compares efficiency across series and predicts performance.

Conclusion: Information capacity is a robust metric that includes tokenizer efficiency and provides fair comparisons across LLMs.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

*Jinbo Li,Hesam Izakian,Witold Pedrycz,Iqbal Jamal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a clustering-based method for detecting anomalies in multivariate time series by analyzing amplitude and shape patterns using fuzzy clustering and reconstruction criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is complex due to temporal and variable relationships, but it has wide applications in fields like healthcare, finance, and weather analysis.

Method: The proposed approach uses sliding windows to generate subsequences, applies extended fuzzy clustering, and employs reconstruction criteria with Particle Swarm Optimization for anomaly detection.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the method's effectiveness in detecting anomalies in multivariate time series.

Conclusion: The framework successfully identifies anomalous amplitude and shape patterns, making it applicable across diverse domains.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

*Stella C. Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called RAIRAB to assess the reliability of LLMs in reinsurance, based on a five-pillar architecture that aligns with regulatory standards. It shows improved grounding accuracy and transparency, reducing hallucinations and drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to translate supervisory expectations into measurable controls for LLM reliability in reinsurance, addressing challenges like grounding, transparency, and accountability.

Method: The method involves a five-pillar architecture (governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, regulatory alignment) and implements RAIRAB to evaluate LLMs against prudential standards.

Result: Retrieval-grounded LLMs achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by ~40%, and nearly doubled transparency.

Conclusion: Existing prudential doctrines can support reliable AI when governance, data traceability, and verifiable assurance are explicitly addressed.

Abstract: This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

TL;DR: The paper explores tractable solutions for Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) satisfiability problems using parameterized complexity, introducing fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for probabilistic and counterfactual fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational intractability of PCH satisfiability problems by leveraging parameterized complexity.

Method: The authors use parameters like primal treewidth and variable count, departing from dynamic programming to exploit structural characterizations of causal models.

Result: They achieve fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for key PCH fragments, supported by hardness results defining tractability limits.

Conclusion: The study provides a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning, advancing the field beyond traditional dynamic programming approaches.

Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.

*Georg Rottenwalter,Marcel Tilly,Victor Owolabi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve interpretability and efficiency in machine learning models for industrial quality control, showing that feature reduction maintains accuracy while boosting speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial machine learning models face challenges like lack of interpretability and incomplete data due to limited sensors. XAI can address these issues by clarifying model decisions and identifying key features.

Method: Applied SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in an LSTM model trained on real production data. Reduced features from 19 to 9 and 6, assessing accuracy, speed, and interpretability.

Result: Feature reduction improved generalization and inference speed without significantly compromising classification performance.

Conclusion: XAI-driven feature reduction enhances AI feasibility for quality control in industrial settings with limited sensors, promoting efficient and interpretable machine learning in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning is an essential tool for optimizing industrial quality control processes. However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.

TL;DR: Using synthetic data alongside real data improves machine learning models for injection molding, balancing costs and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of costly and time-consuming data acquisition in industrial machine learning applications.

Method: Generating synthetic data through simulated production cycles and integrating it with real data in a Long Short-Term Memory model.

Result: Synthetic data enhances model robustness, reducing manual labor, machine use, and material waste.

Conclusion: Synthetic data offers a practical solution for industries facing data scarcity, improving manufacturing efficiency.

Abstract: Machine learning has significant potential for optimizing various industrial processes. However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.

TL;DR: SpeechCARE introduces a multimodal pipeline using transformer models for early ADRD detection via speech analysis, achieving high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-processing methods for ADRD detection lack performance and generalizability. SpeechCARE aims to overcome these with advanced multimodal analysis.

Method: Combines multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models with dynamic fusion and preprocessing (e.g., transcription, LLM anomaly detection). Includes SHAP-based explainability and bias mitigation.

Result: Achieved AUC=0.88 and F1=0.72 for classifying cognitive states (healthy, MCI, AD), with AUC=0.90 for MCI detection. Bias was minimal except for adults over 80.

Conclusion: SpeechCARE shows promise for real-world ADRD detection and plans deployment in care settings and EHR integration for underrepresented populations.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between narrow AI systems and generalistic scientific reasoning by creating adaptable, cross-disciplinary AI.

Method: SciAgent uses a hierarchical approach with a Coordinator Agent orchestrating specialized Worker Systems (symbolic, conceptual, numerical, verification) to tailor reasoning pipelines.

Result: SciAgent matches or exceeds human gold-medalist performance in Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO) and shows generalization in IChO and HLE benchmarks.

Conclusion: SciAgent represents progress toward generalistic scientific intelligence, showcasing adaptability and expert-level reasoning across disciplines.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

Result: Models trained with filtered data and lightweight strategies match or surpass larger baselines on ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl benchmarks.

Conclusion: Principled data curation and robust adaptation rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet effective multimodal reasoning agents.

Abstract: Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought- augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to create unlearnable examples by maximizing Bayes error, ensuring data privacy even when mixed with clean samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns in machine learning where user data is often used without consent, the paper seeks a more formal and effective way to prevent models from learning sensitive data.

Method: The authors introduce an optimization-based approach using projected gradient ascent to systematically maximize Bayes error, ensuring unlearnability even in mixed datasets.

Result: Experimental results confirm the method’s effectiveness across various datasets and models, proving it restricts data learnability reliably.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust and theoretically grounded solution for creating unlearnable examples, enhancing privacy protection in ML.

Abstract: The recent success of machine learning models, especially large-scale classifiers and language models, relies heavily on training with massive data. These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.

Result: The study reveals high demands on LLMs' understanding and reasoning for EHR tasks, with EHRMaster achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: EHRStruct fills a gap in evaluating LLMs for EHR tasks, and EHRMaster offers a practical solution for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data stores patient information in relational tables and plays a central role in clinical decision-making. Recent advances have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to process such data, showing promise across various clinical tasks.However, the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks and clearly defined tasks makes it difficult to systematically assess and compare LLM performance on structured EHR data.To address these evaluation challenges, we introduce EHRStruct, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on structured EHR tasks.EHRStruct defines 11 representative tasks spanning diverse clinical needs and includes 2,200 task-specific evaluation samples derived from two widely used EHR datasets.We use EHRStruct to evaluate 20 advanced and representative LLMs, covering both general and medical models.We further analyze key factors influencing model performance, including input formats, few-shot generalisation, and finetuning strategies, and compare results with 11 state-of-the-art LLM-based enhancement methods for structured data reasoning. Our results indicate that many structured EHR tasks place high demands on the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.In response, we propose EHRMaster, a code-augmented method that achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers practical

Abstract: Gaussian policies have dominated continuous control in deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet they suffer from a fundamental mismatch: their unbounded support requires ad-hoc squashing functions that distort the geometry of bounded action spaces. While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \(2d\) to \(d+1\), and avoids the \(O(dk)\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \(O(d)\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \textbf{spherical normalization} and \textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

*Waseem AlShikh,Muayad Sayed Ali,Brian Kennedy,Dmytro Mozolevskyi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework of eleven outcome-based metrics for evaluating AI agents, focusing on decision quality, autonomy, adaptability, and business value. It tests these metrics across diverse domains and agent architectures, identifying the Hybrid Agent as the top performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current infrastructural metrics for AI agents are insufficient as they miss key aspects like decision quality and business impact. A comprehensive evaluation framework is needed.

Method: The proposed framework includes metrics like Goal Completion Rate and Autonomy Index. It was tested via simulated experiments across five domains with four agent architectures.

Result: The Hybrid Agent performed best, achieving an 88.8% Goal Completion Rate and highest ROI, showing significant trade-offs between agent designs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a standardized methodology for holistic AI agent evaluation, aiding in development, deployment, and governance.

Abstract: As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.

*Ziyu Ma,Chenhui Gou,Yiming Hu,Yong Wang,Xiangxiang Chu,Bohan Zhuang,Jianfei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STV improves many-shot in-context learning in Large Multimodal Models by identifying sensitive locations for task vector insertion and using reinforcement learning for optimal insertion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task-vector-based methods struggle with determining where and what to insert, limiting the scalability of Large Multimodal Models in many-shot settings.

Method: Proposes Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion (STV), leveraging activation deltas and reinforcement learning to identify and insert task vectors effectively.

Result: STV demonstrates consistent improvements across various multimodal models and tasks, outperforming prior task-vector-based methods.

Conclusion: STV provides a robust solution for scalable many-shot in-context learning in multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but scaling to many-shot settings remains difficult due to limited context length and high inference cost. To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a system leveraging Labeled Property Graphs (LPGs) and Cypher queries for scalable reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, filling a gap in existing GraphRAG research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GraphRAG methods primarily use RDF knowledge graphs, leaving the potential of LPGs and Cypher queries underexplored. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes a modular LLM agentic system for generating and executing Cypher queries on LPGs, featuring iterative semantic and syntactic refinement via feedback loops.

Result: Evaluated on CypherBench and IFC-derived property graphs, showing effectiveness in diverse domains and real-world industrial applications like digital twins.

Conclusion: The system bridges AI with scalable industrial automation, demonstrating the promise of LPGs and Cypher in GraphRAG pipelines.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM tools are text-only, limiting usability in visual domains like mathematics. Addressing scalable evaluation of diagrams is crucial for broader adoption.

Method: DiagramIR uses intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code to evaluate geometric figures automatically and scalably.

Result: DiagramIR achieves higher agreement with human raters than baselines and allows smaller models (e.g., GPT-4.1-Mini) to match larger models (e.g., GPT-5) at lower cost.

Conclusion: DiagramIR provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for evaluating educational diagrams, enhancing accessibility and deployment of LLM-based tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as tools for learning; however, most tools remain text-only, limiting their usefulness for domains where visualizations are essential, such as mathematics. Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters. This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.

TL;DR: Spark is a shared agentic memory architecture that helps AI coding agents learn collectively, improving code quality and matching larger models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to agent-centric development reduces human collaboration, leaving AI agents without shared learning repositories. Spark fills this gap.

Method: Introduces Spark, a shared memory architecture for AI agents to contribute and learn from collective experiences, evaluated as a coaching tool.

Result: Spark improved code quality across models, with a smaller model matching a larger one's performance. Recommendations scored up to 98.2% helpfulness.

Conclusion: Spark effectively emulates human collective intelligence for AI agents, enhancing learning and code quality in agent-centric development.

Abstract: The transition from human-centric to agent-centric software development practices is disrupting existing knowledge sharing environments for software developers. Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.
  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce manual effort in data analysis and visualization by leveraging AI to automate processes like cleaning, feature selection, and visualization generation.

Method: Uses Python Flask for backend, React for frontend, and Firebase Cloud Storage. Implements ML algorithms for data cleaning, feature selection, and visualization.

Result: Successfully processes datasets up to 100,000 rows in real-time, reduces manual input, and maintains high-quality visual outputs.

Conclusion: The platform effectively automates data analysis and visualization, improving efficiency and user experience.

Abstract: An AI-powered data visualization platform that automates the entire data analysis process, from uploading a dataset to generating an interactive visualization. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously. In conclusion, the cloud-based data visualization application allowed for a significant reduction of manual inputs to the data analysis process while maintaining a high quality, impactful visual outputs, and user experiences

*Giorgio Piras,Raffaele Mura,Fabio Brau,Luca Oneto,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions in language models, outperforming single-direction baselines and jailbreak algorithms in suppressing harmful responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging evidence suggests that refusal behavior in language models is encoded as a low-dimensional manifold, prompting the need for a more nuanced approach than single-direction methods.

Method: The authors use SOMs to identify multiple refusal directions by training on harmful prompt representations and subtracting harmless centroids, validating the approach experimentally.

Result: Ablating multiple directions suppresses refusal more effectively than single-direction baselines and specialized jailbreak algorithms.

Conclusion: The study highlights the mechanistic advantages of using SOMs for refusal behavior analysis and underscores the effectiveness of multi-directional approaches.

Abstract: Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of unfaithfulness in LLMs, where reasoning chains often diverge from evidence or conclusions, ensuring alignment between reasoning and input/output.

Method: Introduces FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness and proposes FaithAct, a framework enforcing evidential grounding at each reasoning step.

Result: FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to baselines, showing more stable reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: Treating faithfulness as a guiding principle mitigates hallucination and stabilizes reasoning, establishing a unified framework for evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

*Huzaifa Arif,Keerthiram Murugesan,Ching-Yun Ko,Pin-Yu Chen,Payel Das,Alex Gittens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes lightweight "patches" for large language models (LLMs) to address safety vulnerabilities efficiently, similar to software updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Major LLM updates are costly and infrequent, making it hard to fix safety gaps quickly.

Method: Learns a compact prefix (patch) to prepend to existing models, adding minimal parameters.

Result: Patches improve safety in toxicity, bias, and harmfulness domains, matching next-gen models' safety while preserving fluency.

Conclusion: LLMs can be patched like software, providing scalable and efficient safety updates between major releases.

Abstract: We propose patching for large language models (LLMs) like software versions, a lightweight and modular approach for addressing safety vulnerabilities. While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This "patch" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be "patched" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases.

TL;DR: The paper explores how well LLMs align with human judgments on the interestingness and difficulty of math problems, finding partial agreement but notable gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how AI systems like LLMs perceive mathematical interestingness compared to humans is crucial for their collaboration in math research and education.

Method: Two empirical studies were conducted, comparing human and LLM assessments of math problem interestingness and difficulty across crowdsourced participants and Olympiad competitors.

Result: LLMs broadly agree with human notions of interestingness but poorly match human judgment distributions and rationales.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show promise but significant limitations in aligning with human assessments of mathematical interestingness.

Abstract: The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

Result: The SNN-HDC model achieves better classification accuracy, lower latency, and reduced energy consumption (1.24x to 3.67x reductions) on datasets like DvsGesture and SL-Animals-DVS. It also identifies untrained classes with 100% accuracy.

Conclusion: The SNN-HDC decoding method is a promising alternative to traditional rate and latency decoding, offering significant performance and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: This work presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) decoding method, combining SNNs with Hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The goal is to create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage. Compared to analogous architectures decoded with existing approaches, the presented SNN-HDC model attains generally better classification accuracy, lower classification latency and lower estimated energy consumption on multiple test cases from literature. The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset. The presented decoding method can also efficiently identify unknown classes it has not been trained on. In the DvsGesture dataset the SNN-HDC model can identify 100% of samples from an unseen/untrained class. Given the numerous benefits shown and discussed in this paper, this decoding method represents a very compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic AI combines neural and symbolic methods for better accuracy and interpretability, but scalability issues limit usability. DPrL addresses this.

Method: DPrL parameterizes derivation steps with neural networks and links resolution processes to Markov Decision Processes for efficient inference and learning.

Result: DPrL outperforms existing Neurosymbolic systems, achieving better scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases.

Conclusion: DPrL advances Neurosymbolic AI by overcoming scalability limitations, enabling larger and more complex applications.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys the evolution of video foundation models, highlighting their shift from generating clips to simulating interactive, physically plausible environments. It conceptualizes these models as combining implicit world models and video renderers, tracing four generations of development and discussing applications and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in advancing video generation beyond visual appeal to create models that simulate interactive, physically consistent environments, serving as implicit world models for diverse applications like robotics and gaming.

Method: The paper systematically reviews the progression of video foundation models, breaking them into four generations. It defines each generation's characteristics, showcases key works, and explores their use in domains like autonomous driving and robotics.

Result: The survey culminates in modern video foundation models that integrate implicit world models (for simulation) and video renderers (for visualization), achieving physical plausibility, interaction, and planning across scales.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by discussing open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, emphasizing agent intelligence's role in shaping and evaluating these systems.

Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.
