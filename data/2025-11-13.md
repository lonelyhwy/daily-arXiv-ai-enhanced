Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a Generative AI solution by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA to automate digitization of SNAM's gas plants using OCR, Vision LLM, and relational reasoning, achieving high accuracy in data extraction and topology identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline the digitization of gas plants by automating information extraction from P&ID documents, overcoming challenges posed by data variety and lack of standardization.

Method: The solution employs OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning, and optimization algorithms. A new Transformer architecture enhances Scene Graph Generation for analyzing complex component relations.

Result: Achieved 91% accuracy in textual data extraction, 93% component identification, and around 80% accuracy in hierarchical structure extraction.

Conclusion: The synergistic use of advanced AI technologies effectively automates plant digitization, demonstrating high accuracy and potential for broader application.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [2] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to detect and quantify 'lip leakage' in inpainting-based talking face generation, proposing a systematic evaluation framework with three test setups and new metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the undetectable 'lip leakage' issue where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than the driving audio, affecting consistency.

Method: Uses silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis, along with derived metrics like lip-sync discrepancy.

Result: Provides a model-agnostic framework to analyze and quantify lip leakage, improving reliability for future research.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology offers a robust benchmark for evaluating talking face generation models, addressing lip leakage effectively.

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [3] [A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615)
*Kosta Dakic,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Rodrigo N. Calheiros,Teng Joon Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATRIX introduces a dataset and framework for multi-drone pedestrian tracking in complex environments, outperforming static methods with robust accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in dynamic drone-based surveillance, such as occlusions and changing camera positions, lacking in existing datasets and methods.

Method: Uses synchronized footage from eight drones, real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in BEV representation.

Result: Maintains ~90% detection and tracking accuracy in complex conditions, outperforming static methods, and shows strong generalization via transfer learning.

Conclusion: MATRIX and its framework advance dynamic multi-view surveillance benchmarks, ensuring robustness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

### [4] [Learning Topology-Driven Multi-Subspace Fusion for Grassmannian Deep Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08628)
*Xuan Yu,Tianyang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework on the Grassmannian manifold, addressing limitations of static single-subspace methods. It dynamically selects subspaces and optimizes their fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches on Grassmannian manifolds often use static single-subspace representations, missing dynamic interactions between subspaces crucial for complex geometric structures.

Method: The framework includes adaptive multi-subspace modeling via topological convergence analysis and Fréchet mean optimization for subspace fusion. It also incorporates Riemannian batch normalization and mutual information regularization.

Result: The method shows superior performance in 3D action recognition, EEG classification, and graph tasks, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The work advances geometric deep learning by adapting multi-channel interaction principles to non-Euclidean domains, improving discriminability and interpretability.

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

### [5] [Time-to-Move: Training-Free Motion Controlled Video Generation via Dual-Clock Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08633)
*Assaf Singer,Noam Rotstein,Amir Mann,Ron Kimmel,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM is a training-free framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation using crude reference animations, achieving strong alignment in motion-specified regions without additional training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precise motion control and require costly fine-tuning. TTM aims to address this by leveraging user-friendly manipulations for motion cues.

Method: TTM uses crude reference animations as motion cues, preserves appearance with image conditioning, and employs dual-clock denoising for region-dependent alignment.

Result: TTM matches or exceeds training-based baselines in realism and motion control, offering precise appearance control beyond text prompts.

Conclusion: TTM provides a lightweight, plug-and-play solution for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation, compatible with any backbone model.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [6] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) framework uses a unified memory bank for all tasks, improving flexibility and scalability while maintaining high detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD methods require task-specific sub-memory banks, limiting flexibility and scalability. The proposed framework addresses this by sharing a unified memory bank across tasks.

Method: The framework incrementally updates embeddings in a fixed-size coreset during training and computes anomaly scores via nearest-neighbor matching in inference.

Result: Achieves AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa), with 100% accuracy on a real-world electronic paper dataset.

Conclusion: The unified memory bank approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating robustness in practical scenarios, and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

### [7] [Predict and Resist: Long-Term Accident Anticipation under Sensor Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08640)
*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework integrates diffusion-based denoising and time-aware actor-critic models for accident anticipation in autonomous driving, improving accuracy and reliability under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like noisy inputs and timely yet reliable predictions in accident anticipation for safer autonomous driving.

Method: Combines diffusion-based denoising for noise-resilient feature reconstruction with a time-aware actor-critic model for optimal alert timing.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D), improved mean time-to-accident, and robust performance under noise.

Conclusion: The framework enables earlier, stable, and human-aligned predictions, proving potential for real-world safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [8] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-Net improves DSGG by scoring object pair importance using spatial and temporal context, enhancing relation prediction without changing model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DSGG methods lack guidance for non-related object pairs, making it hard to identify meaningful relations during inference.

Method: RS-Net uses a spatial context encoder and temporal encoder to score object pair importance, integrating scores into triplet scoring for better predictions.

Result: RS-Net improves Recall and Precision on Action Genome, especially in mean Recall, while maintaining competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: RS-Net effectively addresses DSGG challenges, outperforming state-of-the-art methods despite added parameters.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) removes private info from video features while maintaining utility, reducing privacy leakage by 35%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy methods require retraining and are task-specific; AAM addresses this by operating in latent space for flexible use.

Method: AAM uses clip-level self-supervised privacy, co-training, and latent consistency objectives to anonymize features without retraining.

Result: 35% reduction in privacy leakage with near-baseline utility across tasks like action recognition and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: AAM effectively balances privacy and utility, mitigates biases, and is adaptable to various video tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

### [10] [Rethinking generative image pretraining: How far are we from scaling up next-pixel prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08704)
*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction for unified vision models, revealing task-dependent optimal scaling strategies and identifying compute as the primary bottleneck over data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction and its application across vision tasks like classification and generation.

Method: Training Transformers at 32x32 resolutions with IsoFlops profiles, evaluating next-pixel prediction, ImageNet accuracy, and generation quality via Fr'echet Distance.

Result: Optimal scaling varies by task; generation requires faster data growth than classification. Higher resolutions demand faster model size growth, with compute being the main bottleneck.

Conclusion: Compute is the limiting factor, and current trends suggest pixel-by-pixel image modeling could be feasible within five years.

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

### [11] [Harnessing Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Images for Fair Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08711)
*Abhipsa Basu,Aviral Gupta,Abhijnya Bhat,R. Venkatesh Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining diffusion-finetuning techniques to generate balanced training data improves classification fairness amidst dataset biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inherited biases in image classification systems due to uneven group representation in training data.

Method: Use LoRA and DreamBooth for diffusion-finetuning, clustering images within groups, and training DreamBooth models per cluster to generate balanced data.

Result: Outperforms vanilla Stable Diffusion and matches SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, especially with severe bias.

Conclusion: Finetuning diffusion models with cluster-aware DreamBooth enhances fairness in biased datasets.

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

### [13] [Adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold network for 3D human pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08809)
*Abu Taib Mohammed Shahjahan,A. Ben Hamza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseKAN introduces an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) framework for 3D human pose estimation, addressing limitations of GCNs like limited receptive fields and spectral bias. It uses learnable functions on edges and multi-hop aggregation for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs struggle with long-range dependencies and spectral bias in 3D pose estimation. PoseKAN aims to overcome these by leveraging adaptive graph learning and enhanced feature transformations.

Method: PoseKAN employs learnable functions on graph edges for adaptive feature learning, multi-hop aggregation for spatial awareness, residual blocks for refinement, and global response normalization for feature contrast.

Result: Experiments show PoseKAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D human pose estimation benchmarks.

Conclusion: PoseKAN successfully addresses GCNs' limitations, offering a more expressive and adaptable solution for accurate 3D pose estimation.

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

*Jingjie He,Weijie Liang,Zihan Shan,Matthew Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIFT-Graph enhances deep vision model robustness by fusing handcrafted and learned features via Graph Attention Networks, improving defense against adversarial attacks with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defenses rely on pixel-level representations, which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The goal is to incorporate robust visual features to improve resilience.

Method: Integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) keypoints with Graph Attention Networks to capture invariant local structures, fusing these with Vision Transformers/CNNs for defense.

Result: Improves robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks with only a slight decrease in clean accuracy.

Conclusion: SIFT-Graph offers a promising multimodal defense framework by leveraging structurally meaningful features for enhanced adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

*Wonbong Jang,Jonathan Tremblay,Lourdes Agapito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis from a single image, using transformer-based architecture and novel training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of existing methods constrained to small camera movements or unnatural scenes, enabling broader applications in real-world settings.

Method: Introduces DT-NVS, leveraging transformer-based architecture, novel camera conditioning, and a unique training paradigm with reference frame swapping.

Result: Improves over state-of-the-art 3D-aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, generating diverse outputs.

Conclusion: DT-NVS advances generalized novel view synthesis by effectively translating images to 3D representations and training on unaligned real-world datasets.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

*Jiaxun Guo,Manar Amayri,Nizar Bouguila,Xin Liu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SiPF and RIAttnConv to address loss of global pose info in RI learning for 3D point clouds, improving discrimination of symmetric structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RI methods lose global pose info, failing to distinguish symmetric components like airplane wings due to indistinguishable local geometries.

Method: Propose Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF) and Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv) to maintain global pose awareness while ensuring rotation invariance.

Result: Outperforms existing RI methods in 3D classification and part segmentation, especially in fine-grained spatial discrimination tasks.

Conclusion: SiPF and RIAttnConv effectively preserve global pose info and enhance discrimination of symmetric structures under arbitrary rotations.

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

### [17] [Improve Contrastive Clustering Performance by Multiple Fusing-Augmenting ViT Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08883)
*Cheng Wang,Shuisheng Zhou,Fengjiao Peng,Jin Sheng,Feng Ye,Yinli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) to enhance contrastive learning for image clustering by explicitly fusing features of positive pairs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning networks may not fully exploit the complementarity of positive pairs due to implicit interactions between encoders, limiting clustering feature extraction.

Method: The proposed MFAVBs uses shared-weight ViTs to process positive pairs, fuses their features in a larger ViT, and iteratively splits and augments features through multiple blocks. Features are projected into instance and clustering spaces for loss calculation.

Result: Experiments on seven datasets show MFAVBs surpasses state-of-the-art clustering techniques.

Conclusion: MFAVBs effectively improves contrastive clustering by explicit feature fusion and augmentation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

*Sanyukta Adap,Ujjwal Baid,Spyridon Bakas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning approach using EfficientNet architectures to classify six histopathological regions in GBM tissue sections, achieving high F1 scores on training data but lower scores on validation/testing data, highlighting generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of GBM by automating the identification of histological sub-regions, aiding morphological analysis at scale.

Method: A four-step deep learning approach using EfficientNet variants (B0-B4) evaluated on the BraTS-Path 2024 dataset with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: EfficientNet-B1 and B4 achieved F1 scores of 0.98 on training data, but scores dropped to 0.546 and 0.517 on validation and testing data, respectively.

Conclusion: While the approach shows promise, the performance gap underscores the challenge of generalizing models for clinical use.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

*Riling Wei,Kelu Yao,Chuanguang Yang,Jin Wang,Zhuoyan Gao,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD) to address challenges in knowledge transfer between weakly connected modalities, proposing the SemBridge framework for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of paired modalities necessitates a solution for knowledge transfer under weak semantic consistency.

Method: Proposes SemBridge with Student-Friendly Matching and Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment modules to optimize knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: SemBridge effectively bridges weakly connected modalities, enhancing knowledge distillation flexibility and performance.

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework enhances semi-supervised document layout detection by fusing visual predictions with LLM-derived structural priors, achieving consistent gains across model scales with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document layout understanding is data-intensive, and the paper aims to improve semi-supervised detection by leveraging LLMs for structural priors.

Method: The framework combines OCR-LLM pipeline inferences with teacher detector outputs using inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves 88.2 AP with lightweight models and 89.7 AP with pretrained models, surpassing standard methods and matching UDOP. Key findings include adaptive gating and semantic disambiguation benefits.

Conclusion: LLM structural priors complement both lightweight and pretrained architectures, offering privacy-preserving deployment and targeted semantic improvements.

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CCDF with CC and SC modules to improve unsupervised remote sensing change detection by reducing generator overfitting and enhancing detail reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses poor performance in unsupervised change detection due to generator overfitting in reconstruction-based methods.

Method: Introduces Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce overfitting and Semantic Consistency (SC) module for detail reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in experiments.

Conclusion: CCDF effectively improves change detection by mitigating overfitting and enhancing reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight spectral-based person detection method, outperforms CNN models in shape-agnostic scenarios with 93.5% AP and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based object detection struggles with shape dependency, limiting performance for postures not in training data. This study explores spectral reflectance properties for person detection.

Method: Implemented HitoMi-Cam on a resource-constrained edge device without GPU, using spectral reflectance of clothing for shape-agnostic detection.

Result: Achieved 23.2 fps (253x190 pixels) and 93.5% AP in a search and rescue scenario, outperforming CNN models (best AP 53.8%). Minimal false positives.

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam complements CNNs in unpredictable environments like disaster rescue, proving viable for real-time edge applications.

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

*Zimao Lu,Hui Xu,Bing Liu,Ke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to address hallucination issues in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC) by filtering and suppressing irrelevant entities retrieved from external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-only training for ZIC suffers from poor cross-domain generalization and hallucination. Retrieval-based methods can worsen this issue by introducing irrelevant entities.

Method: NES integrates three stages: synthetic image use for consistent retrieval, negative entity filtering, and attention-level suppression of hallucination-prone features.

Result: NES maintains in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination, achieving state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Conclusion: NES effectively reduces hallucination in ZIC by leveraging synthetic images and suppressing negative entities, offering a robust solution for cross-domain challenges.

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPEED-Q is a novel framework for quantizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices, addressing sensitivity discrepancies and training instability to achieve accurate and efficient low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying VLMs on resource-constrained edge devices requires efficient quantization methods, which current research lacks, especially for models with 1B-2B parameters.

Method: SPEED-Q uses a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism and distillation-enhanced quantization to harmonize performance and stabilize training.

Result: SPEED-Q outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 6x higher accuracy under 2-bit settings and consistently better performance in 2-bit and 4-bit configurations.

Conclusion: SPEED-Q enables efficient and accurate quantization of VLMs for edge devices, setting a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-FCHM, a novel human-machine collaborative compression method prioritizing machine-vision pipelines for efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative compression methods rely on human-vision pipelines, leading to inefficiencies for machine tasks. The paper aims to optimize for machine vision while maintaining human-vision quality.

Method: Diff-FCHM uses machine-vision-oriented compression as the basis, incorporates a variable bit-rate strategy, and leverages diffusion prior to restore details for human vision.

Result: Experiments show Diff-FCHM outperforms existing methods in both machine-vision and human-vision compression.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully integrates machine-vision efficiency with human-vision quality, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Distillation (HD), a framework combining trajectory-based and distribution-based distillation to improve diffusion models' inference latency while maintaining high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between trajectory-based methods (good global structure but lossy details) and distribution-based methods (high fidelity but unstable training) in diffusion models.

Method: HD uses trajectory distillation for structural initialization and distribution-based refinement. It also introduces Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD) for efficient detail refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., FID of 2.26 on ImageNet 256×256, rivaling a 250-step teacher model.

Conclusion: HD establishes a robust paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models, demonstrating generalizability across tasks.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: BRHVC is a novel neural B-frame video compression method that harmonizes bi-directional references using BMC and BCF, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and traditional coding like VTM-RA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) is underexplored despite its potential for better performance, and its hierarchical coding can unbalance reference frame contributions.

Method: Proposes Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC) with Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) for accurate motion compensation and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF) to model reference context weights.

Result: BRHVC outperforms previous neural video compression methods and surpasses traditional coding (VTM-RA) on HEVC datasets.

Conclusion: BRHVC effectively harmonizes bi-directional references, demonstrating superior compression performance.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Hausdorff Dimension (HD) to enhance diversity in Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) while maintaining image quality. A learnable HD estimation method and loss scheduling are introduced, achieving a 39% diversity improvement on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited diversity of FGMs due to their self-similarity by leveraging HD, a fractal geometry concept, to quantify and enhance structural complexity in generated images.

Method: Introduces a learnable HD estimation method from image embeddings, employs an HD-based loss with momentum-driven scheduling during training, and uses HD-guided rejection sampling during inference for richer outputs.

Result: On ImageNet, the FGM-HD framework improves output diversity by 39% compared to vanilla FGMs without compromising visual quality.

Conclusion: The work successfully integrates HD into FGMs, offering both practical diversity improvements and theoretical contributions to generative model development.

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Motivation: Traditional static scanned signatures lack reliable authentication and are vulnerable to misuse. There's a need for a secure and practical solution.

Method: AuthSig combines generative models and watermarking to encode authentication info into signatures. It uses a keypoint-driven augmentation strategy to improve style diversity.

Result: AuthSig achieves over 98% watermark extraction accuracy under various distortions, including print-scan scenarios.

Conclusion: AuthSig effectively addresses the limitations of static signatures, offering secure and reliable authentication.

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoDR, a novel framework for demonstration selection in in-context learning (ICL) for LVLMs, addressing inefficiencies in traditional methods by using coreset diversity and dual retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of ICL in LVLMs depends on demonstration selection, which is NP-hard. Traditional methods like random or similarity-based sampling are inefficient or suboptimal.

Method: CoDR employs a diverse coreset via cluster-pruning and a dual retrieval mechanism to ensure global selection while maintaining efficiency.

Result: Experiments show CoDR significantly outperforms existing strategies, improving ICL performance effectively and efficiently.

Conclusion: CoDR provides a robust solution for demonstration selection in ICL, balancing efficiency and effectiveness better than traditional methods.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

*Yifei Sun,Yuzhi He,Junhao Jia,Jinhong Wang,Ruiquan Ge,Changmiao Wang,Hongxia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework (WDT-MD) to improve automated detection of Microaneurysms (MAs) in diabetic retinopathy, addressing limitations like identity mapping and false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of MAs is crucial for diabetic retinopathy screening, but current diffusion-based methods suffer from identity mapping, high false positives, and poor reconstruction.

Method: WDT-MD introduces noise-encoded image conditioning, pseudo-normal pattern synthesis, and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture to enhance detection accuracy.

Result: WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets in pixel-level and image-level detection.

Conclusion: The WDT-MD framework significantly improves MA detection, offering promise for early diabetic retinopathy screening.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

*Xinyu Wang,Wenjun Yao,Fanghui Song,Zhichang Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a variational segmentation model within the ICTM framework, integrating denoising terms for noisy images with intensity inhomogeneity, using adaptive TV regularization and bias field estimation. It outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image segmentation methods struggle with heavy noise and intensity inhomogeneity. The paper aims to address these challenges by integrating denoising and bias field correction.

Method: The model combines I-divergence and adaptive TV regularization for denoising Gamma and Poisson noise. A gray-level indicator guides diffusion, and a bias field corrects intensity inhomogeneity. ICTM and RMSAV schemes optimize segmentation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world images show the model's superior accuracy and robustness against competing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles noise and intensity inhomogeneity, achieving better segmentation performance than existing approaches.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni introduces negative visual prompts to improve open-set object detection by addressing vulnerabilities to distractors, offering flexible deployment and strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-set object detectors rely solely on positive prompts, making them vulnerable to visually similar distractors. The paper aims to overcome this by incorporating negative prompts.

Method: Proposes T-Rex-Omni with a unified visual prompt encoder for positive and negative prompts, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module, and a Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss for fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves remarkable zero-shot detection performance, narrowing the gap between visual- and text-prompted methods, with strong results in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Conclusion: Negative prompts are established as a crucial advancement for open-set visual recognition systems.

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Owl is a causally-grounded framework addressing object hallucination in LVLMs by modeling attention imbalance and dynamically adjusting attention using VTACR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle object hallucination in LVLMs by addressing the overlooked interaction between visual and textual attention.

Method: Proposes Owl, which uses a structural causal graph and VTACR metric to dynamically adjust token- and layer-wise attention.

Result: Significant hallucination reduction on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks, achieving SOTA faithfulness.

Conclusion: Owl effectively mitigates hallucinations while maintaining vision-language understanding.

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Conclusion: 4KDehazeFlow is a general, efficient, and high-performing dehazing method applicable to various networks, addressing key challenges in UHD image processing.

Abstract: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image dehazing faces challenges such as limited scene adaptability in prior-based methods and high computational complexity with color distortion in deep learning approaches. To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

TL;DR: PAN is a general, interactable world model combining autoregressive latent dynamics with video diffusion for long-horizon, action-conditioned simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack causal control, interactivity, and long-horizon consistency, while current world models are domain-restricted and lack generalizability. PAN aims to bridge this gap.

Method: PAN uses Generative Latent Prediction (GLP), blending autoregressive latent dynamics (grounded in LLM knowledge) with a video diffusion decoder for detailed visual reconstruction.

Result: PAN excels in action-conditioned simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning, outperforming other models in diverse domains.

Conclusion: PAN advances general world modeling by unifying latent reasoning and real-world dynamics, enabling predictive simulation for better reasoning and acting.

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA systems struggle with culturally specific content due to underrepresented cultural knowledge and opaque reasoning processes.

Method: Combines cultural object detection, structured program generation, and a dual-modality explanation module (visual attention + textual rationales). Uses a curated Vietnamese cultural knowledge base.

Result: Demonstrated practicality with a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset, offering transparent explanations for computational rationale and cultural context.

Conclusion: VietMEAgent enhances interpretability and cultural sensitivity in VQA, supporting education and preservation efforts.

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

TL;DR: DOC enhances adversarial robustness by diversifying counterattacks using orthogonal gradients and momentum, outperforming TTC across 16 datasets while maintaining clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLPs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and existing counterattacks like TTC lack diversity, limiting their effectiveness against varied adversarial patterns.

Method: DOC introduces orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates to diversify counterattacks, along with a directional sensitivity score for adaptive strength modulation.

Result: DOC improves robustness against various attacks on 16 datasets without compromising clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Enhancing counterattack diversity via DOC effectively boosts adversarial robustness, demonstrating its superiority over gradient-only methods like TTC.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Composition-Incremental Learning (CompIL) for improving compositional generalization in zero-shot learning tasks, proposing a benchmark and a pseudo-replay framework with a visual synthesizer and linguistic distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data is dynamic and infinite in compositions, requiring models to incrementally improve compositional generalization beyond pre-collected training data.

Method: Develops CompIL benchmarks (MIT-States-CompIL, C-GQA-CompIL) and a pseudo-replay framework with visual synthesis and linguistic primitive distillation.

Result: Experiments show the framework effectively enhances compositional generalization capability incrementally.

Conclusion: The proposed CompIL approach advances incremental learning for compositional generalization, validated by benchmarks and framework performance.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: UL-TTA is a lightweight, training-free test-time adaptation method for Vision-Language Models that adjusts logit-level parameters to improve accuracy and calibration under domain shift, outperforming existing methods with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP struggle with domain shift issues such as feature drift and miscalibration. Current TTA methods are often too resource-heavy for edge scenarios.

Method: UL-TTA freezes the backbone and adapts logit-level parameters (class prototypes, priors, temperature) using an online EM-style approach with selective filtering, Bayesian updates, and lightweight safeguards.

Result: UL-TTA improves top-1 accuracy by up to 4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP and reduces calibration error by 20-30% across multiple benchmarks (~726K test samples), with low latency overhead.

Conclusion: Logit-level Bayesian adaptation suffices for state-of-the-art performance in VLMs under domain shift, eliminating the need for backbone updates.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DKDS, a dataset addressing noise challenges in Kuzushiji OCR, offering benchmarks for text/seal detection and document binarization with baseline results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR methods neglect noise like degradation and seals in Kuzushiji documents, prompting the creation of DKDS for better benchmarks.

Method: DKDS dataset construction involved Kuzushiji experts, with benchmarks for text/seal detection (using YOLO models) and binarization (traditional and GAN-based methods).

Result: Baseline results show performance for detection and binarization tasks, with dataset and code publicly available.

Conclusion: DKDS fills a critical gap in Kuzushiji OCR research, providing tools to improve recognition accuracy under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Result: Tested in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios, PIFF demonstrated effectiveness in real-time flood prediction, replacing costly simulations.

Conclusion: PIFF presents a reliable, efficient alternative for flood prediction and response by combining physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning.

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

TL;DR: MACEval introduces a Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic, scalable, and human-free assessment of large models, addressing challenges of data contamination and benchmark maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for large models are often closed-ended, prone to overfitting, and difficult to maintain due to data contamination and human-dependent curation. MACEval aims to provide a sustainable, automated solution.

Method: MACEval employs a cascaded agent network with role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing to enable interactive, autonomous evaluation of large models.

Result: Tests on 9 tasks with 23 models show MACEval is human-free, efficient, and scalable, reducing data overhead while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: MACEval offers a flexible, scalable alternative to traditional benchmarks, potentially reshaping large model evaluation.

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

TL;DR: PressTrack-HMR is a top-down pipeline recovering multi-person human meshes from tactile pressure signals, addressing challenges of intermingled signals in multi-person scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-based HMR methods face issues like occlusions and privacy concerns, prompting exploration of tactile mats as an alternative.

Method: The pipeline uses tracking-by-detection to segment individual pressure signals from raw data, followed by HMR for each signal.

Result: Achieves 89.2mm MPJPE and 112.6mm WA-MPJPE100, demonstrating effective multi-person HMR.

Conclusion: PressTrack-HMR showcases the potential of tactile mats for privacy-preserving multi-person motion analysis.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

TL;DR: DBINDS is a diffusion-model-inversion based detector analyzing latent-space dynamics to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones, showing strong cross-generator generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated video advancements threaten content security and forensic analysis, requiring detectors that generalize better to unseen generators.

Method: DBINDS leverages diffusion inversion to recover initial noise sequences, forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS), extracts multi-domain features, and uses a LightGBM classifier tuned via Bayesian search.

Result: DBINDS achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating generalization and robustness even when trained on a single generator.

Conclusion: DBINDS offers a promising approach for detecting AI-generated videos by focusing on latent-space dynamics, outperforming pixel-based methods in generalization.

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DermBench and DermEval, a framework combining a benchmark and evaluator for reliable assessment of multimodal LLMs in dermatology diagnostics, achieving close alignment with expert ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable evaluation is crucial for clinical deployment of multimodal LLMs in dermatology, addressing the bottleneck of consistent and scalable assessment.

Method: Developed DermBench (4,000 expert-certified image-narrative pairs) and DermEval (reference-free evaluator) for structured, reproducible evaluation.

Result: Achieved mean deviations of 0.251 (DermBench) and 0.117 (DermEval) from expert ratings on 4,500 cases, demonstrating reliability.

Conclusion: The framework provides clinically meaningful, scalable evaluation, critical for identifying model limitations and ensuring trustworthy diagnostics.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucinations (errors in object existence, attributes, or relations) in MLLMs to enhance reliability without external experts.

Method: Decompose responses into atomic queries, paraphrase them, estimate confidence via self-consistency or self-confidence, and refine answers with a language model.

Result: Outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces biases, and improves confidence calibration on five benchmarks.

Conclusion: TACO effectively enhances MLLM faithfulness through self-verification and confidence calibration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

*Kaixiang Shu,Kai Meng,Junqin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to disentangle foreground and background features in deep neural networks, improving interpretability and robustness by optimizing gradient-based attribution spatially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep neural networks conflate foreground and background features, reducing interpretability and robustness. The authors aim to address this by leveraging information-theoretic insights into gradient-based attribution.

Method: The proposed Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) framework maximizes mutual information between foreground features (via Vector-Jacobian Products, VJP) and inputs while minimizing it for background regions. This optimizes spatial information flow during training.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show improved foreground concentration and background suppression across six explanation methods, with consistent classification accuracy gains, without needing method-specific tuning.

Conclusion: S-IB effectively disentangles foreground and background features, enhancing model interpretability and robustness while maintaining or improving classification performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an FPGA-based deployment scheme for Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) to address edge device challenges, achieving significant energy efficiency gains over CPU and GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The AGC's decoder is resource-heavy and inflexible, making it unsuitable for edge devices. This work aims to optimize AGC deployment using FPGAs for better efficiency.

Method: The authors analyze AGC, apply network compression (quantization, layer fusion), design a co-processor accelerator with parallelization strategies, and implement it on FPGA (PYNQ-Z1).

Result: The FPGA prototype achieves 24.9× and 4.1× higher energy efficiency than CPU and GPU, respectively, consuming only 11.7 µJ per reconstructed pixel.

Conclusion: The proposed FPGA-oriented scheme successfully addresses AGC deployment challenges for edge devices, offering superior energy efficiency.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of neural architectures and signal choices for energy expenditure estimation, identifying minute ventilation as the most predictive signal and transformers as the best-performing model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle the roles of neural architecture and signal choice in energy expenditure estimation, comparing classical regression with newer deep learning methods.

Method: Comparison of classical baselines and neural architectures (transformer, CNN, ResNet with attention) across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse activities.

Result: Minute ventilation was the most predictive signal (RMSE = 0.87 W/kg). Transformers performed best, while CNN and ResNet with attention were faster alternatives for grouped signals. Low-intensity activities had better results (RMSE = 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04).

Conclusion: Strong inter-individual variability highlights the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies.

TL;DR: RichKD enhances multi-teacher knowledge distillation by integrating CLIP's cross-modal vision-language knowledge with traditional unimodal teachers, improving accuracy, confidence, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-teacher KD methods lack knowledge diversity by relying only on unimodal visual information, missing the potential of cross-modal representations like CLIP's vision-language knowledge.

Method: RichKD fuses logits and features from conventional teachers with CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, combining dataset-specific and semantically enriched cues.

Result: RichKD improves prediction confidence and accuracy, reduces errors, and enhances logit distribution semantics, outperforming baselines and showing robustness to distribution shifts.

Conclusion: RichKD demonstrates that integrating CLIP's cross-modal knowledge with traditional KD methods yields superior performance and robustness across benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models often neglect physical constraints and manufacturability, leading to impractical designs. This work aims to create designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting.

Method: The framework interprets coarse voxel grids as continuous density fields and applies three differentiable, physically constrained loss terms. It integrates with pretrained models like Trellis without architectural changes.

Result: Achieves a 43% reduction in material mass, improves stability, and maintains high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing confirms the designs are reliably fabricable.

Conclusion: DensiCrafter successfully addresses manufacturability challenges, producing lightweight, self-supporting 3D structures with significant material savings.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a feedback mechanism within the teacher-student paradigm for semi-supervised medical image segmentation to counteract error propagation caused by erroneous supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of self-reinforcing bias in the teacher-student framework due to image ambiguities and erroneous pseudo-labels in medical image segmentation.

Method: Introduces a feedback system where the student provides feedback on teacher-generated pseudo-labels, refined by a feedback attributor and receiver. A dual-teacher feedback model is also proposed for dynamic error resolution.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in reducing error propagation across three medical image benchmarks.

Conclusion: The feedback mechanism enhances the intrinsic error-correction potential of the teacher-student framework, improving semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETRs' high computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment; existing quantization methods degrade accuracy.

Method: Proposes FQ-PETR with QFPE for scale alignment, DULUT for non-linear function approximation, and QANS for attention stability.

Result: Achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) and reduces latency by up to 75%.

Conclusion: FQ-PETR effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing quantization methods.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

TL;DR: TDCNet introduces a novel temporal difference convolution module and attention mechanism for improved moving infrared small target detection by enhancing spatio-temporal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moving infrared small target detection is challenging due to weak target features and complex backgrounds, requiring better spatio-temporal feature modeling.

Method: TDCNet uses temporal difference convolution (TDC) blocks and a cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal and spatial features.

Result: Experiments show TDCNet outperforms existing methods on IRSTD-UAV and public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively modeling spatio-temporal features and suppressing background clutter.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Conclusion: $	exttt{$	extbf{Flora}$}$ successfully tackles alignment and classifier rigidity issues in zero-shot skeleton action recognition, offering a robust and flexible solution with significant experimental validation.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

### [60] [OUGS: Active View Selection via Object-aware Uncertainty Estimation in 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09397)
*Haiyi Li,Qi Chen,Denis Kalkofen,Hsiang-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OUGS improves 3DGS reconstructions by deriving uncertainty from Gaussian primitives' physical parameters and integrating semantic masks for object-focused view selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with efficient high-fidelity object reconstruction in complex scenes due to biased scene-level uncertainty metrics.

Method: OUGS uses explicit Gaussian parameters and rendering Jacobian-propagation for uncertainty modeling, augmented by semantic masks for object-awareness.

Result: OUGS enhances reconstruction efficiency and object quality over state-of-the-art methods, also providing robust global uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: OUGS offers a principled, interpretable approach for object-centric 3DGS reconstruction, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

*Hongchao Shu,Roger D. Soberanis-Mukul,Jiru Xu,Hao Ding,Morgan Ringel,Mali Shen,Saif Iftekar Sayed,Hedyeh Rafii-Tari,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-based framework for accurate bronchoscope tip localization using a synthetic benchmark dataset, achieving robust cross-domain generalization without domain-specific adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate bronchoscope tip localization is hindered by respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence, causing misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing methods lack generalizability.

Method: A vision-based pose optimization framework leverages a modality- and domain-invariant encoder to compute similarity between endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps. A differentiable rendering module refines camera poses iteratively.

Result: The model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and rotational error of 0.19 rad on synthetic data, with qualitative confirmation on real patient data showing strong cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust, domain-invariant localization, and the synthetic benchmark dataset supports standardized evaluation for vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

*Rintaro Otsubo,Kanta Sawafuji,Hideo Saito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first dedicated dataset for tracking American football players, addressing gaps in current MOT methods. It evaluates fine-tuned detection and tracking models, showing improved accuracy in crowded scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOT datasets lack focus on American football, where tracking is challenging due to occlusion and contact. The absence of standardized data hinders method comparisons.

Method: The study constructed a new dataset for American football players and evaluated fine-tuned detection models alongside re-identification models integrated into tracking systems.

Result: Fine-tuned detectors outperformed pre-trained models, and integrating them with re-ID models enhanced tracking accuracy in crowded scenarios.

Conclusion: This work fills a critical gap by enabling robust player tracking in American football, surpassing conventional methods in high-density situations.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

*Ying Peng,Hongsen Ye,Changxin Huang,Xiping Hu,Jian Chen,Runhao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework improves lightweight CNN performance by leveraging both ViT and CNN teachers with adaptive weighting and residual feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational inefficiency of ViTs and accuracy gaps of lightweight CNNs by utilizing dual-teacher knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting and Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation to guide a CNN student.

Result: Achieves up to 5.95% accuracy gain on HMDB51, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges architectural mismatches and enhances CNN performance through collaborative teacher guidance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

*Jerrin Bright,Yuhao Chen,John S. Zelek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework, enhances 3D human pose estimation by combining action-aware reasoning and temporal imagination, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks and noisy datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D pose estimation lack temporal coherence and fail to generalize due to reliance on independent geometric cues. DreamPose3D addresses this by mimicking human motion understanding.

Method: DreamPose3D uses action prompts from 2D sequences to guide denoising, incorporates kinematic joint affinity in attention, and employs a hallucinative pose decoder for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets, and excels on noisy baseball data, demonstrating robustness and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: DreamPose3D advances 3D pose estimation by integrating action awareness and temporal modeling, proving effective even with ambiguous inputs.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Method: Mina uses multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation via a chat interface.

Result: Mina scored 75-80% in Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, matching or surpassing human performance in MCQs, Written, and Viva Voce exams.

Conclusion: Mina proves effective as a low-cost, multilingual legal assistant, scaling access to justice and offering insights for domain-specific, low-resource AI systems.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

TL;DR: The paper discusses automatic attribution methods for linking summary sentences to source text, using hybrid summarization and custom topology to analyze attribution errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attribution is crucial for reporting information accurately, necessitating automated methods to link summary sentences to their sources.

Method: The paper employs hybrid summarization (automatic paraphrase of extractive summaries) and a custom topology to identify attribution-related errors.

Result: The approach facilitates easier attribution by linking summary sentences to source text and categorizing attribution errors.

Conclusion: The combination of hybrid summarization and custom topology effectively addresses attribution challenges in summarization.

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter is a novel approach for personalized LLM routing that uses a heterogeneous graph and lightweight inductive learning to capture user preferences from few-shot data, outperforming baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routing methods lack full personalization and struggle with scarce, noisy user preference data, motivating the need for a more effective solution.

Method: GMTRouter models user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types and employs a tailored message-passing mechanism to learn preferences from few-shot data.

Result: GMTRouter achieves 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC than baselines, adapting well to new users with few-shot data.

Conclusion: GMTRouter effectively personalizes LLM routing without extensive fine-tuning, demonstrating robust performance across datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

TL;DR: LLMs like Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o can mimic human social media conversations convincingly, fooling humans 39% of the time, showing promise for social simulation but also risks of misuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs can realistically simulate human group conversations on social media, addressing both potential applications and validity concerns.

Method: Collected real Reddit conversations and generated artificial ones using Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o, then had participants compare and identify the source.

Result: Participants mistook LLM-generated conversations for human content 39% of the time, with Llama 3 barely outperforming random chance (56% accuracy).

Conclusion: LLMs can produce highly realistic social media conversations, offering potential for simulation but also raising concerns about misuse for inauthentic content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' dual potential in aiding legal compliance and their risks in producing unsafe outputs, focusing on bioweapon laws.

Method: Proposes integrating knowledge graph construction with RAG to test LLMs' legal understanding, intent assessment, and safety in bioweapon scenarios.

Result: Finds LLMs lack robust reasoning and safety in legal contexts but suggests combining enhanced protocols for secure applications.

Conclusion: Improved safety and legal frameworks can help LLMs ethically assist in sensitive legal areas, preventing misuse.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

TL;DR: Soft Preference Learning improves LLM diversity by decoupling entropy terms in the KL penalty, outperforming standard methods in accuracy and societal representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the reduced diversity in LLM outputs caused by alignment algorithms like RLHF and DPO, which narrow perspectives and creativity.

Method: Introduces Soft Preference Learning, decoupling entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty for better control over output diversity.

Result: Enhanced semantic and lexical diversity, higher accuracy in tasks, and improved representation of societal viewpoints.

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning is a Pareto improvement over standard methods, offering better diversity and alignment.

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucinations in LLMs is crucial for their reliable use in high-stakes domains, prompting the need for adversarial testing.

Method: A three-step framework: generate truths/lies, verify assertions, and test robustness against self-generated lies.

Result: Evaluation shows varying resilience: Claude is strong, GPT/Grok moderate, Gemini/DeepSeek weak.

Conclusion: Findings highlight alarming susceptibility in some LLMs, raising concerns for information-seeking applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces Self-HarmLLM, where a model's own mitigated harmful query (MHQ) is reused as an attack vector, achieving notable jailbreak success rates. Automated evaluation overestimates harmfulness, highlighting flaws in current guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses ignore the risk of a model's output becoming an attack vector. This gap motivates exploring self-harm scenarios to improve guardrail robustness.

Method: Used MHQs generated by the same model (GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. Evaluated jailbreak success via automated and human methods.

Result: Achieved up to 65% transformation and 41% jailbreak success rates. Automated evaluation overestimated harmfulness by 52% compared to human evaluation.

Conclusion: Self-HarmLLM exposes flaws in current guardrails, necessitating redesign and better evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OKBench is an automated framework for creating dynamic knowledge benchmarks to evaluate LLMs on evolving information, particularly in the news domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge, and centralized curation can't keep up with rapid LLM advancements.

Method: OKBench automates sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks, focusing on daily-updated news knowledge.

Result: Tests on various LLMs show distinct behaviors with new information and how retrieval narrows performance gaps between models.

Conclusion: Dynamic benchmarks like OKBench are crucial for evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge.

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of clinical vignettes in speech-language pathology is time-consuming, and general-purpose LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and needing expert revision.

Method: A multi-model RAG-based system integrated curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, evaluating five LLMs (commercial and open-source) across seven test scenarios. Automated quality assessment used a multi-dimensional rubric.

Result: The system showed technical feasibility, with commercial models having slight quality advantages but open-source models performing acceptably, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving deployment.

Conclusion: Future validation and applications could extend to clinical decision support, IEP goal generation, and training, though further expert review and testing are needed.

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

### [75] [Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601)
*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper extends the DisCoCirc formalism to Bengali, evaluates its effectiveness in reducing language bureaucracy, and identifies limitations in English-Bengali translation, suggesting future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adapt DisCoCirc for Bengali and assess its efficacy in translation tasks, addressing structural variations between English and Bengali.

Method: The method involves extending DisCoCirc to Bengali and applying it to translation tasks, while also evaluating its performance and limitations.

Result: Results show DisCoCirc works well for much of Bengali but struggles due to structural differences, diverging from prior claims.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes DisCoCirc's limitations in translation and suggests potential improvements, also noting a connection between English conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

TL;DR: The study explores the use of LLMs in emergency medicine diagnostics, showing that a super-learner integrating multiple LLMs outperforms individual models and human doctors in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance diagnostic accuracy in emergency medicine by leveraging AI and LLMs, addressing the variability in individual model performance.

Method: Evaluated five major LLMs (Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, Claude) on real emergency cases and developed MEDAS, a super-learner using meta-learning to combine their strengths.

Result: Individual LLMs showed 58%-65% accuracy, while MEDAS achieved 70% accuracy, with one LLM reaching 85%. Meta-learning improved aggregated performance beyond any single model.

Conclusion: Super-learners like MEDAS can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy by harnessing collective LLM capabilities, offering potential advancements in medical decision-support systems.

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

TL;DR: GrADS is a gradient-aware data selection method for efficient supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, reducing resource use and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain specialization is resource-intensive and risks deteriorating general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes GrADS, a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach that prioritizes high-impact training samples using gradient analysis.

Result: GrADS achieves superior performance with just 5% of selected data, scaling effectively to 50% with further improvements, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: GrADS offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs, enhancing domain specialization without compromising general capabilities.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguous user instructions often cause incorrect tool invocations and task failures in LLM agents.

Method: Modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with EVPI objective and aspect-based cost modeling.

Result: SAGE-Agent improves task coverage by 7-39% and reduces clarification questions by 1.5-2.7x. Uncertainty-weighted GRPO boosts accuracy.

Conclusion: Structured uncertainty enhances tool-augmented agents' efficiency and task success.

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: The study developed NLP models to categorize cognitive processes in Parkinson's disease patients' narratives, comparing three models. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct performed best overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding cognitive and emotional changes in PD patients through their daily narratives provides insights, but extracting such data is challenging due to subtle, overlapping constructs.

Method: Three NLP models (Bio_ClinicalBERT, fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, GPT-4o mini) were evaluated for extracting seven cognitive categories from patient narratives.

Result: Fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest F1-scores (0.74 micro-average, 0.59 macro-average), excelling in context-dependent categories. Bio_ClinicalBERT had high precision but struggled with recall.

Conclusion: NLP systems show promise for low-burden cognitive monitoring in PD but require refinement due to the abstract nature of cognitive narratives.

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bengali NLI datasets suffer from inconsistencies like annotation errors and lack of diversity, limiting effective research.

Method: BNLI was created through a rigorous annotation pipeline ensuring semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. It was benchmarked using state-of-the-art transformer models.

Result: BNLI demonstrated improved reliability and interpretability, making it a strong foundation for Bengali and low-resource language inference tasks.

Conclusion: BNLI addresses the limitations of current Bengali NLI datasets, supporting robust language understanding and inference modeling.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

TL;DR: TACT introduces a dataset for unifying task-oriented dialogue and chitchat, with new metrics (Switch and Recovery) and DPO integration, improving intent detection and transition handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world conversations involve fluid transitions between task-oriented dialogue and chitchat, which current conversational agents struggle to handle.

Method: Introduces TACT dataset for transition-aware dialogue modeling, supports mode switches, and applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance performance.

Result: TACT-trained models outperform baselines, achieving 75.74% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1% win rate against GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Coupling diverse data with DPO improves response quality and transition control, advancing proactive conversational agents.

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

TL;DR: BioVerge introduces a benchmark and LLM-based agent framework for biomedical hypothesis generation, leveraging structured and textual data to enhance novelty and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hypothesis generation methods rely on limited data types or predefined patterns, restricting novel discoveries. Advances in LLMs offer potential but lack standardized datasets and environments.

Method: Developed BioVerge benchmark and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based framework using a ReAct approach with Generation and Evaluation modules for iterative hypothesis proposal and assessment.

Result: Experiments show BioVerge Agent's architecture affects exploration diversity, structured/textual data enriches hypotheses, and self-evaluation boosts novelty and relevance.

Conclusion: BioVerge provides a standardized environment for biomedical hypothesis generation, demonstrating LLM agents' potential with structured data and self-evaluation.

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how citation frequency affects LLMs' accuracy in generating bibliographic records, finding strong correlation between high citation counts and lower hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of LLMs hallucinating non-existent papers in citation recommendations by investigating the role of citation frequency as a proxy for training data redundancy.

Method: Generate and manually verify 100 citations across computer-science domains using GPT-4.1, measuring factual consistency via cosine similarity.

Result: Citation count strongly correlates with accuracy; bibliographic info is memorized verbatim beyond ~1,000 citations; memory interference occurs with similar highly cited papers.

Conclusion: Highly cited papers are nearly verbatim memorized, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts to memorization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Conclusion: HalluClean demonstrates potential to enhance LLM reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: TiDAR is a hybrid architecture combining diffusion and autoregressive methods for efficient parallel token drafting and sampling, balancing throughput and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between diffusion models' parallel generation and autoregressive models' superior quality by achieving synergy with high throughput and AR-level quality.

Method: TiDAR drafts tokens using diffusion ('Thinking') and samples outputs autoregressively ('Talking') in a single forward pass with structured attention masks, leveraging GPU compute density.

Result: TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in throughput and surpasses diffusion models in efficiency and quality, closing the gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Conclusion: TiDAR successfully balances drafting efficiency and verification capacity, achieving AR-level quality with parallel generation benefits.

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

TL;DR: EVADE is a new framework using LLMs to generate and validate explanations for detecting errors in NLP datasets, outperforming human annotators in refining data and improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the cost and limitations of manual annotation in detecting human label variation (HLV) by leveraging LLMs for scalable error detection.

Method: Proposes EVADE framework: uses LLMs to generate and validate explanations, compares human- and LLM-detected errors via distribution analysis, validation overlap, and fine-tuning impact.

Result: LLM validation aligns explanation distributions closer to human annotations, and removing LLM-detected errors improves fine-tuning performance more than human-detected errors.

Conclusion: EVADE shows promise in scaling error detection, reducing human effort, and enhancing dataset quality under HLV.

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

TL;DR: SpiralThinker introduces a unified framework for latent reasoning with iterative updates, achieving top performance across reasoning tasks by aligning latent and textual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of stable evolution mechanisms in existing latent reasoning methods and the need for an interleaving of implicit and explicit reasoning.

Method: SpiralThinker uses iterative updates over latent representations and a progressive alignment objective with structured annotations.

Result: SpiralThinker outperforms previous latent reasoning methods across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Iteration and alignment are critical for effective latent reasoning, with SpiralThinker successfully bridging iterative computation and latent reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

TL;DR: The paper addresses gaps in evaluating LLMs for emotional support by proposing a trajectory-based framework that tracks user emotional states over time, using validated strategies and introducing new metrics for long-term assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs for emotional support are limited by short, static dialogues, failing to capture dynamic, long-term interactions. This paper aims to provide a more realistic assessment.

Method: The authors develop a trajectory-based framework with a large-scale benchmark (328 emotional contexts, 1,152 disturbance events), validated emotion regulation strategies, and Markov modeling of user emotional trajectories. Three new metrics (BEL, ETV, ECP) are introduced for evaluation.

Result: Evaluations reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities across LLMs, highlighting actionable insights for improving model performance in long-term emotional interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances LLM evaluation for emotional support by focusing on dynamic, long-term interactions and providing robust metrics, offering practical guidance for future model development.

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic framework combines LLMs with human guidance to formalize and validate natural language policies, achieving high correctness in regulated industries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the stochasticity of LLMs and enable their reliable use in regulated industries like finance and healthcare.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) formalizing policies with LLMs and human guidance, (2) validating logical correctness via inference-time autoformalization.

Result: Exceeds 99% soundness with auditable logical artifacts.

Conclusion: The framework ensures reliable policy adherence and logical correctness in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critique ability is crucial for AI models to self-improve, but multimodal critique remains underexplored despite LMMs' growing capabilities.

Method: MM-CRITIC evaluates LMMs' critique abilities across basic, correction, and comparison dimensions, using 8 task types and 500+ tasks. Expert-informed ground answers are used to guide GPT-4o in annotating responses.

Result: Experiments show MM-CRITIC's effectiveness, revealing insights like correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across dimensions.

Conclusion: MM-CRITIC provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' critique capabilities, aiding future improvements in multimodal AI assistants.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

TL;DR: A streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan using a hybrid CTC/Attention architecture with dynamic chunking and linguistic lexicon improves accuracy and reduces latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the context truncation problem in fixed-chunk methods and adapt to Tibetan's linguistic characteristics.

Method: Hybrid CTC/Attention architecture with dynamic chunking, linguistically motivated lexicon, and external language model integration.

Result: Achieves 6.23% WER, a 48.15% improvement over baseline, with reduced latency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances accuracy and latency for Amdo Tibetan speech recognition.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bi-RAR improves retrieval-augmented reasoning by evaluating intermediate steps bidirectionally and optimizing with multi-objective reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods lack guidance for intermediate reasoning steps, leading to degraded response quality. This work addresses the limitation by proposing bidirectional evaluation.

Method: Bi-RAR introduces bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and uses multi-objective reinforcement learning with cascading rewards for optimization.

Result: Empirical results on seven benchmarks show Bi-RAR outperforms previous methods in efficient search-engine interaction and reasoning.

Conclusion: Bi-RAR effectively mitigates hallucinations in multi-step reasoning scenarios, enhancing retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' humor capabilities using Oogiri comedy games, highlighting their strength in novelty but weakness in empathy compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multifaceted humor evaluation in LLM research and improve their emotional intelligence in conversational applications.

Method: Expanded Oogiri datasets with LLM-generated responses, annotated them across six dimensions, and compared human and LLM performance.

Result: LLMs perform between low- and mid-tier humans in humor generation but lack empathy, leading to divergent evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: LLMs prioritize novelty over empathy in humor assessment, suggesting a need for emotionally smarter models.

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Motivation: Personalized learning enhances engagement and motivation in EFL education, particularly in reading comprehension.

Method: A structured pipeline uses gpt-4o to transcreate RACE-C dataset passages and questions, aligning them with student interests. Methods include topic extraction, Bloom's taxonomy classification, linguistic analysis, and transcreation.

Result: Students using personalized materials showed better comprehension and motivation retention than those with non-personalized materials.

Conclusion: Personalizing reading materials improves EFL learners' comprehension and motivation, validating the efficacy of interest-aligned content.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

TL;DR: DoPE is a training-free method that detects outlier frequency bands in positional encoding feature maps using truncated matrix entropy, improving extrapolation and mitigating attention sinks in Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the inherent limitations of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformers, which weaken length extrapolation, by proposing a denoising strategy for positional embeddings.

Method: DoPE reinterprets attention maps with positional encoding as noisy feature maps, detects outlier frequency bands using truncated matrix entropy, and reparameterizes them with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution.

Result: Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks show DoPE improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability for contexts up to 64K tokens.

Conclusion: DoPE effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, offering a simple yet powerful solution for better length generalization.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

TL;DR: LoopTool is an automated, model-aware framework that integrates data synthesis and model training to improve LLMs' tool-use capabilities by iteratively refining data and the model through three modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static synthetic data pipelines hinder tool learning in LLMs by failing to adapt to model weaknesses and allowing noisy labels, reducing training efficiency.

Method: LoopTool uses Greedy Capability Probing (GCP), Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV), and Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) to iteratively refine data and model.

Result: An 8B model trained with LoopTool outperforms its 32B data generator and achieves state-of-the-art results on BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: Closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines significantly enhance LLMs' tool-use capabilities.

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposed a cell extraction method for Table Question Answering (TQA) using hybrid retrieval and contrastive learning, achieving 74.6% accuracy and outperforming GPT-4o mini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly inputting tables into LLMs for TQA often yields incorrect answers due to their inability to capture complex table structures.

Method: Estimates table headers via hybrid retrieval (language model + TF-IDF), selects answer cells at relevant intersections, and trains the model using contrastive learning.

Result: Achieved 74.6% accuracy on the NTCIR-18 U4 dataset, surpassing GPT-4o mini's 63.9%.

Conclusion: Future work aims to integrate efficient text-search models to further improve performance and align with human evaluation.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

TL;DR: The paper validates the use of context-based sequentiality over topic-based measures, showing it aligns better with human assessments and improves predictive performance when combined with linguistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critiques of the original sequentiality measure by empirically validating the use of context-based sequentiality and demonstrating its advantages in automated essay scoring.

Method: Empirical validation using two human-annotated essay datasets (ASAP++ and ELLIPSE), comparing context-based sequentiality with topic-based and original measures, and combining it with linguistic features.

Result: Context-based sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments and adds predictive value when combined with linguistic features, outperforming zero-shot LLM predictions.

Conclusion: Context-based sequentiality is validated as interpretable and complementary for automated essay scoring, emphasizing explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence flow.

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how subword segmentation evolves dynamically during pretraining and finetuning in language models, focusing on three typologically diverse languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learning dynamics of subword segmentation when optimized during training, particularly its impact on pretraining and finetuning.

Method: Extends the subword segmental language model (SSLM) to study subword evolution in Isi-Xhosa, Setswana, and English, analyzing morphology and productivity.

Result: Identifies four stages of subword learning, with morphologically complex languages like Isi-Xhosa showing instability. Subword boundaries become finer-grained during finetuning.

Conclusion: Learnable subwords improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer, especially for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLVR for aligning language models with reasoning tasks, highlighting the challenge of honesty alignment and proposing a method called Anchor to stabilize training and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of models collapsing during early training due to negative rewards, especially in honesty alignment tasks where models must identify unanswerable queries.

Method: Curates two deductive reasoning datasets, evaluates GRPO and stabilization strategies, and proposes Anchor, which injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts.

Result: Anchor stabilizes learning and significantly improves reasoning performance compared to GRPO and other stabilization methods.

Conclusion: Training dynamics are crucial for reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models, with Anchor offering an effective solution.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

TL;DR: POTSA leverages Optimal Transport and Bias Compensation to improve multilingual speech-to-text translation, achieving SOTA results with minimal parallel data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SpeechLLMs often ignore semantic commonalities across languages, leading to biased translation performance. POTSA aims to bridge the gap between high- and low-resource languages.

Method: POTSA combines a Bias Compensation module for coarse alignment and token-level Optimal Transport constraints for fine-grained consistency. It also uses layer scheduling to focus OT on beneficial layers.

Result: Experiments on FLEURS show POTSA achieves +0.93 BLEU on common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages with only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Conclusion: POTSA significantly improves translation performance by addressing cross-lingual semantic biases and leveraging Optimal Transport efficiently.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with precise multi-attribute control and conflict resolution in text generation, lacking iterative optimization.

Method: Proposes C$^3$TG, pairing LLMs with attribute classifiers and using weighted KL-divergence and an energy function for iterative optimization.

Result: Significantly outperforms baselines in attribute accuracy, fluency, diversity, and reduces toxicity.

Conclusion: C$^3$TG is an effective, flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control without model modifications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Motivation: To address the lack of personalization in LLMs for creative writing, which often treat diverse tastes as uniform.

Method: Collected reading habits and preferences from 60 individuals (stated and revealed preferences) and finetuned a transformer encoder to model these preferences.

Conclusion: LiteraryTaste enables personalized creative writing models, serving as a foundation for future work.

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

### [106] [Towards Explainable Khmer Polarity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09313)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an explainable Khmer polarity classifier using Qwen-3, providing reasoning for predictions and releasing a new Khmer polarity dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Khmer polarity models lack explainability, prompting the need for a model that rationalizes predictions.

Method: Fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model to classify polarity and generate self-explanations.

Result: The model accurately predicts labels and identifies keywords/phrases to support predictions. A new Khmer polarity dataset is also contributed.

Conclusion: The proposed explainable classifier and dataset advance Khmer NLP by combining accuracy with transparency.

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

*Zhuoqun Huang,Neil G. Marchant,Olga Ohrimenko,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaptDel methods improve certified robustness for sequence classification by dynamically adjusting deletion rates based on input properties, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with varying input lengths due to fixed-rate deletion mechanisms, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduce AdaptDel with adaptable deletion rates and extend randomized smoothing theory to variable-rate deletion.

Result: Empirical results show up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement in certified region cardinality.

Conclusion: AdaptDel outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness certification for sequence classification.

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mmJEE-Eval introduces a multimodal bilingual benchmark to evaluate true scientific reasoning in VLMs, revealing significant gaps between frontier and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to distinguish true reasoning from pattern-matching in VLMs, prompting the creation of mmJEE-Eval for deeper evaluation.

Method: The benchmark uses 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced exam (2019-2025) in Physics, Chemistry, and Math, evaluated on 17 state-of-the-art models.

Result: Frontier VLMs (e.g., GPT-5) achieve 77-84% accuracy, while open-source models plateau at 37-45%. Closed models collapse under increased reasoning load (GPT-5 fixes only 5.2% errors).

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval effectively segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth.

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeerSC is a dynamic self-consistency framework integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning to enhance token efficiency and reduce latency in LLMs, achieving significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and latency issues in LLMs during test-time scaling while maintaining performance.

Method: Proposes SeerSC, leveraging System 1 for rapid entropy calculation and System 2 for dynamic self-consistency, enabling parallel generation.

Result: Achieves up to 47% reduction in token usage and 43% lower latency without major performance loss.

Conclusion: SeerSC effectively balances efficiency and performance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite tool enable SPARQL to Cypher translation with superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing SPARQL-to-Cypher translation tools by offering a lightweight, rule-based solution without needing RDF graphs or external tools.

Method: Developed S2CLite, a rule-based parser inspired by programming language compilers, tested on BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets.

Result: Achieved 77.8% parsing accuracy on Spider4SPARQL (vs. 44.2% by S2CTrans) and 96.6% execution accuracy on intersecting queries.

Conclusion: S2CLite outperforms state-of-the-art tools, and Spider4SSC dataset facilitates unified Text-to-Query language research.

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty about LLMs' general text quality evaluation capabilities, especially in multilingual contexts.

Method: Develop MTQ-Eval by generating text quality preference data and training open-source LLMs to align with quality ratings.

Result: Improved performance in multilingual text quality evaluation across 115 languages; downstream tasks also benefit.

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval effectively enhances multilingual text quality evaluation and positively impacts downstream applications.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

*Hossein A. Rahmani,Satyapriya Krishna,Xi Wang,Mohammadmehdi Naghiaei,Emine Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) self-correct differently in open-ended text generation versus multiple-choice tasks, revealing distinct improvement patterns and failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of LLM self-correction mechanisms across different task paradigms (open-ended generation vs. multiple-choice selection) and their implications for practical applications.

Method: Systematic comparison of performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, using LLMs of different scales and families.

Result: Open-ended generation benefits from flexibility, while multiple-choice tasks leverage clearer boundaries but may be constrained by options.

Conclusion: Self-correction mechanism design should consider task structure and output space interactions, impacting both reasoning and decision-making applications of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMaPO resolves the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma in offline preference optimization with adaptive margins, improving ranking accuracy and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline preference optimization methods suffer from overfitting and underfitting due to static margin designs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: AMaPO introduces an instance-wise adaptive margin refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling to dynamically adjust learning effort.

Result: AMaPO achieves better ranking accuracy and alignment performance while mitigating overfitting and underfitting.

Conclusion: The adaptive margin approach in AMaPO effectively addresses critical limitations in offline preference optimization.

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

*Lukas Arana,Julen Etxaniz,Ander Salaberria,Gorka Azkune*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Developing Basque multimodal LLM with low-resource data achieves solid results without needing a Basque-adapted backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a strong multimodal large language model (MLLM) for Basque, a low-resource language, filling a gap in open science.

Method: Built custom image-text datasets, trained using Llama-3.1-Instruct and Basque-adapted Latxa models, testing various data mixtures.

Result: Achieved strong Basque benchmarks with only 20% Basque data; Basque-adapted backbone not necessary.

Conclusion: Supports developing MLLMs for low-resource languages using minimal language-specific data and open resources.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

TL;DR: CARE-Bench is introduced as a dynamic, interactive benchmark to evaluate LLMs' counseling competence, addressing limitations of current methods and providing insights for improving counseling models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for psychological counseling and limited service availability drive the need for LLMs in this domain, requiring a robust benchmark.

Method: CARE-Bench uses diverse client profiles from real cases, expert-simulated interactions, and multidimensional evaluation based on psychological scales.

Result: Evaluation of general-purpose and specialized LLMs reveals current limitations, with detailed failure analysis conducted alongside psychologists.

Conclusion: CARE-Bench highlights directions for developing more comprehensive and effective counseling models.

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and reproducibility of ML research by extracting fine-grained information like method training and data usage from scientific publications.

Method: Introduces GSAP-ERE, a dataset with 10 entity types and 18 relation types from 100 ML publications, used to train fine-tuned models and test LLM prompting strategies.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperform LLMs (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1%), showing the need for datasets like GSAP-ERE in scholarly IE.

Conclusion: GSAP-ERE advances ML research by enabling fine-grained IE and demonstrating the limitations of unsupervised LLM methods.

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting personalities from large text volumes is challenging, necessitating an efficient strategy to handle input limits and improve accuracy.

Method: Proposes BIG5-TPoT model, which uses semantic filtering (TPoT) to select relevant texts for predicting Big Five traits, facets, or items.

Result: Improves Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

Conclusion: TPoT is an effective strategy for enhancing personality predictions by focusing on semantically relevant texts.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for analyzing agent interactions in multi-agent systems, focusing on misaligned objectives and their impact on equilibrium, bias, and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and predict the dynamics of agent interactions when objectives are misaligned, linking prompt design and interaction setup to system stability.

Method: Theoretical analysis of iterative gradient updates by language-model-based agents, validated with experiments using transformer models and GPT-5 for linear regression.

Result: Misaligned objectives lead to biased equilibrium with predictable residual errors, and conditions for asymmetric convergence are established.

Conclusion: The framework provides tools to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems, emphasizing the role of prompt design in stability and robustness.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework to address challenges in MAMOS by learning global utility functions during training while enabling decentralized execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) face challenges with heterogeneous objectives and utility functions, intensifying training non-stationarity. Existing methods struggle without access to global utility functions.

Method: The AA-MAMORL framework learns joint beliefs over agents' utility functions and policies during centralized training, enabling decentralized execution without inter-agent communication.

Result: Experiments in custom and benchmark environments show AA-MAMORL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by leveraging global preferences.

Conclusion: Access to global utility functions and the AA-MAMORL framework enhance MAMOS performance, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for optimizing multi-agent communication protocols in MARL, proposing three efficiency metrics (IEI, SEI, TEI) to enhance messaging and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL research lacks thorough investigation of communication protocol definitions and optimization, leading to inefficient information exchange.

Method: A generalized framework with three Communication Efficiency Metrics (IEI, SEI, TEI) is proposed to guide protocol learning, integrating IEI and SEI into loss functions and using TEI for evaluation.

Result: The learned protocol improves communication efficiency and cooperation performance, achieving higher success rates.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses inefficiencies in MARL communication, enhancing both message quality and overall system performance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex interactions among autonomous entities in distributed environments. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our learned communication protocol can significantly enhance communication efficiency and achieves better cooperation performance with improved success rates.

*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method translates English to ASP programs for logic puzzles using LLMs and AMR graphs, minimizing LLM reliance for a lightweight, explainable system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP is powerful but requires syntax knowledge, and non-programmers increasingly need to interact with code. The goal is to simplify this process.

Method: Uses LLMs for simplifying sentences, identifying keywords, and generating facts, while AMR graphs parse simplified language to generate ASP constraints systematically.

Result: The system successfully creates complete ASP programs solving combinatorial logic problems, demonstrating effectiveness with example puzzles.

Conclusion: This approach advances lightweight, explainable natural language conversion for solving complex logic problems.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

*Isaac Joffe,Chris Eliasmith*

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic solver using Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs) achieves promising results on the ARC-AGI benchmark by combining System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ARC-AGI benchmark is challenging for AI despite being easy for humans. The paper aims to bridge this gap using cognitively plausible methods.

Method: The solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning via VSAs, enabling object-centric program synthesis and sample-efficient neural learning.

Result: The solver scored 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval, while outperforming GPT-4 on simpler benchmarks at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The approach is novel and cognitively plausible, marking progress in solving ARC-AGI with VSAs.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

*Mehrdad Zakershahrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QDIN introduces specialized neural modules for diverse queries in RL, showing near-perfect inference accuracy even with suboptimal control, suggesting separate representations for knowledge and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the traditional RL focus on reward maximization, proposing systems designed as versatile inference engines for diverse environmental queries.

Method: QDIN uses query-conditioned deterministic inference networks with specialized modules for different query types (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons).

Result: QDIN achieves near-perfect inference accuracy (99% reachability IoU) despite suboptimal control performance (31% return), outperforming unified models and post-hoc extraction.

Conclusion: QDIN supports designing RL systems as queryable knowledge bases, enhancing interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

### [125] [AI Founding Fathers: A Case Study of GIS Search in Multi-Agent Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09005)
*Alvin Chauhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for enhancing LLM reasoning by structuring multi-agent pipelines with GIS search and validates recursive refinement (RR) as an effective method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extract stronger reasoning capabilities from LLMs by leveraging structured search-based interpretations.

Method: Implement recursive refinement (RR) in multi-agent pipelines for GIS search, comparing simple vs. complex models with historical personas.

Result: Complex models outperformed simple ones in reasoning quality (avg. score 88.3 vs. 71.7), showing deeper analysis and nuance.

Conclusion: Recursive refinement is effective for improving LLM reasoning through GIS search.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Neural Value Iteration, a novel POMDP planning algorithm that uses neural networks to represent the value function, addressing scalability issues in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional POMDP solvers become intractable for large-scale problems due to high computational costs of Bellman backups with α-vectors.

Method: The authors leverage the PWLC property to represent the value function as neural networks, combining neural generalization with value iteration.

Result: Neural Value Iteration achieves near-optimal solutions in extremely large POMDPs where existing solvers fail.

Conclusion: The approach successfully scales POMDP planning by integrating neural networks, offering practical solutions for large problems.

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

TL;DR: MAKER is the first system to solve tasks exceeding one million LLM steps error-free by decomposing tasks into subtasks handled by microagents, enabling scalable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of LLMs in performing long-range tasks due to persistent error rates, aiming to scale processes akin to human or organizational levels.

Method: Extreme decomposition of tasks into subtasks managed by focused microagents, coupled with a multi-agent voting scheme for error correction.

Result: Achieved zero-error performance on tasks with over one million LLM steps, demonstrating scalability beyond current LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: Massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) offer a viable alternative to traditional LLM improvements for solving complex, large-scale problems.

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UCO enhances LLMs as tutors using multi-turn reinforcement learning with dynamic reward functions for real-time cognitive adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLMs' ability to dynamically adapt teaching strategies based on students' genuine understanding and evolving cognitive states.

Method: Proposes Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) with Progress Reward and Scaffold Reward to track and adapt to student learning.

Result: UCO outperforms 11 baseline models and matches advanced closed-source models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: UCO addresses key limitations in LLM-based tutoring by enabling real-time cognitive adaptation and improved teaching effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Result: Achieves human-level efficiency in completing a five-hour storyline in Genshin Impact and performs diverse tasks across 3D and 2D environments with strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: Lumine represents progress toward generalist agents capable of functioning across diverse open-world environments.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

TL;DR: Bioacoustic AI systems overlook the interaction between recursive AI cognition and species communication, proposing a shift from pattern recognition to diplomatic encounters for better understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the overlooked interaction between AI's recursive cognition and recursive communicative processes in other species, highlighting potential distortions in understanding animal communication.

Method: Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work, the author critiques current AI approaches and proposes a reconceptualization of bioacoustic AI as diplomatic encounters between recursive cognitive agents.

Result: The analysis reveals a double contingency problem where AI's processing may obscure species' communicative structures, necessitating new evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that bioacoustic AI should shift from universal pattern recognition to diplomatic encounters, impacting model design and research methodologies.

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

*Xiaohan Zhang,Tian Gao,Mingyue Cheng,Bokai Pan,Ze Guo,Yaguo Liu,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaCast introduces a human-LLM co-reasoning framework for interactive time series forecasting, emphasizing adaptability and accuracy through automated prediction preparation and generative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting approaches lack interaction and adaptability, limiting their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. AlphaCast aims to bridge this gap by integrating human wisdom and LLM intelligence.

Method: AlphaCast involves two stages: automated prediction preparation (building cognitive foundations) and generative reasoning (integrating features, knowledge, and strategies for continuous refinement).

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate AlphaCast's superior predictive accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines on short- and long-term datasets.

Conclusion: AlphaCast successfully redefines forecasting as an interactive process, achieving higher accuracy and adaptability by combining human and LLM intelligence.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact computation of extensions in ABA under stable semantics is computationally intractable for large frameworks, necessitating scalable approximation methods.

Method: The authors model ABA frameworks as dependency graphs and propose two GNN architectures (ABAGCN and ABAGAT) using residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, trained on ICCMA 2023 benchmark data.

Result: Both architectures outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline, achieving node-level F1 scores up to 0.71. A polynomial-time extension-reconstruction algorithm also performs well (F1 > 0.85 on small frameworks).

Conclusion: This work advances scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation, promising new avenues for tackling large ABA frameworks.

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Argus, a resilience-oriented framework for end-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs) to monitor and mitigate driving hazards, improving safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems face diverse hazards on public roads, raising the need for resilience to maintain safety and performance.

Method: Argus continuously monitors ADS trajectories for hazards and takes control via a hazard mitigator when unsafe conditions are detected.

Result: Argus improves driving scores by up to 150.30% and prevents up to 64.38% of safety violations with minimal time overhead.

Conclusion: Argus effectively enhances ADS resilience, ensuring safer and more robust driving behaviors in complex scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Motivation: To address poor sample efficiency and adaptability issues of conventional RL in AVs for emergency services.

Method: Reviews DM-augmented RL (for robustness) and LLM-assisted ICL (for lightweight adaptation).

Result: DM-augmented RL enhances policy robustness but increases costs; LLM-assisted ICL offers interpretable, rapid adaptation.

Conclusion: The paper provides a framework for advancing AV intelligence in emergency response using Generative AI.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the expertise and data barriers in translating natural language problem descriptions into formal OR models and solver code.

Method: Two-stage approach: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for reasoning patterns and Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) for capability improvement.

Result: Achieves 67.7% solving accuracy with 1/10 the data of prior methods, outperforming ORLM by up to 4.2%. TGRPO adds 3.1%-6.4% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: OR-R1 offers a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization, significantly reducing expertise and data requirements.

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

TL;DR: A History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework is proposed to enhance GUI agents' episodic reasoning by improving short-term memory and leveraging historical interactions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents lack awareness of historical interactions, limiting their performance in automation tasks. Addressing this gap can improve task execution reliability.

Method: The HAR framework includes reflective learning scenarios, correction guidelines, and a hybrid RL reward function, applied in the HAR-GUI-3B model to enhance short-term memory.

Result: HAR-GUI-3B shows improved performance across GUI benchmarks, demonstrating effective episodic reasoning and generalization.

Conclusion: The HAR framework successfully addresses history-agnostic reasoning in GUI agents, enhancing their automation capabilities.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

*Leyang Yang,Ziwei Wang,Xiaoxuan Tang,Sheng Zhou,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProBench introduces a comprehensive mobile benchmark with 200+ GUI tasks, extending evaluation beyond final state to include process-related tasks for precise performance assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in evaluating GUI agents accurately by capturing intermediate steps, not just final states, which current benchmarks overlook.

Method: ProBench includes State-related and Process-related Tasks, uses a Process Provider for accurate process information, and evaluates advanced GUI agents.

Result: Evaluation reveals significant limitations in current GUI agents across diverse models, highlighting universal problems for future improvements.

Conclusion: ProBench provides a detailed benchmark highlighting shortcomings in GUI agents, offering concrete directions for future research.

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

*Yuhao Wang,Xiaopeng Li,Cheng Gong,Ziru Liu,Suiyun Zhang,Rui Liu,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) and Reward Function (CRF) to address overthinking in large reasoning models (LRMs), improving accuracy and reducing token length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 suffer from overthinking, leading to verbose responses and higher computational costs. Existing solutions with length penalties face issues like length collapse and training collapse.

Method: Proposes training a CRM to score reasoning path conciseness and introduces CRF, linking outcome rewards to conciseness scores for better reasoning.

Result: Experiments show 8.1% accuracy improvement and 19.9% token reduction on Qwen2.5-7B, with generalization to other LLMs like Llama and Mistral.

Conclusion: CRM and CRF effectively mitigate overthinking, enhancing both reasoning efficiency and performance, with publicly available code and datasets.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

*Niclas Flehmig,Mary Ann Lundteigen,Shen Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses reliability challenges in agentic AI systems, proposing a two-layered monitoring framework (out-of-distribution detection and AI transparency) to mitigate risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems, while promising for autonomy, lack reliability, making them risky for critical domains like healthcare. This work aims to address their operational unreliability.

Method: Derived reliability challenges from agentic AI characteristics, linked them to traditional AI, and proposed a two-layered monitoring framework (out-of-distribution detection and AI transparency).

Result: The framework enables human operators to identify and intervene in unreliable outputs, laying groundwork for risk mitigation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances reliability monitoring for agentic AI, offering decision support to human operators and reducing operational risks.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedFuse is a framework using multiplicative fusion (MuFuse) to model irregular clinical time series, outperforming existing methods by capturing higher-order feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing additive embedding strategies struggle with value-dependent feature interactions in irregular EHR data.

Method: Proposes MedFuse with MuFuse module, fusing value and feature embeddings multiplicatively.

Result: Outperforms baselines on predictive tasks; multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and pretraining.

Conclusion: MedFuse is a generalizable solution for irregular clinical time series.

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

*Minlan Shao,Zijian Zhang,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xu Shen,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperD is a novel traffic forecasting framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components, addressing spatial dependencies and multi-scale patterns. It outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic forecasting is challenged by complex spatial dependencies and multi-scale periodic patterns mixed with irregular events, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: HyperD decouples traffic data into periodic (handled by Hybrid Periodic Representation Module) and residual (modeled by Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module) components, using Dual-View Alignment Loss for semantic separation.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show HyperD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HyperD effectively tackles traffic forecasting challenges, offering superior performance and practical benefits.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shifting from 'model training' to 'model raising' integrates alignment with human values from the start by redesigning training corpora to include first-person perspectives, lived experiences, social interactions, and scaffolded data ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI training separates core capabilities from alignment, leading to easily misaligned models. Early integration of values is crucial as AI capabilities surpass human abilities.

Method: Proposes redesigning training corpora with first-person perspectives, lived experiences, social interactions, and scaffolded data ordering to embed values intrinsically.

Result: Expected outcome: models with deeply rooted values, making knowledge, skills, and values inseparable from the beginning.

Conclusion: Early integration of alignment ('model raising') is essential to prevent misalignment as AI capabilities advance.

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

TL;DR: AI advances have overlooked qualitative research, creating a gap. Dedicated qualitative AI systems, designed for transparency and privacy, could bridge this gap and enhance mixed-methods research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI's impact on quantitative methods, qualitative research lacks tailored AI tools, relying instead on general-purpose systems with significant limitations.

Method: Argues for the development of qualitative AI systems specifically for interpretive research, emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and privacy.

Result: Identifies opportunities where qualitative AI could enhance automated discovery pipelines and advance multidisciplinary research.

Conclusion: Qualitative AI systems are essential for integrating qualitative dimensions into scientific discovery, addressing current gaps and limitations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

TL;DR: Updated evaluation shows GPT-5's planning performance is competitive with LAMA on standard PDDL domains but degrades under obfuscation, though less severely than prior LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reasoning capacity of frontier LLMs (DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5) for end-to-end planning tasks compared to traditional planners like LAMA.

Method: Evaluated models by prompting them to generate plans from PDDL domain and task descriptions, testing on standard and obfuscated domains from the International Planning Competition.

Result: GPT-5 matches LAMA's performance on standard PDDL domains. Under obfuscation, all LLMs decline but less severely than older models, showing significant improvement.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs like GPT-5 have narrowed the performance gap with traditional planners, demonstrating substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve scientific discovery by accessing and disentangling learned representations in high-dimensional domains.

Result: Experiments on synthetic Gaussian, colored MNIST, and Galaxy10 datasets demonstrate meaningful feature extraction capabilities.

Conclusion: The method offers a simple yet effective way to analyze, control, and reuse latent representations, advancing generative models for scientific exploration.

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench evaluates multimodal LLMs' ability for fine-grained procedural reasoning in crochet, revealing gaps between surface understanding and executable precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess procedural competence in multimodal models, shifting focus from high-level description to executable actions in crochet.

Method: Uses CrochetPARADE DSL for validation, testing stitch classification, instruction grounding, and NL/image-to-DSL translation.

Result: Performance drops sharply when shifting from surface similarity to executable correctness, exposing reasoning limitations.

Conclusion: CrochetBench highlights the gap in models' procedural synthesis and symbolic reasoning in creative domains.

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

*Adam Tauman Kalai,Yael Tauman Kalai,Or Zamir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consensus sampling algorithm for AI safety by aggregating multiple generative models, inheriting safety from the safest subset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety approaches relying on model inspection may miss undetectable risks. The goal is to enhance safety through model aggregation.

Method: A consensus sampling algorithm leverages output probabilities from multiple models, ensuring safety from the safest subset and abstaining in cases of insufficient agreement.

Result: The algorithm achieves risk levels competitive with the safest subset of models, with bounds on abstention probability when safe models agree.

Conclusion: This model-agnostic approach amplifies safety guarantees by leveraging multiple models, though it requires safe model overlap and offers no protection if all models are unsafe.

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physical AI, emphasizing intelligence as emerging from real interactions between body, environment, and experience, unlike classical AI's symbolic or data-driven approaches. It outlines six fundamentals (embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, context sensitivity) forming a closed control loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical foundation for Physical AI, addressing the gap in understanding intelligence as an embodied, interactive process rather than abstract computation.

Method: Presenting six core principles (embodiment, perception, action, learning, autonomy, context sensitivity) as interconnected elements forming a closed control loop. A practical example of an adaptive assistant robot illustrates their interaction.

Result: Demonstrates that Physical AI's intelligence emerges from embodied experience and real interactions, validated through theoretical explanation and practical application.

Conclusion: Physical AI redefines intelligence as an embodied, interactive process, offering a paradigm shift from classical AI by emphasizing physical experience over abstract computation.

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interlat enables LLM-based agents to communicate via hidden states (latent communication), improving collaboration and efficiency over traditional token-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language limits information depth in LLM-based agent communication, hindering collaboration. The need for richer, nuanced interaction inspired Interlat.

Method: Uses last hidden states of LLMs for direct transmission (latent communication) and adds compression via latent space reasoning.

Result: Interlat outperforms chain-of-thought prompting and single-agent baselines, enhancing exploration and latent info utilization. Compression boosts speed while preserving performance.

Conclusion: Interlat demonstrates feasibility of latent space communication for LLM agents, showing promise for future research.

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

TL;DR: CGAR introduces curriculum learning for architectural depth, training recursive reasoning models faster (1.71x speedup) with minimal accuracy loss (0.63%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training recursive reasoning models is computationally expensive (36 GPU-hours per dataset), limiting adoption. CGAR aims to reduce costs while maintaining performance.

Method: CGAR uses Progressive Depth Curriculum (adjusts recursion depth) and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting (decaying loss weights).

Result: Achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours) with only 0.63% accuracy drop on Sudoku-Extreme. Pareto improvement observed.

Conclusion: Principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive models on modest hardware.

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhyKAN, a physics-informed neural network based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, to replace traditional static basis functions in electromagnetic modeling, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Method of Moments (MoM) uses fixed basis functions (e.g., RWG), limiting adaptability. The paper aims to overcome this by introducing a learnable basis representation inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem.

Method: Proposes PhyKAN, combining a local KAN branch with a global branch embedding Green's function priors, derived from EFIE (Electric Field Integral Equation). This ensures physical consistency while enabling adaptability.

Result: PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors and accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions across canonical geometries.

Conclusion: PhyKAN bridges classical solvers and modern neural networks, offering interpretability and physics-consistent electromagnetic modeling.

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabPFN-2.5 is an advanced tabular foundation model handling larger datasets (up to 50K data points, 2K features) and outperforming competitors like XGBoost and AutoGluon 1.4, with a new distillation engine for practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous models (TabPFN and TabPFNv2) by scaling up capacity and improving performance for larger datasets, while ensuring practical usability in production.

Method: Developed TabPFN-2.5 with expanded capabilities (20x more data cells) and introduced a distillation engine to convert it into lightweight MLP or tree ensembles for deployment.

Result: Outperforms tuned tree-based models and matches AutoGluon 1.4 on TabArena benchmark, with 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small-medium datasets and 87% on larger ones.

Conclusion: TabPFN-2.5 significantly advances tabular AI, offering superior accuracy and deployability, benefiting existing applications and methods in the TabPFN ecosystem.

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

*Can Yang,Zhenzhong Wang,Junyuan Liu,Yunpeng Gong,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEGNet is a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that improves PDE simulations by embedding PDE dynamics into graph neural networks, enhancing stability and physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solvers are computationally expensive, while data-driven methods often lack physical consistency, especially in complex scenarios. PEGNet aims to address these limitations by integrating physics into neural networks.

Method: PEGNet uses PDE-guided message passing and distinct message functions for key dynamics (convection, viscosity, diffusion). It employs hierarchical architecture for multi-scale features and physical regularization in the loss function.

Result: PEGNet outperforms existing methods in benchmarks, including respiratory airflow and drug delivery datasets, showing better long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency.

Conclusion: PEGNet successfully bridges the gap between data-driven methods and physical consistency, offering a promising approach for accurate and efficient PDE simulations.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI integrates human oversight into ML systems to balance accuracy, privacy, and fairness, offering transparent trade-offs and interactive stakeholder input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems impact critical areas like healthcare and hiring, requiring fairness, privacy, and accountability alongside accuracy. Existing methods often fail to balance these competing demands.

Method: FAIRPLAI introduces privacy-fairness frontiers, interactive stakeholder input, and differentially private auditing loops to integrate human judgment into ML design and deployment.

Result: FAIRPLAI preserves privacy while reducing fairness disparities on benchmark datasets, providing a practical solution for balancing accuracy, privacy, and fairness.

Conclusion: FAIRPLAI offers a responsible and trustworthy framework for ML systems by embedding human oversight, addressing real-world challenges effectively.

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

### [157] [Benevolent Dictators? On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08721)
*Andreas Einwiller,Kanishka Ghosh Dastidar,Artur Romazanov,Annette Hautli-Janisz,Michael Granitzer,Florian Lemmerich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LLM-ABS framework to study how system prompts influence LLM agent behavior, highlighting preferences for fairness and prompt sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robustness in previous studies on LLM agent behavior, which often overlook the impact of system prompts.

Method: Proposes the LLM-ABS framework to explore prompt influence, use neutral prompts for reliable insights, and analyze linguistic features.

Result: LLM agents show fairness preferences and prompt sensitivity, with linguistic variations in responses.

Conclusion: The LLM-ABS framework provides a robust foundation for studying LLM agent behavior despite persistent prompt sensitivity.

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

*Mohammed Ali El Adlouni,Ling Jin,Xiaodan Xu,C. Anna Spurlock,Alina Lazar,Kaveh Farokhi Sadabadi,Mahyar Amirgholy,Mona Asudegi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning approach to predict network-wide emission rates using large-scale traffic and emission data, addressing gaps in empirically derived eMFD models for urban congestion and emission reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban congestion leads to inefficiencies and pollution, but existing eMFD models lack empirical data. This study aims to fill that gap by leveraging probe vehicle data.

Method: Machine learning is applied to large-scale, granular traffic and emission data from probe vehicles to predict emission-traffic relationships in U.S. urban areas.

Result: The study produces data-driven eMFDs and insights into how emissions depend on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics.

Conclusion: The framework enables transportation authorities to measure emissions and optimize traffic management to reduce urban congestion and emissions.

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

*Carlos A. Taveras,Santiago Segarra,César A. Uribe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two algorithms, GPC and KGPC, for graph coarsening using Gromov-Wasserstein geometry, showing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve graph coarsening by minimizing distortion during node merging, addressing limitations in current approaches.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed: GPC (greedy merging based on local distortion) and KGPC (clustering-based merging using distortion metrics).

Result: The algorithms outperform existing methods on large-scale datasets and a clustering task, validated under varied scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed GPC and KGPC methods effectively minimize distortion in graph coarsening, offering practical advantages over prior techniques.

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper extends Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) with arithmetic primitives using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC) to enhance neural network expressivity and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to increase the expressivity of neural network states by enabling them to contain structured representations inherently interpretable, aiming for more general intelligent agents.

Method: Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs) are used to extend VSA encoding of Lisp 1.5 with arithmetic primitives via Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC).

Result: The method allows encoding Turing-complete syntax over high-dimensional vector spaces, enhancing neural network states' expressivity and interpretability.

Conclusion: The VSA encoding shows potential for machine learning tasks, emphasizing structured representations and neural network design sensitive to representation structure for advancing general intelligence.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

TL;DR: The paper presents a clear standalone derivation of the bias-variance decomposition generalized for Bregman divergence, filling a pedagogical gap, with added context and references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a clear standalone derivation for the bias-variance decomposition generalized for Bregman divergence, which is useful in maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families.

Method: The authors provide a pedagogical derivation of the generalized bias-variance decomposition for prediction error measured as Bregman divergence.

Result: A clear and standalone derivation of the generalized bias-variance decomposition is presented, accompanied by additional discussion and references to prior literature.

Conclusion: The paper successfully fills a pedagogical gap by offering a standalone derivation of a known result, enhancing understanding and accessibility for the community.

Abstract: The bias-variance decomposition is a central result in statistics and machine learning, but is typically presented only for the squared error. We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

*Ismail Lamaakal,Chaymae Yahyati,Yassine Maleh,Khalid El Makkaoui,Ibrahim Ouahbi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BayesQ is a post-training quantization framework that optimizes quantization under posterior expected loss, outperforming baselines like GPTQ with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance quantization efficiency and accuracy by incorporating uncertainty-guided optimization, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: BayesQ uses a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights, whitens by posterior covariance, designs codebooks for minimal distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack approach. Monte Carlo simulation handles task-aware proxies.

Result: At 3.0/3.5/4.0 bits/weight, BayesQ outperforms GPTQ on ResNet-50 (+1.5/+0.7/+0.3 top-1 points) and BERT-base (+1.1/+0.4/+0.2 GLUE points), with comparable preprocessing cost.

Conclusion: BayesQ successfully reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization, offering a practical and efficient post-training solution.

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

### [163] [Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Characterizing System Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08831)
*Tomoki Koike,Elizabeth Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LyapInf, a physics-informed machine learning method to infer Lyapunov functions from trajectory data without needing system equations, achieving near-maximal stability region estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring stability in complex dynamical systems is critical, especially in aerospace, but existing methods often require explicit system equations, which are rarely available.

Method: LyapInf infers a quadratic Lyapunov function by minimizing the Zubov equation residual using trajectory data, treating the system as a black box.

Result: Numerical tests show LyapInf successfully estimates near-maximal stability regions without relying on system equations.

Conclusion: LyapInf offers a practical, equation-free approach to stability analysis, broadening applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

*Nikunj Gupta,Ludwika Twardecka,James Zachary Hare,Jesse Milzman,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIGER enhances MARL by modeling temporal evolution of agent interactions using dynamic graphs and temporal attention, outperforming baselines in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL approaches overlook temporal evolution of interactions, which is crucial for adaptive coordination.

Method: TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs and uses a temporal attention encoder for time-aware agent embeddings.

Result: TIGER outperforms baselines in task performance and sample efficiency on coordination-intensive benchmarks.

Conclusion: Capturing temporal and structural dependencies jointly improves MARL policy learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

*Xincheng Xu,Thilina Ranbaduge,Qing Wang,Thierry Rakotoarivelo,David Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-PMLF integrates per-sample momentum and low-pass filtering to mitigate DP noise and clipping bias in DPSGD, improving the privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for differentially private training often degrade model accuracy by addressing either noise or bias, but not both simultaneously.

Method: DP-PMLF combines per-sample momentum (to smooth gradients before clipping) and low-pass filtering (to reduce DP noise post-processing).

Result: Theoretical analysis shows improved convergence, and empirical results confirm better privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: DP-PMLF outperforms existing DPSGD variants by addressing noise and bias simultaneously without extra privacy cost.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the expressive power of topological descriptors (Euler characteristic and persistent homology) on graph products, showing persistent homology captures more information than Euler characteristic. It also provides algorithms for computing persistent homology diagrams and validates findings empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the multiscale structural information captured by topological descriptors in relational data, specifically focusing on graph products and their filtrations.

Method: The study considers various filtrations on graph products, characterizes the expressive power of Euler characteristic, and compares it with persistent homology. It also develops algorithms for computing persistent homology diagrams and conducts empirical runtime and graph classification analyses.

Result: Persistent homology descriptors on graph products contain strictly more information than those on individual graphs, unlike Euler characteristic. Algorithms for computing persistent homology diagrams are provided and validated empirically.

Conclusion: The work advances graph persistent descriptors by leveraging product filtrations, demonstrating persistent homology's superior informativeness and practical computational feasibility.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two GNN-agnostic frameworks for graph super-resolution to overcome limitations of existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on brain connectome data and introducing new simulated datasets for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph super-resolution avoids costly HR data acquisition, especially beneficial in resource-limited fields like medicine. Existing GNN-based methods have flaws in structure-awareness and scalability.

Method: Proposes Bi-SR for structure-aware node super-resolution and DEFEND for edge inference via dual graph representations. Evaluated on brain connectome data and simulated datasets.

Result: Both frameworks outperform existing methods across seven topological measures on brain connectome data. Twelve new simulated datasets introduced for benchmarking.

Conclusion: The frameworks advance graph super-resolution by addressing key limitations, demonstrating superior performance and broader applicability through simulated datasets.

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between mechanistic interpretability methods (previously applied to toy models) and real-world Transformer models like GPT-2-small.

Method: Extend SPD with an updated causal importance function for sequential data and a new loss function, applied to Transformer models.

Result: Successfully decomposes a toy induction-head model (recovering the 2-step circuit) and identifies interpretable subcomponents in GPT-2-small (e.g., 'golf' and 'basketball').

Conclusion: SPD can surface interpretable mechanisms in modern models, marking progress toward real-world applicability.

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForeSWE is a probabilistic spatio-temporal model combining deep learning and Gaussian processes to improve SWE forecasting accuracy and uncertainty quantification, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SWE forecasting methods lack spatial/temporal correlation utilization and uncertainty estimates, limiting their usefulness for water management decisions.

Method: ForeSWE integrates deep learning (with attention mechanisms) and Gaussian processes to capture spatio-temporal features and provide uncertainty quantification.

Result: Tested on 512 SNOTEL stations, ForeSWE showed superior forecasting accuracy and prediction intervals compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ForeSWE offers a robust solution for SWE forecasting with practical benefits for water management, including improved accuracy and uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEG-X is a foundation model for EEG analysis, addressing variability and noise challenges with location-based embeddings and noise-aware training, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing variability across EEG datasets and low SNR to improve EEG representation learning.

Method: Introduces location-based channel embedding, noise-aware masking/reconstruction, and DiCT layer for structured feature projection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse tasks and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: EEG-X offers robust, device-agnostic EEG representation learning with broad applicability.

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

*Woosuk Chung,Seokwoo Hong,Wonhyeok Lee,Sangyoon Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed a two-stage deep learning model combining Transformer and 1D CNN for automated sleep staging, incorporating contextual cues and expert event annotations to improve accuracy over PSG-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual sleep staging is time-consuming and inconsistent; existing automated methods lack contextual cues used by human experts.

Method: Combines Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with 1D CNN aggregator, integrating subject-level metadata and expert event annotations (e.g., apneas, arousals).

Result: Outperformed PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745 to 0.8031, micro-F1 0.8774 to 0.9051), with event annotations providing the most significant improvement.

Conclusion: Incorporating clinically meaningful contextual features enhances accuracy and interpretability, aligning with expert practices without additional sensors.

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

*Andrea Cavallo,Ayushman Raghuvanshi,Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri,Elvin Isufi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs) are introduced as deep untrained networks that outperform PCA by capturing detailed covariance spectral patterns and improving stability in low-data settings, achieving results comparable to trained models like VNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like PCA have limitations in capturing low-variance information and are unstable in low-sample regimes. CSTs aim to combine the benefits of PCA and trained models (e.g., VNNs) without requiring labeled data or training.

Method: CSTs use deep untrained networks applying covariance wavelets to input data, creating hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. Filters are localized in the covariance spectrum, and pruning improves efficiency. Theoretical analysis shows reduced sensitivity to covariance estimation errors.

Result: Experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements demonstrate CSTs' stability in low-data settings and comparable or better performance than complex trained models.

Conclusion: CSTs offer a robust, training-free alternative to PCA and trained models, providing stable and expressive covariance-based representations suitable for low-sample regimes.

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

*Oliver Wang,Pengrui Quan,Kang Yang,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces spectral predictability ($\Omega$) as a quick metric to guide model selection in time series forecasting, reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners struggle with the high computational cost of validating multiple forecasting models and the risk of poor performance from choosing the wrong model.

Method: The authors use spectral predictability ($\Omega$) to stratify model performance and validate its effectiveness across 51 models and 28 datasets.

Result: They show that large time series foundation models outperform simpler models when $\Omega$ is high, but this advantage diminishes as $\Omega$ drops.

Conclusion: $\Omega$ serves as a practical, fast filter for model selection, reducing validation costs and highlighting the need for models that perform well on difficult (low-$\Omega$) problems.

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stroke diagnosis methods lack fairness across demographic groups, worsening healthcare disparities. FAST-CAD aims to address this gap.

Method: FAST-CAD uses DAT for demographic-invariant representations and Group-DRO to optimize worst-group risk, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Result: The method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across 12 demographic subgroups.

Conclusion: FAST-CAD advances fair medical AI with practical and theoretical contributions.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

TL;DR: Weaver introduces Kronecker product approximations for efficient spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks, improving computational efficiency and interpretability without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transportation networks require accurate, interpretable, and efficient forecasting models. Current Transformer-based architectures lack computational efficiency and interpretability.

Method: Weaver uses Kronecker product approximations to decompose spatiotemporal attention, introduces Valence Attention for negative edges, and employs a Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning.

Result: Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show Weaver achieves competitive performance with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: Weaver provides an efficient and interpretable solution for spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DIVO, a novel offline RL method using diffusion models, addresses overconservatism by leveraging advantage values for selective action expansion and achieves superior performance on D4RL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value overestimation from OOD actions hinders offline RL performance. Existing diffusion-based methods suffer from excessive conservatism due to indiscriminate regularization.

Method: DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism using advantage values to guide diffusion model training, selectively expanding high-advantage actions and filtering high-return-potential actions.

Result: DIVO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on D4RL benchmarks, especially in AntMaze with sparse rewards, achieving higher average returns.

Conclusion: DIVO effectively balances conservatism and explorability in offline RL, leveraging diffusion models for high-quality sample generation and efficient policy improvement.

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Motivation: Hyperparameter optimization for neural networks on tabular data is challenging due to large search spaces and tuning costs. QIBONN aims to address this by integrating feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified framework.

Result: QIBONN performs competitively against classical tree-based methods and other HPO algorithms on 13 real-world datasets under the same tuning budget.

Conclusion: QIBONN offers an effective quantum-inspired approach for hyperparameter optimization, balancing exploration and exploitation while achieving competitive results.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to accurately reconstruct Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) values for precise identification and removal of backdoor neurons in machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against backdoor attacks suffer from low precision due to inaccurate TAC estimation, necessitating a more accurate approach.

Method: The proposed method formulates minimal perturbations as a convex quadratic optimization problem to surrogate TAC, identifies poisoned classes via small L2 norms, and uses these perturbations for fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet show superior backdoor suppression and high clean accuracy across various attacks and datasets.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms existing defenses by accurately reconstructing TAC and effectively removing backdoors.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite diffusion models surpassing VAEs and GANs as SOTA generative models, the study revisits CVAEs to incorporate desired attributes in images, addressing their known limitations like blurriness and lack of diversity.

Method: The method involves making the variance of the gaussian decoder a learnable parameter during training and using normalizing flows to better estimate the latent space's conditional distribution given labels, contrary to previous assumptions.

Result: The approach reduces the FID by 5% and increases log likelihood by 7.7% compared to prior methods, demonstrating improved image generation.

Conclusion: The study successfully enhances CVAE performance for image generation by introducing learnable variance and better latent space modeling, offering a viable alternative despite newer SOTA models.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Result: Improves expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE.

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE effectively enhances uncertainty estimation for reliable decision-making in downstream tasks.

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Motivation: RCTs for AI tools are costly and slow, hindering timely validation of rapidly emerging models.

Result: Demonstrated high concordance between AI models and reduced enrollment by 46.6%, saving $2.8M.

Conclusion: BRIDGE enables feasible Level I evidence generation for AI model iterations, accelerating cost-effective translation.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing computational challenges of clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds.

Method: Utilizes the $p$-Fréchet map to embed manifold data into lower-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling standard clustering techniques like k-means.

Result: Achieves runtime reductions by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining high clustering accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms intrinsic manifold-based methods in efficiency and accuracy, especially in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Motivation: Training LLMs for autonomous driving faces high computation costs and privacy concerns; Federated Learning offers a collaborative solution without raw data sharing.

Method: FLAD introduces a cloud-edge-vehicle architecture, intelligent parallelized training, and knowledge distillation to leverage distributed multimodal data efficiently.

Result: FLAD prototypes demonstrate superior autonomous driving performance while optimizing resource use and privacy in heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: FLAD opens new possibilities for collaborative autonomous driving model training and knowledge sharing, effectively addressing key challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

*Zhenyuan Huang,Hui Zhang,Wenzhong Tang,Haijun Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSDWC enhances federated learning by integrating causal inference with invariant and variant features, improving generalization and OOD detection, outperforming baselines like FedICON.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of federated learning caused by data distribution differences (covariate and semantic shifts) by leveraging causal inference.

Method: Propose FedSDWC, which models weak causal influence between invariant and variant features to infer causal semantic representations.

Result: FedSDWC outperforms FedICON by 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100, with theoretical bounds linking generalization error to client prior distributions.

Conclusion: FedSDWC effectively handles shifts in data distribution, enhancing federated learning's reliability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stress detection models often exhibit gender bias, especially in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the need for equitable AI solutions.

Method: FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints, adversarial gradient masking, and fairness-constrained meta-updates during meta-training and adaptation.

Result: FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy and reduces Equal Opportunity to 0.06, outperforming five baselines in fairness.

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to analyze semantic drift in GNNs on TAGs proposes Geodesic Aggregation via manifold-aware mechanisms, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear aggregation in GNNs distorts PLM embeddings' non-linear geometry, causing semantic drift; hence, a manifold-aware solution is needed.

Method: Introduces a PCA-based metric for semantic drift and proposes Geodesic Aggregation using log-exp mappings on the unit sphere, implemented as GeoGNN.

Result: GeoGNN mitigates semantic drift and outperforms baselines across datasets and text encoders.

Conclusion: Manifold-aware aggregation, like GeoGNN, preserves semantic fidelity and enhances performance in text-attributed graph learning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

TL;DR: This paper explores feedback augmentation to improve efficiency in interactive preference elicitation (IPE) under sparse human feedback, introducing model-free techniques with competitive performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce human effort in acquiring preferences for personalization systems, addressing inefficiencies in existing dueling bandit algorithms when feedback is sparse.

Method: The paper introduces augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, enhancing the model-free dueling bandit framework.

Result: The prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance in IPE benchmarks like recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for provably efficient IPE in broader applications by leveraging feedback augmentation without relying on rigid parametric models.

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

*Anthony Baez,Wang Zhang,Ziwen Ma,Lam Nguyen,Subhro Das,Luca Daniel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PINN-Proj, a projection method ensuring integral conservation in PINNs, reducing errors significantly and improving convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the violation of physical laws in PINNs due to soft constraints, ensuring conservation of linear and quadratic integrals.

Method: Derived projection formulae via constrained non-linear optimization, applied to PINNs (named PINN-Proj).

Result: PINN-Proj reduced conservation errors by 3-4 orders of magnitude and slightly lowered PDE solution errors.

Conclusion: PINN-Proj is a promising framework for conserving integral quantities in PINNs when tractable solutions exist.

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

*Mingjie Zhao,Zhanpei Huang,Yang Lu,Mengke Li,Yiqun Zhang,Weifeng Su,Yiu-ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to learn customizable distance metrics for categorical attributes, enhancing clustering accuracy by breaking fixed topological relationships and proving compatibility with Euclidean metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships, making clustering challenging. Existing methods assume fixed topological relationships, limiting adaptability and performance.

Method: Breaks intrinsic category ties, learns customizable distance metrics, and ensures compatibility with Euclidean metrics for mixed datasets.

Result: Achieves superior clustering accuracy with an average ranking of 1.25, significantly outperforming the current best method (5.21).

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances clustering flexibility and accuracy, proving effective for categorical and mixed datasets.

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

*Zhongnian Li,Lan Chen,Yixin Xu,Shi Xu,Xinzheng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human-Corrected Labels (HCL) to improve the quality of Vision-Language Model (VLM)-generated labels by strategically correcting discrepancies, reducing noise and labor costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs generate noisy labels lacking error correction, necessitating a method to enhance label quality efficiently.

Method: HCL involves human correction for VLM discrepancies, uses a risk-consistent estimator, and estimates label distribution via conditional probability.

Result: Experiments show HCL improves classification performance and robustness to label noise.

Conclusion: HCL effectively enhances weak supervision by balancing label quality and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

### [193] [Factorization-in-Loop: Proximal Fill-in Minimization for Sparse Matrix Reordering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09093)
*Ziwei Li,Shuzi Niu,Tao Yuan,Huiyuan Li,Wenjia Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce fill-ins in LU factorization of sparse matrices using a learned reordering network, achieving significant reductions in fill-ins and computation time compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill-ins during LU factorization increase memory and computational costs. Traditional methods lack theoretical guarantees between surrogate objectives and the actual fill-in reduction. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A reordering network minimizes the l1 norm of triangular factors to approximate fill-ins. It uses a graph encoder for node scores, reparameterization techniques for permutation matrices, and combines ADMM and proximal gradient descent for optimization.

Result: Experiments on SuiteSparse show reductions of 20% in fill-ins and 17.8% in LU factorization time compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces fill-ins and improves LU factorization efficiency for sparse matrices, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

*Hiro Ishii,Kenta Niwa,Hiroshi Sawada,Akinori Fujino,Noboru Harada,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPM is a novel FL method using second-order optimization, addressing drift in local preconditioners by refining update rules and improving convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior FL methods with second-order optimization suffer from drift in local preconditioners, disrupting convergence, especially in heterogeneous data settings. FedPM aims to mitigate this issue.

Method: FedPM decomposes the ideal second-order update into server-side parameter mixing and client-side local updates, introducing preconditioned mixing to reduce drift.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows superlinear convergence for strongly convex objectives. Experiments confirm FedPM's superior test accuracy over conventional methods.

Conclusion: FedPM effectively leverages second-order optimization in FL, improving convergence and accuracy by addressing local preconditioner drift.

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

### [195] [Cost-Minimized Label-Flipping Poisoning Attack to LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09105)
*Shigeki Kusaka,Keita Saito,Mikoto Kudo,Takumi Tanabe,Akifumi Wachi,Youhei Akimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores theoretical foundations for minimum-cost data poisoning attacks on LLMs during RLHF/DPO alignment by flipping preference labels, deriving bounds on attack cost and proposing a cost-reducing post-processing method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLM vulnerabilities is crucial due to their real-world deployment. While empirical studies exist on data poisoning during RLHF/DPO alignment, theoretical insights are lacking.

Method: The authors frame label-flipping attacks as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, calculating bounds on minimum attack cost and introducing a post-processing technique to reduce flips.

Result: Empirical results show the proposed method significantly lowers poisoning costs, especially when reward model features are low-dimensional relative to dataset size.

Conclusion: The study reveals inherent vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and offers tools to assess robustness against cost-effective poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

*Tim Dudman,Martyn Bull*

TL;DR: TERLA enhances deep reinforcement learning agents for cyber defence by enabling generalisability across varying network topologies and sizes without retraining, using graph neural networks and fixed-size action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents require retraining for different network configurations, limiting real-world applicability. TERLA addresses this by improving adaptability.

Method: TERLA combines heterogeneous graph neural networks for state embedding with a fixed-size action space, applied to PPO agents in realistic environments like CAGE Challenge 4.

Result: TERLA agents match vanilla PPO performance while improving action efficiency and generalisability across diverse network segments.

Conclusion: TERLA successfully bridges the sim-to-real gap, offering scalable and efficient cyber defence without needing retraining for different networks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

### [197] [Practical Global and Local Bounds in Gaussian Process Regression via Chaining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09144)
*Junyi Liu,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A chaining-based framework is proposed for estimating global bounds on extreme values in Gaussian process regression without needing specific input features, improving robustness and tightness for common kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for uncertainty bounds in GPR rely on specific inputs and posterior estimates, limiting robustness and global behavior capture.

Method: A chaining-based framework is introduced, with kernel-specific refinements for RBF and Matérn, avoiding analytical relaxations for tighter bounds. Local uncertainty quantification is also developed using partition diameters.

Result: The method provides tighter bounds than generic approaches and outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances robustness and tightness in uncertainty estimation for GPR, validated empirically.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Shira Lifshitz,Ofir Lindenbaum,Gal Mishne,Ron Meir,Hadas Benisty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GroupFS is an unsupervised feature selection method that identifies and selects meaningful feature groups without predefined partitions or labels, outperforming existing methods across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised FS methods often evaluate features independently or rely on predefined groups, missing meaningful signals from feature interactions. GroupFS addresses this gap by discovering latent groups dynamically.

Method: GroupFS employs a differentiable framework with Laplacian smoothness on feature and sample graphs, plus a group sparsity regularizer, to learn compact, structured representations.

Result: GroupFS outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS methods in clustering tasks across nine benchmarks, selecting feature groups aligned with meaningful patterns.

Conclusion: GroupFS successfully captures latent feature groups and enhances unsupervised FS performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability across varied datasets.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hessian-matching method to build compact memory for logistic regression in continual learning, significantly outperforming Experience Replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning struggles to match batch training performance due to catastrophic forgetting. Current methods lack clear solutions for building compact memory.

Method: Proposes Hessian-matching based on Khan and Swaroop's optimal memory existence proof, using probabilistic PCA for estimation.

Result: Achieves 60%-74% accuracy on Split-ImageNet, outperforming Experience Replay (30%) and nearing batch training accuracy (77.6%).

Conclusion: The method advances compact memory construction for continual learning, with potential future applications in deep learning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

*Guojian Wang,Quinson Hon,Xuyang Chen,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFDT improves cross-domain policy adaptation by fusing target data with selectively trusted source fragments using MMD and OT filters, replacing RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, and applying a Q-guided regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-domain policy adaptation struggle with poor stitchability of trajectory fragments, misaligned state structures, and discontinuous RTG tokens, compromising DT's inference ability.

Method: DFDT employs a two-level data filter (MMD for state-structure alignment and OT for action feasibility), trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution, replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, and uses a Q-guided regularizer.

Result: DFDT outperforms baselines in return and stability across domain shifts (gravity, kinematic, morphology) on D4RL-style tasks, confirmed by token-stitching and sequence-semantics analyses.

Conclusion: DFDT effectively addresses stitchability challenges in cross-domain DT policies, improving performance and stability through innovative data fusion and regularization techniques.

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

### [201] [FSampler: Training Free Acceleration of Diffusion Sampling via Epsilon Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09180)
*Michael A. Vladimir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing function evaluations through epsilon prediction and validation, achieving significant time and model call reductions while maintaining fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of diffusion sampling without altering the underlying sampler formulas, reducing computational costs.

Method: FSampler maintains a history of denoising signals, predicts future signals using finite difference predictors, validates predictions, and integrates with various samplers.

Result: FSampler reduces time by 8-22% and model calls by 15-25% at high fidelity (SSIM 0.95-0.99), and up to 45-50% fewer calls at lower fidelity.

Conclusion: FSampler is an effective, training-free solution for accelerating diffusion sampling without compromising fidelity.

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

*Philipp Dingfelder,Christian Riess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges in detecting AI-generated text, highlighting issues with benchmark datasets like DetectRL and proposing cleansing methods to improve detector robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing benchmark datasets for AI-generated text detection, which often contain simplistic patterns that detectors exploit as shortcuts.

Method: Reprocessing the DetectRL dataset through cleansing operations to remove predictable patterns and improve dataset quality.

Result: Cleansed data makes direct spoofing attacks on detectors more difficult, enhancing their robustness.

Conclusion: Improving dataset quality through cleansing operations is crucial for developing reliable AI-generated text detectors.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

*Tianle Pu,Jianing Li,Yingying Gao,Shixuan Liu,Zijie Geng,Haoyang Liu,Chao Chen,Changjun Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoCo-MILP improves MILP solving by addressing misalignments in existing GNN methods with contrastive loss and competitive GNN layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods for MILP solving misalign with MILP's intrinsic structure, neglecting variable priority and competitive relationships within constraints.

Method: Introduces Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL) and Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layers to model contrast and competition.

Result: CoCo-MILP reduces the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: CoCo-MILP demonstrates superior performance in MILP solution prediction by better aligning with problem structure.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCMax, a fully parameter-free clustering framework using self-supervised consensus maximization to determine the optimal number of clusters hierarchically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods rely on hyperparameters, limiting real-world applicability. SCMax aims to eliminate this dependency for broader usability.

Method: SCMax integrates hierarchical agglomerative clustering and evaluation via self-supervised learning and nearest neighbor consensus scoring during agglomeration.

Result: Experiments show SCMax outperforms existing methods in scenarios with unknown cluster counts.

Conclusion: SCMax provides a robust, parameter-free solution for clustering challenges, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining Feynman-Kac (FK) steering with diffusion-based protein design to guide sampling toward specific functional objectives while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based models struggle to steer protein generation toward specific biochemical objectives like binding affinity or sequence composition.

Method: The authors extend FK steering to diffusion-based protein design, coupling it with structure generation and refining rewards through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation.

Result: Applied to binder design, FK steering improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with low computational overhead.

Conclusion: FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary objectives, offering a model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

TL;DR: PlanB&B, a model-based RL agent, improves MILP solving by leveraging learned B&B dynamics for better branching strategies, outperforming existing RL methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance efficiency in solving MILP problems by moving beyond static heuristics and adapting RL techniques for dynamic branching strategies.

Method: Introduces PlanB&B, a model-based RL agent that uses a learned internal model of B&B dynamics and leverages MCTS-inspired planning.

Result: PlanB&B outperforms previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates the potential of MBRL for improving branching strategies in MILP solutions.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

TL;DR: A distributed GNN-based framework improves accuracy and scalability for combinatorial optimization on large graphs by partitioning, local training, and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods struggle with accuracy and scalability on complex graphs due to memory constraints.

Method: Large graphs are partitioned into subgraphs for local training, followed by reinforcement learning to handle cross-node restrictions.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in solution quality and efficiency, validated on social networks and synthetic graphs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses scalability and accuracy limitations in large-scale combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods struggle with Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training on mixed-difficulty samples, and CoT data is labor-intensive. Curriculum learning faces issues like difficulty mismatch and forgetting.

Method: AdaCuRL integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation and adaptive curriculum scheduling, aligning data difficulty with model capability. It includes data revisitation and adaptive reference/sparse KL strategies.

Result: AdaCuRL shows significant performance improvements on LLMs and MLLMs across diverse reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL effectively addresses key challenges in RL for LLMs, offering a robust solution for adaptive curriculum learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand conditions for the emergence of structured internal representations in predictive coding.

Method: Empirical and theoretical analysis using deep networks and multi-step prediction horizons in abstract and complex settings.

Result: Deep networks with multi-step prediction recover latent structures; insights extend to nonlinear cases and diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Predictive coding reliably induces structured representations under specific conditions, linking theory and practice.

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-Facet Attack (DFA) targeting both utility and fairness in federated learning, proposes GuardFed defense, and shows its effectiveness against DFAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning defenses fail against attacks simultaneously degrading utility and fairness, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: The authors propose DFA (including S-DFA and Sp-DFA variants) and GuardFed, a defense framework using trust scores for selective aggregation.

Result: GuardFed outperforms existing defenses in maintaining accuracy and fairness under adversarial and non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: GuardFed is an effective solution against dual-facet attacks, advancing robust federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

*Helena Monke,Benjamin Fresz,Marco Bernreuther,Yilin Chen,Marco F. Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RENTT proposes an exact and efficient method to transform neural networks into decision trees, addressing issues of faithfulness and scalability while providing ground truth feature importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks' opacity and lack of trustworthiness hinder their use. Explainable AI methods often fail to provide faithful explanations. Transforming neural networks into decision trees is a promising solution, but existing methods lack exactness and scalability.

Method: The paper introduces RENTT, a novel algorithm that transforms neural networks (including CNNs, RNNs, and non-ReLU activations) into exact decision tree representations efficiently. It also provides methods to calculate feature importance globally, regionally, and locally.

Result: RENTT is computationally efficient, scalable, and outperforms approximation methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) in uncovering ground truth explanations. Numerical experiments support these claims.

Conclusion: RENTT effectively addresses the limitations of existing explainable AI methods by providing exact, scalable, and interpretable decision tree representations of neural networks, enhancing trustworthiness.

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. All code is available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/RENTT .

TL;DR: Proposes Tensor Circuit Neural Network (TCNN) combining tensor neural networks and residual circuit models for improved generalization, robustness, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of reducing neural network complexity while maintaining generalization and robustness, surpassing limitations of conventional methods.

Method: Integrates tensor neural networks with residual circuits, introduces activation operations and parallelism in complex fields, and adds an information fusion layer.

Result: TCNN achieves 2%-3% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art models, shows resilience to noise attacks, and maintains efficiency in parameters and runtime.

Conclusion: TCNN's design, including activation, parallelism, and fusion layers, enhances generalization and robustness, making it superior to existing methods.

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that reduces activation memory overhead in LLMs by selectively activating only the most relevant channels per token, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling paradigms for LLMs lead to high memory overhead, with FFN activations being a major bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is used. This work aims to address this issue by optimizing activation memory usage.

Method: The authors propose MoC, a new FFN architecture that leverages SwiGLU's gating mechanism to activate only the Top-K most relevant channels per token. This reduces activation memory during pre-training and enhances inference efficiency via partial weight loading.

Result: Experiments show that MoC achieves significant reductions in activation memory and improvements in throughput while maintaining competitive model performance.

Conclusion: MoC effectively mitigates the activation memory bottleneck in LLMs, offering a practical solution for improving efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

TL;DR: MARBLE extends RMABs to nonstationary environments using latent Markov states, introducing MAI criterion and QWI for optimal policy convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical RMABs assume fixed dynamics, but real-world environments are often nonstationary. MARBLE addresses this gap by incorporating latent Markov states.

Method: MARBLE augments RMABs with latent Markov states, introducing MAI criterion and synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) for policy learning.

Result: QWI converges almost surely to optimal Q-function and Whittle indices under MAI. Empirical validation shows QWI adapts to shifting latent states effectively.

Conclusion: MARBLE successfully handles nonstationary environments, with MAI and QWI ensuring optimal policy convergence, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

*Alexander Nadel,Ron Wettenstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WOODELF is a unified SHAP algorithm integrating decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic for efficient computation of SHAP values, offering significant speedups compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient and scalable SHAP calculation methods to interpret decision tree ensembles, which are widely used in various domains.

Method: WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula for each consumer, combining feature values, tree structure, and background data, enabling linear-time computation of Background SHAP and other game-theoretic values.

Result: WOODELF achieves 16x and 165x speedups on CPU and GPU, respectively, compared to existing methods, as demonstrated on a large dataset.

Conclusion: WOODELF provides a fast, scalable, and hardware-agnostic solution for SHAP computation, making it practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

*Rüveyda Yilmaz,Julian Thull,Johannes Stegmaier,Volkmar Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using conditional diffusion models to interpolate missing data in PET imaging sinograms, enabling flexible detector designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET imaging often faces challenges with incomplete sinograms due to unconventional detector layouts like walk-through designs or long-axial rings. Traditional methods constrain hardware, but this work explores data-driven solutions.

Method: The study employs conditional diffusion models to learn and interpolate missing lines-of-response in undersampled sinograms.

Result: The approach enables cost-efficient and patient-friendly PET imaging geometries without requiring complete detector cylinders.

Conclusion: Conditional diffusion models offer a viable solution for handling missing data in PET imaging, supporting innovative detector layouts.

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

### [220] [Potent but Stealthy: Rethink Profile Pollution against Sequential Recommendation via Bi-level Constrained Reinforcement Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09392)
*Jiajie Su,Zihan Nan,Yunshan Ma,Xiaobo Xia,Xiaohua Feng,Weiming Liu,Xiaolin Zheng,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREAT, a constrained reinforcement-driven attack method for sequential recommenders, addressing limitations of existing Profile Pollution Attacks by balancing adversarial efficacy and stealthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on sequential recommenders lack practicality due to large-scale requirements or fake profiles. Profile Pollution Attacks (PPA) are explored but suffer from over-reliance on sequence horizon impact and detectable distribution shifts.

Method: CREAT uses a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning. It includes a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy (integrating pattern inversion and distribution consistency rewards) and Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning (using dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay).

Result: Extensive experiments show CREAT effectively balances adversarial efficacy and stealthiness in targeted pollution attacks.

Conclusion: CREAT successfully addresses PPA limitations, providing a practical and stealthy adversarial attack method for sequential recommenders.

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

TL;DR: AGT introduces Abstract Gradient Training, a framework for certifying model robustness against training data perturbations like adversarial poisoning, data removal, and differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on inference-time perturbations, leaving training data perturbations under-studied despite their importance in adversarial poisoning, unlearning, and privacy.

Method: AGT uses parameter-space bounds to certify robustness for models trained via first-order optimization, addressing bounded perturbations, data removal, and additions.

Result: AGT provides formal guarantees for model behavior under training data perturbations.

Conclusion: AGT fills a gap by offering a unified framework for certifying robustness against training data perturbations.

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CallosumNet is a framework for efficient spatio-temporal graph unlearning, addressing privacy concerns with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA require complete unlearning of unauthorized data in spatio-temporal graphs, but existing methods are inefficient.

Method: CallosumNet uses Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC) and Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB) to divide-and-conquer the unlearning problem.

Result: CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses privacy challenges in spatio-temporal graphs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

*Jiao Chen,Weihua Li,Jianhua Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Probing then Editing (PTE), a retain-free unlearning framework for IIoT environments, addressing outdated knowledge without relying on retained data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational burdens and privacy issues in existing methods that require retained data for unlearning.

Method: PTE uses a probe-edit process with gradient ascent and push-pull optimization to edit knowledge efficiently.

Result: PTE effectively balances unlearning and model utility on benchmarks like CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Conclusion: PTE offers a privacy-compliant and efficient solution for knowledge unlearning in IIoT.

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

TL;DR: TSGP is a semantic GP approach using transformers to generate diverse offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity, outperforming other methods on symbolic regression tasks while balancing exploration and exploitation via target semantic distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of fixed syntactic transformations in semantic GP by leveraging transformer models for semantic-driven program generation, ensuring diverse yet semantically similar solutions.

Method: TSGP employs a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to create offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to parents, trained on millions of programs for generalization.

Result: TSGP outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP on 24 datasets, achieving an average rank of 1.58 and producing compact solutions. The target semantic distance ($σ_t$) effectively balances exploration and exploitation.

Conclusion: TSGP demonstrates superior performance in symbolic regression by leveraging transformer models for semantic diversity and control, offering a practical balance between fitness improvement and program compactness.

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand neural networks' advantages by simplifying analysis with adaptive feature programs and FEM.

Method: Uses over-parametrized sequence models and introduces FEM to evaluate feature learning quality in various adaptive feature models.

Result: Shows FEM decreases during training in models like linear regression and single/multiple index models, supporting the adaptive feature program.

Conclusion: The adaptive feature program shows promise for understanding neural networks, supported by empirical evidence of FEM reduction.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

TL;DR: Incorporating group symmetries into sparse autoencoders improves their performance in interpreting data with symmetries, such as scientific images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance sparse autoencoders' effectiveness in domains beyond language, particularly for data with group symmetries like scientific images.

Method: The authors train autoencoders on synthetic images and introduce adaptively equivariant SAEs that adjust to the base model's equivariance level.

Result: Adaptive SAEs outperform regular SAEs in discovering features that improve downstream probing performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating symmetries into mechanistic interpretability tools like SAEs enhances their utility for interpretable feature discovery.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in graph ML under personalization and privacy constraints, leveraging LLMs for improved performance.

Method: Combines data augmentation, prompt/instruction tuning, and in-context learning within a Bayesian variational framework for federated learning.

Result: Supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings, with cross-modal regularization aligning LLM and graph representations.

Conclusion: The method is effective for federated graph tasks, with applications in knowledge graphs, recommendations, and more, while ensuring privacy.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

TL;DR: The study compares statistical, ML, and DL models for traffic speed and flow forecasting using PeMS data, finding ANFIS-GP best for short-term and Bi-LSTM for medium-term predictions. Hybrid models are suggested for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic congestion due to urbanization necessitates ITS solutions like traffic forecasting for proactive management using existing infrastructure.

Method: Evaluated statistical, ML, and DL models (e.g., ANFIS-GP, Bi-LSTM) over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1h40m) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics on PeMS data.

Result: ANFIS-GP excelled early (RMSE 0.038, MAE 0.0276, R-Square 0.9983); Bi-LSTM was robust medium-term (RMSE 0.1863, MAE 0.0833, R-Square 0.987). Hybrid models proposed.

Conclusion: Hybrid models show promise for future traffic forecasting, balancing short and medium-term prediction strengths.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transparent framework combining global explanations and feature mapping to improve interpretability in predicting solar energetic particle (SEP) events, validated with historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SEP prediction models lack transparency, making it hard for physicists to understand the underlying physics behind predictions.

Method: A novel framework integrating global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping enhances model transparency and decision-making insights.

Result: Validated with 341 SEP events (244 significant proton events), the method improves explainability and physics-informed understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the interpretability challenge in SEP event prediction, aiding solar physicists.

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

TL;DR: SOLIS learns an evaluation-aligned embedding space using supervised contrastive learning for planning, reducing it to vector operations. Demonstrated in chess, it achieves competitive strength with shallow search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether planning can be directly performed in learned representations aligned with outcomes, offering a lightweight alternative to traditional methods.

Method: SOLIS uses supervised contrastive learning to create an embedding space where outcome similarity is proximity-based and a global advantage vector orients planning.

Result: SOLIS achieves competitive performance in chess with shallow search, indicating feasibility of evaluation-aligned latent planning.

Conclusion: Evaluation-aligned latent planning is a promising lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

*Junqi Gao,Zhichang Guo,Dazhi Zhang,Yao Li,Yi Ran,Biqing Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PDAC and SPDAC, efficient coreset selection methods for CL by prioritizing high-probability-density samples, reducing computational cost and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coreset selection methods in CL are computationally expensive due to iterative optimization, prompting a need for more efficient alternatives.

Method: Analyzes MSE decomposition, identifies high-density samples' role in error suppression, and introduces PDAC (density-prioritized selection) and SPDAC (adapted for streaming data).

Result: PDAC and SPDAC outperform baselines in CL settings with better efficiency.

Conclusion: Prioritizing high-density samples in coreset selection enhances CL performance and efficiency, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data curation for SFT is expensive, and existing automated methods require labeled datasets, posing challenges for subjective tasks.

Method: AutoSynth reframes the problem as Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a dataset-free hybrid reward, using LLM-as-judge components for meta-learning.

Result: AutoSynth-generated data outperforms baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and matches expert workflows on some metrics, reducing human effort by 90%.

Conclusion: AutoSynth provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for subjective LLM tasks, addressing the cold start problem.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

TL;DR: Proposed second-order deterministic actor-critic framework uses curvature info for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend deterministic policy gradient methods to exploit performance function curvature for better efficiency.

Method: Introduce quadratic critic preserving true gradient & Hessian approximation; use least-squares TD learning.

Result: Quasi-Newton actor update enables faster convergence than first-order methods.

Conclusion: Method improves convergence & performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.
