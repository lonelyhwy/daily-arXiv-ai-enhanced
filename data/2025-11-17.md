### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops an analytic framework to test conditions for runaway AI growth, linking capability escalation to resource limits and deriving actionable safety controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace speculation with measurable conditions and practical controls for certifying or preventing unbounded AI capability growth.

Method: An analytic framework coupling capability growth to resource build-out, using physical and information-theoretic limits to define growth boundaries.

Result: Derives decision rules for runaway vs. nonsingular behavior and proposes implementable safety controls like power caps and throttling.

Conclusion: Provides testable conditions and deployable controls to address AI singularity risks, grounded in observable metrics and practical limitations.

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance in seconds, outperforming existing methods by 2,500x to 400,000x in speed on models like Stable Diffusion and MSCOCO.

Conclusion: This work advances the practical application of data attribution in large-scale models, significantly improving speed and scalability.

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces ColoWorkflow, a consensus-based video-based assessment tool for analyzing workflows in minimally invasive colorectal surgery, demonstrating moderate inter-rater reliability and potential for standardizing training and improving surgical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery faces challenges like procedural variability and a steep learning curve, impacting quality and outcomes. Existing workflow analysis tools lack standardization and ease of implementation.

Method: A Delphi process was used to develop consensus on workflow descriptors, leading to the creation of ColoWorkflow. The tool was applied to a multicentre video dataset of colorectal surgeries, and its applicability and inter-rater reliability were assessed.

Result: Consensus was reached on 10 phases and 34 steps describing colorectal surgery workflows. ColoWorkflow showed broad applicability (used in 54 videos) and moderate inter-rater reliability (mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases, 0.66 for steps).

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow provides a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking and supporting AI-driven workflow recognition. It may standardize training and improve surgical quality.

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

TL;DR: GFT introduces a point-cloud-specific PEFT method using dynamic graphs and lightweight modules, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To further reduce the computational and memory costs of fine-tuning for point cloud data, as general PEFT methods are suboptimal.

Method: Learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs using a lightweight graph convolution network, integrating features via skip connections and cross-attention.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in object classification and segmentation with fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: GFT offers an efficient and effective fine-tuning solution for point cloud tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing LRP-based approaches in preserving accuracy with limited data.

Conclusion: The study presents an improved LRP-based pruning method effective for environments with constrained resources and data.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial but faces issues like unbalanced categories, complex dynamic facial actions, and modal heterogeneity.

Result: Improves Weighted F1 scores by 3.42% and 5.73% on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: MCN-CL effectively tackles modal heterogeneity and category imbalance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Conclusion: YOLO-Drone is a high-performance solution for drone-based object detection, offering significant accuracy and speed improvements.

Abstract: Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The results confirmed that the proposed model outperformed YOLOv8 by 0.1% in mAP (0.5) and surpassed YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.

*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin is a phase-window search algorithm for efficient and faithful attribution in object-level foundation models, achieving near-linear complexity and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing submodular subset selection methods for attribution are faithful but inefficient, limiting practical deployment.

Method: PhaseWin introduces phased coarse-to-fine search with adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision.

Result: PhaseWin achieves 95% of greedy faithfulness with only 20% computational cost and outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: PhaseWin sets a new standard for scalable, high-faithfulness attribution in multimodal object-level models.

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

### [11] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)
*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision for OOD detection, leveraging vision-language models and large language models to improve performance by focusing on inter-class features and optimizing prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current OOD detection methods using negative prompts, which often capture overlapping or misleading information, the authors aim to enhance performance by focusing on inter-class features and optimizing prompt representations.

Method: The approach involves initializing class-specific positive and negative prompts with LLMs, optimizing these prompts to focus on intra-class features and category boundaries, and using a graph-based architecture to propagate semantic-aware supervision to the visual modality for improved OOD detection.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmarks like CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K across eight OOD datasets and five LLMs.

Conclusion: Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision effectively enhances OOD detection by optimizing prompts and leveraging semantic knowledge, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates lightweight YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n models for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in real-world environments, showing YOLOv12n's superior sensitivity and YOLOv11n's higher precision, balancing performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of FER in unconstrained environments by testing lightweight YOLO models for their adaptability and performance.

Method: The study converts FER2013 and KDEF datasets into object detection format and evaluates model performance using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

Result: YOLOv12n achieves higher mAP (95.6 on KDEF, 63.8 on FER2013), while YOLOv11n shows higher precision (65.2) on FER2013, with both models performing better on cleaner datasets.

Conclusion: Lightweight YOLO models effectively balance sensitivity and precision, making them suitable for real-time, resource-constrained FER applications.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [13] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD) is proposed to address challenges in transferring knowledge between Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet18 by aligning complementary features and introducing Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) for diverse knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation methods in handling heterogeneous architectures, which often struggle with spatial feature disparities and computational inefficiency.

Method: HCD integrates teacher and student features via a Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM), decomposes shared logits into sub-logits using SDD, and employs Orthogonality Loss (OL) to ensure diversity.

Result: HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods on datasets like CIFAR-100, CUB200, and ImageNet-1K, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: HCD effectively bridges the gap in heterogeneous KD by leveraging complementary features and diverse knowledge transfer, offering a simpler yet powerful solution compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

*Xingyue Zhao,Wenke Huang,Xingguang Wang,Haoyu Zhao,Linghao Zhuang,Anwen Jiang,Guancheng Wan,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedBCS addresses feature heterogeneity in federated medical learning by introducing domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment and style recalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols poses a challenge in federated learning for medical data. Existing methods fail to capture multi-level cues and overlook style biases in intermediate layers.

Method: Proposes FedBCS, which uses frequency-domain style recalibration and dual-level prototype alignment to decouple content-style representations and align domain-invariant prototypes.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the method achieves remarkable performance.

Conclusion: FedBCS effectively bridges feature representation gaps and improves model robustness by addressing limitations in contextual learning and style bias accumulation.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

TL;DR: SandboxVLM improves VLMs' 3D reasoning by using abstract bounding boxes, enhancing spatial cognition without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with 3D tasks due to modality gaps from 2D training, limiting real-world applications like robotics.

Method: Introduces SandboxVLM, a framework with a 4-stage pipeline for 3D reconstruction and perception via bounding boxes.

Result: Achieves an 8.3% gain on SAT Real benchmark, improving spatial intelligence in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: SandboxVLM enhances VLMs' 3D reasoning, enabling better embodied intelligence without additional training.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM improves micro expression recognition by disentangling motion semantics and aligning text with facial motion, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro expression recognition (MER) is essential for genuine emotion inference, but existing methods struggle with entangled cues and misaligned textual labels.

Method: Proposes DEFT-LLM with motion-driven instruction dataset (Uni-MER) and multi-expert architecture to decouple facial dynamics into interpretable representations.

Result: Achieves top performance on MER benchmarks and excels in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM effectively aligns motion semantics and leverages MLLMs for precise capture of subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

*Wenrui Li,Wei Han,Hengyu Man,Wangmeng Zuo,Xiaopeng Fan,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LGRLN, a novel video summarization method using language-guided graph representation learning to address challenges like capturing global dependencies and multimodal customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with global dependencies and multimodal customization in video summarization. Temporal proximity doesn't always align with semantic proximity, prompting a need for a better solution.

Method: LGRLN uses a video graph generator to structure frames into graphs (forward, backward, undirected), an intra-graph relational reasoning module with dual-threshold graph convolution, and a language-guided cross-modal embedding module.

Result: LGRLN outperforms existing methods on benchmarks, reduces inference time by 87.8%, and cuts model parameters by 91.7%.

Conclusion: The proposed LGRLN effectively addresses video summarization challenges, offering improved performance, efficiency, and customization.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

TL;DR: TG-DFER is a text-guided weakly supervised framework enhancing MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling, improving generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of visual diversity and temporal complexity in dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) under weak supervision.

Method: Incorporates a vision-language pre-trained model for semantic guidance, visual prompts for alignment, and a multi-grained temporal network for capturing dynamics.

Result: Demonstrates improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity in DFER tasks.

Conclusion: TG-DFER effectively mitigates the limitations of MIL-based approaches by leveraging semantic and temporal modeling.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMoE is a sparse MoE transformer that improves routing stability and expert utilization by reparameterizing experts in an orthonormal eigenbasis and using cosine similarity for routing, achieving top performance without balancing losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses issues in MoE architectures like misaligned routing, unstable utilization, and load imbalances, which weaken specialization and performance.

Method: Reparameterizes experts in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with cosine similarity-based Eigenbasis Scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet, cross-modal retrieval benchmarks, and improves brain age prediction by over 7%.

Conclusion: ERMoE offers a scalable, interpretable solution for MoE routing challenges, enhancing performance and specialization.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

*Haoran Chen,Houze Xu,Micah Goldblum,Daoguo Dong,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMC and DMC-OT are two-stage frameworks for CLIP-based class-incremental learning, addressing classifier bias and distributional drift via decoupled modality adaptation and optimal-transport calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending vision-language models like CLIP to continual learning without forgetting prior knowledge is challenging due to classifier bias and distributional drift.

Method: DMC decouples vision encoder adaptation and textual soft prompt optimization, while DMC-OT adds optimal-transport calibration for memory statistics alignment.

Result: DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, with DMC-OT improving accuracy by 1.80% on average.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks effectively address key challenges in CLIP-based continual learning, enhancing adaptability and stability.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency due to frame timing shifts. The paper introduces Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS) to stabilize attention by smoothing temporal kernels without altering positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address temporal instability in Video LLMs caused by multimodal RoPE extensions, which disrupt attention dynamics.

Method: Proposes PAS, a training-free method that applies opposed phase offsets across heads and aggregates outputs to smooth the temporal kernel.

Result: PAS improves temporal consistency in Video LLMs across benchmarks with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: PAS offers a simple, effective solution for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

TL;DR: A training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision using VLMs involves quantization and binarization steps, improving accuracy across tasks like REC and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance zero-shot vision performance without task-specific training by simplifying open-ended queries into quantized MCQs and binary True/False questions.

Method: Quantization converts open-ended queries into MCQs with explicit candidates; binarization resolves these via True/False questions, selecting the candidate deterministically.

Result: The workflow significantly improves accuracy across tasks like REC and spatial reasoning, showing generality and a consistent boost over direct open-ended queries.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow offers a practical, unified approach for stronger zero-shot vision with VLMs, emphasizing inference-time design over training.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HPAC, a lightweight autoregressive model for lossless image compression, using hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation to achieve practical, state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are often seen as impractical due to high computational costs. This work aims to make them practical and efficient while maintaining top performance.

Method: HPAC uses hierarchical parallelism, content-aware convolutional gating, Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), and Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT).

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art compression across diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) with competitive coding speeds and small parameter count.

Conclusion: Carefully designed autoregressive frameworks can outperform existing methods, offering practical and efficient lossless compression.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLUE is a generative model framework for diverse and stable image generation using fixed-format prompts without extra data, outperforming baselines on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized fields like medicine lack diverse and sufficient data for text-to-image synthesis, limiting existing methods. CLUE aims to address this gap.

Method: Based on Stable Diffusion, CLUE uses a Style Encoder and second attention layer in U-Net, with KL divergence for continuous latent space representation.

Result: CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). Synthetic data boosted classifier performance significantly.

Conclusion: CLUE effectively generates diverse and stable images from limited datasets, proving useful for domain-specific data augmentation.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE is a novel multimodal framework using prompt-attentive hierarchical contrastive learning to improve robustness in scenarios with missing modalities, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models degrade when modalities are missing due to inconsistent representation learning, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: PROMISE integrates multimodal prompt learning and a prompt-attention mechanism within hierarchical contrastive learning to handle missing modalities.

Result: Experimental results show PROMISE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance.

Conclusion: PROMISE effectively bridges the representational gap between complete and incomplete multimodal data.

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation systems overlook affective dimensions, focusing only on low-level visual metrics. Emotion analysis lacks dedicated resources for generative tasks, especially in stylized contexts.

Method: Introduces EmoVid, a dataset with emotion labels, visual attributes, and captions. Analyzes spatial-temporal emotion-visual patterns and fine-tunes Wan2.1 for emotion-conditioned video generation.

Result: Significant improvement in quantitative metrics and visual quality for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks.

Conclusion: EmoVid advances affective video computing, offering insights into visual emotion analysis and practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

TL;DR: DnR is a framework that measures and improves LVLMs' reliance on visual evidence to reduce hallucinations and ungrounded responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce ungrounded responses due to over-reliance on linguistic priors, lacking a way to quantify visual utilization.

Method: Proposes Draft and Refine (DnR), using a question-conditioned utilization metric and external visual experts for iterative refinement.

Result: Shows accuracy gains and reduced hallucination in VQA and captioning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Measuring visual utilization improves grounding and interpretability in multimodal systems without retraining.

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'visual processing bottleneck' in VLMs by incorporating human-like memory mechanisms.

Method: Introduces VisMem, featuring dynamic latent vision memories—short-term for perceptual retention and long-term for semantic consolidation—invoked during inference.

Result: Achieves an 11.8% average performance boost across diverse visual benchmarks, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: VisMem establishes a new paradigm for memory enhancement in VLMs, improving perceptual and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns over harmful content creation by diffusion-based T2I models, SP-Guard aims to enhance safety through adaptive and selective guidance.

Method: SP-Guard estimates prompt harmfulness and uses a selective guidance mask to target only unsafe image areas during generation.

Result: Experiments show SP-Guard generates safer images than current methods, with fewer unintended alterations.

Conclusion: SP-Guard advances safer image generation, emphasizing transparency and controllability.

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

TL;DR: SUPER (Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction) enhances U-Net variants by leveraging wavelet perfect reconstruction to prevent information loss and suppress redundancy, improving high-frequency detail recovery without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current U-Net variants for inverse problems suffer from information loss, especially in high-frequency details like thin cracks, prompting the need for a method that preserves these details while eliminating redundancy.

Method: SUPER integrates wavelet perfect reconstruction to avoid degradation and selectively suppresses redundant features, acting as a plug-and-play decoder block compatible with various U-Net architectures.

Result: SUPER improves thin-crack segmentation (narrower than 4 px) in CrackVision12K and shows moderate PSNR gains in low-frequency smartphone denoising (SIDD), validating its robustness across frequency regimes.

Conclusion: SUPER provides a versatile, reconstruction-aware solution that enhances high-frequency fidelity and global coherence in U-Net variants, demonstrating broad applicability and performance gains.

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

TL;DR: AirCopBench is introduced as the first benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-drone collaborative perception under degraded conditions, revealing performance gaps and sim-to-real transfer feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of MLLMs in complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under degraded perception conditions, which multi-drone systems address better than single-agent setups.

Method: AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions from simulator and real-world data, covering four task dimensions and 14 task types, constructed using degraded-perception scenarios and collaborative events. Questions are generated via model-, rule-, and human-based methods with quality control.

Result: Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average, and inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning confirms sim-to-real transfer feasibility.

Conclusion: AirCopBench fills a critical gap in evaluating MLLMs for collaborative aerial perception, highlighting current limitations and potential for improvement through sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

### [32] [EmbryoDiff: A Conditional Diffusion Framework with Multi-Focal Feature Fusion for Fine-Grained Embryo Developmental Stage Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11027)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework, EmbryoDiff, improves embryo stage classification by leveraging multi-focal features and hybrid semantic-boundary cues, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained identification of embryo stages in IVF is vital for viability assessment. Existing models ignore developmental priors and rely on incomplete single-focal information.

Method: EmbryoDiff uses a two-stage approach: a frozen frame-level encoder extracts multi-focal features, and a fusion strategy combines these into a 3D-aware representation. A hybrid semantic-boundary block injects cues into a diffusion process for denoising.

Result: The model achieves 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on benchmark datasets with just one denoising step, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff addresses prior limitations by integrating multi-focal features and hybrid conditions, offering robust and accurate embryo stage classification.

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep vision models trained on chest X-rays can predict socioeconomic status from seemingly normal images, challenging the neutrality of medical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover how AI models detect unintended social inequalities encoded in medical images, revealing biases that traditional medicine overlooked.

Method: State-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) were trained on chest X-rays to predict health insurance type, controlling for age, race, and sex. Patch-based occlusion identified diffuse signals in thoracic regions.

Result: Models achieved significant accuracy (AUC ~0.67-0.68) in predicting socioeconomic status, with signals persisting across racial groups and clinical conditions.

Conclusion: Medical images encode hidden social fingerprints, requiring fairness in AI to address biases embedded in clinical data, not just dataset imbalances.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

### [34] [Accelerating Controllable Generation via Hybrid-grained Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11031)
*Lin Liu,Huixia Ben,Shuo Wang,Jinda Lu,Junxiang Qiu,Shengeng Tang,Yanbin Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) to improve efficiency in controllable generative models by combining coarse-grained (block-level) and fine-grained (prompt-level) cache strategies, reducing computation costs by 63% with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the low generation efficiency in controllable generative models due to computational demands of handling control conditions and content generation.

Method: Introduces HGC: (1) coarse-grained cache bypasses redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks; (2) fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within modules.

Result: On COCO-Stuff, HGC reduces MACs by 63% (18.22T to 6.70T) with less than 1.5% performance degradation.

Conclusion: HGC effectively balances generation efficiency and visual quality in controllable generative models.

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

*Wei Wang,Feng Jiang,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MPCGNet, a polyp segmentation method using coupling gates to address challenges like small polyp detection, ambiguous boundaries, and image noise. It includes three modules (CGMFE, WCAD, DFA) for noise filtering and feature selection, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve polyp segmentation by tackling issues like missed small polyps, unclear boundaries, and noise in colonoscopy images.

Method: Introduces coupling gates in three modules: CGMFE for noise suppression and local feature extraction, WCAD for precise polyp localization and detail restoration, and DFA for feature aggregation and importance selection.

Result: MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best performer on ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses key challenges in polyp segmentation, demonstrating competitive performance and accuracy.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: CrossMed is a benchmark evaluating compositional generalization in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured MAT schema, showing their potential and limitations in zero-shot and cross-task scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to generalize across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task types in medical AI.

Method: CrossMed reformulates four datasets into a unified VQA format and evaluates open-source LLMs (LLaVA-Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B) under Related, Unrelated, and zero-overlap MAT splits.

Result: Models perform well on Related splits (83.2% accuracy, 0.75 cIoU) but struggle with Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions. Segmentation improves with cross-task transfer.

Conclusion: CrossMed highlights the challenges and potential of multimodal LLMs in medical AI, providing a rigorous testbed for evaluating compositional generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

*Jiaming Huang,Yi Gao,Fuchang Pan,Renjie Li,Wei Dong*

TL;DR: SemanticNN is a semantic codec for device-edge collaboration in IoT, tolerating bit-level errors for semantic correctness under resource constraints, reducing feature transmission volume significantly while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for error-resilient systems arises from resource limitations and unreliable networks in IoT devices, where traditional bit-level transmission approaches are inefficient.

Method: SemanticNN uses a BER-aware decoder, Soft Quantization-based encoder, Feature-augmentation Learning, and XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance efficiency and semantic fidelity.

Result: Experiments show SemanticNN reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x under varying error rates while preserving inference accuracy.

Conclusion: SemanticNN offers a robust solution for efficient and resilient collaborative inference offloading in IoT environments.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

*Wenrui Li,Yidan Lu,Yeyu Chai,Rui Zhao,Hengyu Man,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces H$^{2}$ARN, a hyperbolic hierarchical alignment reasoning network for text-3D retrieval, addressing Hierarchy Representation Collapse and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-3D retrieval methods struggle with Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD), which degrade performance by compressing hierarchies or averaging noisy fragments.

Method: H$^{2}$ARN embeds text and 3D data in Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, using hierarchical ordering and instance-level contrastive losses. It also includes a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module to tackle RISD.

Result: The method preserves hierarchical distances and enhances discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy. A new benchmark, T3DR-HIT v2, with 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, is released.

Conclusion: H$^{2}$ARN effectively addresses HRC and RISD, improving text-3D retrieval performance, supported by an expanded benchmark and open-source code.

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PINGS-X, a novel framework leveraging axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations for high-resolution 4D flow MRI, addressing the slow training issue of physics-informed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between acquisition speed and accuracy in 4D flow MRI, particularly the slow training of existing methods like PINNs.

Method: PINGS-X uses axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations, normalized Gaussian splatting, and Gaussian merging to simplify training and improve efficiency.

Result: PINGS-X significantly reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy on CFD and real 4D flow MRI datasets.

Conclusion: PINGS-X offers a scalable and efficient solution for high-resolution 4D flow MRI, bridging the gap between speed and accuracy.

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

*Chuheng Chen,Xiaofei Zhou,Geyuan Zhang,Yong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NP-LoRA is a projection-based framework that improves LoRA fusion by preventing interference between principal directions, enhancing controllable generation without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods suffer from structural interference due to non-orthogonal representations, degrading fidelity in controllable generation.

Method: NP-LoRA uses SVD to extract principal directions and projects subject LoRA into its null space, introducing soft projection for fidelity-style trade-offs.

Result: Experiments show NP-LoRA outperforms baselines in fusion quality across metrics and backbones without retraining.

Conclusion: NP-LoRA effectively prevents interference during LoRA fusion, improving generative quality and flexibility.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment in image composition.

Method: The authors extend a generative composition model to multi-reference, allowing arbitrary foreground reference images, and propose calibrating global and local features for compatibility with backgrounds.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom show significant benefits from calibrated reference features.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances generative image composition by leveraging calibrated multi-reference features.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

TL;DR: LiteAttention leverages temporal coherence in diffusion attention patterns to skip redundant computations, combining dynamic adaptability with static efficiency, achieving speedups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for accelerating diffusion transformers face trade-offs between computational overhead and suboptimal static patterns, prompting a need for a better solution.

Method: Introduced LiteAttention, which exploits temporal coherence to skip non-essential attention computations across denoising steps, avoiding repeated profiling overheads.

Result: Substantial speedups were achieved on video diffusion models without degrading quality, thanks to optimized LiteAttention kernels.

Conclusion: LiteAttention effectively addresses the quadratic complexity issue in diffusion transformers, offering a practical solution for efficient video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

*Jiechao Gao,Chang Liu,Yuangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes S2D-Align, a novel SFT paradigm for Radiology Report Generation (RRG) that improves anatomically-grounded alignment using auxiliary signals of varying granularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for RRG using MLLMs focus on cross-modal alignment but fail to establish anatomically-grounded alignment due to the templated nature of reports, leading to sub-optimal generation quality.

Method: S2D-Align employs a shallow-to-deep strategy: starts with coarse radiograph-report pairing, adds instance-level guidance via reference reports, and grounds generation with key phrases for anatomical details. A memory-based adapter integrates coarse and fine-grained guidance.

Result: Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray benchmarks show S2D-Align achieves state-of-the-art performance, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: The multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach of S2D-Align enhances grounding capabilities in complex multimodal generation tasks.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Motivation: To determine the best generative models for 3D shape modeling and completion, especially under conditional information like noisy depth images.

Method: Adapted Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers for shape tasks, evaluated quantitatively with ablations.

Result: Diffusion models outperform discriminative and autoregressive approaches in noisy depth completion; autoregressive models match diffusion in discrete latent spaces.

Conclusion: Diffusion models are superior for certain 3D tasks, but autoregressive models can compete under specific conditions.

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in estimating liquid properties due to optical complexities and dynamic deformations, especially for autonomous robots.

Method: Creating Phys-Liquid with 97,200 simulation images and 3D meshes, validated via a four-stage reconstruction pipeline.

Result: Improved accuracy in liquid geometry and volume reconstruction, surpassing existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Phys-Liquid facilitates advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks, with dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

*Levi Harris,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaTformer, a video transformer using full space-time attention, excels in extreme precipitation forecasting from satellite radiances, addressing limitations of traditional NWP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NWP models are computationally intensive and perform poorly at nowcasting timescales (0-4 hours), prompting exploration of AI-driven alternatives like SaTformer.

Method: SaTformer uses video-understanding architectures with full space-time attention, reformulates precipitation regression as classification, and employs class-weighted loss for imbalance.

Result: Achieved first place in the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge.

Conclusion: SaTformer demonstrates superior performance in extreme precipitation forecasting and addresses dataset imbalances effectively.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRRs serve as a scalable, label-rich alternative for CAC detection, outperforming traditional methods when paired with lightweight CNNs and enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT-based Agatston scoring is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while CXRs lack reliable labels, prompting the use of DRRs as a surrogate for deep learning development.

Method: Generated synthetic DRRs from 667 CT scans, evaluated model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies.

Result: Best configuration achieved AUC of 0.754, outperforming prior CXR-based studies.

Conclusion: DRRs provide a scalable foundation for CAC detection, enabling future transfer learning to real CXRs.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

TL;DR: VideoP2R is a novel two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for video language models, enhancing reasoning by separating perception and reasoning processes, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement fine-tuning frameworks struggle with large video language models due to the complexity of video reasoning. VideoP2R aims to address this by modeling perception and reasoning distinctly.

Method: VideoP2R combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). In SFT, a three-step pipeline creates a process-aware chain-of-thought dataset (VideoP2R-CoT-162K). In RL, a novel PA-GRPO algorithm provides separate rewards for perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: VideoP2R successfully enhances video reasoning by treating perception and reasoning as distinct processes, validated by benchmark performance and ablation studies.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

*Redwan Hussain,Mizanur Rahman,Prithwiraj Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reviews AI-generated media detection methods, highlighting limitations like poor generalization and suggests future research focus on multimodal deep learning for robust solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI-generated media, like GANs and diffusion models, has led to misuse (e.g., deepfakes), necessitating better detection methods.

Method: The study reviews 24 recent works on AI-generated media detection, analyzing their contributions and weaknesses.

Result: Current detection models struggle with generalization, multimodal data, and modified content.

Conclusion: Future research should prioritize multimodal deep learning models to improve detection robustness against synthetic media threats.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

TL;DR: LVGM is a novel model generating vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting strokes, trained via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM, and validated with expert feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vectorized glyphs are versatile in design and animation. Leveraging LLMs' token sequence prediction abilities can enable dynamic glyph generation.

Method: Strokes are encoded as discrete latent variables (stroke embeddings). LVGM, fine-tuned from DeepSeek LLM, predicts the next stroke embedding to generate glyphs.

Result: LVGM generates complete characters, elegant words, and unseen verses in vectorized form. A new SVG dataset (907,267 samples) supports scalable glyph generation.

Conclusion: LVGM effectively scales glyph generation, validated by experts, and demonstrates the potential of LLMs in vectorized typography.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

*Yu Zhao,Ying Zhang,Xuhui Sui,Baohang Zhou,Li Shen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HinD with KEPO to enhance KBVQA by leveraging internal knowledge reasoning in MLLMs, outperforming existing methods without external APIs or knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KBVQA methods lack explicit multi-step reasoning trajectories from MLLMs, limiting their transparency and effectiveness.

Method: HinD uses hindsight wisdom to generate training data (Hindsight-Zero), distilled into CoT and Knowledge Generators. KEPO optimizes knowledge alignment.

Result: HinD achieves superior performance on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets with a 7B-size MLLM, without external resources.

Conclusion: HinD effectively elicits and utilizes internal knowledge reasoning in MLLMs, improving KBVQA performance and transparency.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

*Zhanpeng Wang,Shuting Cao,Yuhang Lu,Yuhan Li,Na Lei,Zhongxuan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-ALD, a new I2I translation framework, addresses inefficiency and latent distribution mismatches in DDIB by using optimal transport theory, improving speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIB faces low translation efficiency and trajectory deviations due to mismatched latent distributions.

Method: OT-ALD computes an OT map between source and target latent distributions, using mapped distribution for reverse diffusion.

Result: OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces FID score by 2.6 on average.

Conclusion: OT-ALD effectively balances faster translation with better quality, outperforming baseline models.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reverberation (Rev), a trajectory prediction model inspired by acoustics, to address latency preferences in agents' responses to trajectory-changing events, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction models struggle with learning and predicting agent-specific latencies, which can disrupt causal continuity and lead to unrealistic predictions.

Method: Proposes a reverberation transform and the Rev model, using learnable reverberation kernels to simulate and predict latency preferences and stochasticity in agents' responses.

Result: Rev achieves competitive accuracy on multiple datasets (pedestrians and vehicles) and provides interpretable latency dynamics. Qualitative analyses confirm the transform's potential.

Conclusion: The Rev model effectively addresses latency-related challenges in trajectory prediction, offering improved accuracy and interpretability, with broader applicability suggested.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD is a lightweight convolutional framework for explainable multi-type anomaly detection, eliminating the need for separate models per object category and reducing computational load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods lack specificity in differentiating anomaly types and are computationally intensive, limiting practicality in real-time systems.

Method: MultiTypeFCDD uses image-level labels to train multi-channel heatmaps, each corresponding to a specific anomaly type, within a unified framework.

Result: Evaluated on Real-IAD, MultiTypeFCDD competes with state-of-the-art models while reducing parametric load and inference times.

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD is a practical and efficient solution for multi-type anomaly detection in resource-constrained real-world applications.

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Method: Data was collected using two synchronized vehicles across diverse weather and lighting conditions, annotated with 3D bounding boxes and static scenes for 4D BEV representation.

Result: The dataset includes 60K LiDAR frames, 1.26M camera images, and 750K GNSS/IMU records, supporting precise temporal alignment.

Conclusion: CATS-V2V aims to advance autonomous driving research by providing a high-quality, large-scale dataset for complex scenarios.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignVQA introduces a debate-based multi-agent framework to improve confidence calibration in VQA systems, using specialized VLMs and a novel calibration-aware loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern VQA systems often produce overconfident responses, lacking reliable confidence estimates, which is critical for high-stakes applications like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation.

Method: AlignVQA employs a multi-agent debate framework where specialized VLMs generate answers and undergo critique, refinement, and aggregation in two-stage interactions. A novel calibration-aware loss function (aligncal) fine-tunes agents to minimize calibration error.

Result: Empirical results show significant reductions in calibration errors, with more calibrated specialized agents producing better-aligned confidence estimates.

Conclusion: The AlignVQA framework effectively improves confidence calibration in VQA systems, enhancing reliability in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel temporal alignment strategy improves 4D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction for unsynchronized multi-view videos by estimating and compensating for camera time shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view video setups often suffer from temporal misalignment due to camera delays or independent recordings, reducing reconstruction quality.

Method: A coarse-to-fine alignment module estimates frame-level offsets and refines them to sub-frame accuracy.

Result: The method effectively handles temporally misaligned videos and enhances baseline reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, improving robustness for asynchronous multi-view video data.

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

TL;DR: Viper-F1 is an efficient hybrid state-space vision-language model that replaces attention with liquid state-space dynamics and uses a token-grid correlation module for fine-grained visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of Transformer-based MLLMs and their inefficiency in capturing fine-grained visual regions.

Method: Introduces Viper-F1, which uses liquid state-space dynamics instead of attention and a token-grid correlation module for visual grounding.

Result: Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with linear-time inference.

Conclusion: The model offers improved efficiency and performance for vision-language tasks in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve short-range pollution forecasting accuracy for PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across India by leveraging specialized deep learning models and CAMS analysis fields.

Method: Uses CAMS Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution, trains models on 2021-2023 data with a 90/10 split, and evaluates on 2024 data. Three lightweight architectures are designed for accuracy and rapid inference.

Conclusion: Compact and specialized deep learning models are highly effective for short-range pollution nowcasting in limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

TL;DR: Transfer-learning framework using ConvGRU for short-term rainfall prediction achieves 2nd place in Weather4Cast 2025 competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve short-term rainfall prediction accuracy using SEVIRI infrared channel data and a transfer-learning approach.

Method: Two-stage training: ConvGRU forecasts brightness temperatures, then maps to rainfall rates. Event detection extracts spatiotemporal features.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in cumulative rainfall task; similar performance to baseline in event prediction.

Conclusion: ConvGRU-based transfer-learning framework effectively predicts rainfall and identifies precipitation events.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing geospatial reasoning in VQA for satellite imagery to support high-stakes climate applications like disaster monitoring and urban planning.

Method: Integration of CoT reasoning with DPO to generate intermediate rationales, improving interpretability and accuracy in tasks like detection and spatial analysis.

Result: CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9% over baselines, with DPO further enhancing accuracy and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: The framework advances VQA for Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

*Amir Rosenfeld,Neta Glazer,Ethan Fetaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are highly sensitive to small, benign visual and textual perturbations, affecting their reliability. Stability correlates with correctness, and small models can predict larger models' errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness of VLMs under minor input changes that preserve meaning, addressing gaps in reliability evaluations.

Method: Large-scale study testing VLMs against pixel shifts, geometric transformations, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites. Analyzed stability across models and datasets.

Result: Modern VLMs are unstable under minor perturbations, with stability indicating correctness. Small models' stability patterns predict larger models' errors.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit fundamental fragility; robustness evaluations should focus on invariances beyond adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning systems in safety-sensitive 3D domains like autonomous driving and robotics, motivating the need for advanced attack frameworks.

Method: The method leverages spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space to design a configurable spherical trigger, allowing a single trigger to encode multiple target classes.

Result: Experimental results show high attack success rates (up to 100%) across datasets and model architectures, while maintaining clean data accuracy.

Conclusion: This work sets a benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides foundational insights for securing future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAFM^3 is a framework that uses lightweight modular components to adapt a single foundation model for diverse medical imaging tasks and modalities, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of data scarcity in medical imaging by enabling a single foundation model to handle multiple domains, tasks, and modalities.

Method: Introduces MAFM^3, which uses modular components to specialize a foundation model for different tasks (e.g., prognosis, segmentation) and modalities (e.g., CT, PET) without building separate models.

Result: Improved performance on prognosis and segmentation tasks; achieved a 5% higher Dice score when incorporating PET scans compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Foundation models with modular components can evolve into versatile multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging, overcoming initial training scope limitations.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

*Ruocheng Wu,Haolan He,Yufei Wang,Zhihao Li,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guidance Score Distillation (GSD), a framework leveraging Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by addressing overfitting in sparse-view training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with overfitting when trained on sparse views due to lack of supervision. The authors aim to exploit VDM's multi-view consistency priors to improve robustness.

Method: GSD utilizes Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to supervise rendered images from neighboring views. It introduces depth warp and semantic feature guidance to align VDM's generative direction with correct camera poses and geometry.

Result: Experiments demonstrate GSD's superiority over existing methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: GSD effectively mitigates overfitting in 3DGS by leveraging VDMs and novel guidance mechanisms, enhancing multi-view consistency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores positional bias in multimodal representation models, revealing its prevalence and varying manifestations in text and image encoders during image-text retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias negatively impacts model performance, yet its effects in multimodal models are underexplored, prompting this investigation.

Method: The study distinguishes context importance from positional bias and analyzes its presence across models and datasets in image-text retrieval.

Result: Text encoders favor input beginnings, while image encoders show bias at both ends, influenced by encoding schemes, training loss, and multimodal data usage.

Conclusion: Positional bias is widespread in multimodal models, shaped by multiple factors, highlighting the need for further research and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity gaze redirection is needed for generating augmented data to improve gaze estimator generalization.

Method: DiT-Gaze combines Diffusion Transformer, weak supervision with synthetic gaze angles, and orthogonality constraint loss.

Result: DiT-Gaze reduces gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze provides a superior method for synthetic training data and will be made publicly available.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DoReMi, a Mixture-of-Experts framework, to address multi-domain 3D point cloud learning by combining domain-aware and domain-general features for improved performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-domain 3D point cloud learning due to dataset limitations and heterogeneity, leading to negative transfer. The synergy between domain-aware and domain-general features is often overlooked.

Method: DoReMi uses Domain-Guided Spatial Routing and Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation to dynamically activate domain-aware experts while maintaining global consistency with a frozen unified representation branch.

Result: DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: DoReMi demonstrates strong performance and potential as a foundation framework for multi-domain 3D understanding.

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General image editing models struggle with new styles due to limited paired data, necessitating an efficient fine-tuning solution.

Method: Proposes MoE LoRA with style-specific/shared routing, metric-guided rank optimization, and integrates adversarial learning and flow matching in Diffusion in Transformer (DiT).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer LoRA parameters.

Conclusion: The framework effectively adapts image editing models to new styles using minimal data and computational resources.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

TL;DR: GEODE tackles 3D spatial intelligence gaps in VLMs by introducing specialized modules for decoupled 3D reasoning and precise numerical output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with real-world 3D understanding due to input-stage conflicts and output-stage misalignment.

Method: Introduces GEODE with Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) for spatial reasoning and Direct Regression Head (DRH) for precise numerical outputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance with a 1.5B parameter model, rivaling larger 7B+ models.

Conclusion: GEODE effectively resolves bottlenecks in VLMs for 3D spatial intelligence, offering scalable and efficient performance.

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of joint attention in ASD by automating gaze detection, aiding children with limited access to professionals.

Method: Introduces SACF, a two-pathway architecture with expert models for social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate, using the AGT dataset.

Result: SACF achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in detecting face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: The SACF framework effectively addresses class imbalance in ASD datasets, showing promise for automated joint attention measurement.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

TL;DR: CountSteer improves text-to-image models' ability to follow numerical instructions by steering cross-attention during inference, enhancing object-count accuracy by ~4% without losing visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with numerical instructions despite latent awareness of counting accuracy, suggesting potential for improvement.

Method: Introduces CountSteer, a training-free method that adjusts cross-attention hidden states during inference to better meet specified counts.

Result: CountSteer boosts object-count accuracy by approximately 4% while maintaining image quality.

Conclusion: CountSteer offers a simple, effective way to enhance numerical instruction adherence in text-to-image models, advancing controllable generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-language model that groups caption tokens to capture fine-grained language representations aligned with image objects, improving understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained knowledge is essential for vision-language models, but current methods focus on aligning image patches with tokens, which lack meaningful grounding.

Method: The model groups caption tokens to form fine-grained representations aligned with an image encoder's object discoveries.

Result: The model achieves better fine-grained understanding, and the discovered token groups closely match groundable text phrases.

Conclusion: Token grouping enhances vision-language models' fine-grained comprehension and grounding accuracy.

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Fabian Schmidt,Markus Enzweiler,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance vision-language models for autonomous driving by conditioning them on structured relational context using traffic scene graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models lack explicit supervision for relational dependencies in traffic scenes, limiting their ability to infer dynamic interactions from raw sensor data.

Method: The authors introduce a model-agnostic approach that serializes traffic scene graphs at various abstraction levels and incorporates them into models via structured prompt templates.

Result: Evaluations show significant improvements, with driving scores increasing by up to 15.6% for LMDrive and 17.5% for BEVDriver.

Conclusion: Scene graph-conditioned training helps models internalize relational priors, improving performance without requiring scene graphs at test-time.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

*Massimo Rizzoli,Simone Alghisi,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a redesigned fine-tuning process for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using controlled synthetic data generation to address biases and imbalances, showing improved performance on real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome biases, errors, and distribution imbalances in fine-tuning VLMs with real-world data, the authors aim to create a more controlled and balanced synthetic dataset.

Method: The method involves generating synthetic data with controlled attributes (color, shape, size, position) and annotations, followed by fine-tuning VLMs and evaluating transferability to real-world data.

Result: Fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data leads to uniform performance across scenes and better real-world task performance (e.g., on COCO) compared to traditional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Controlled synthetic data generation effectively mitigates biases and improves VLM performance, demonstrating its potential for robust fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $Φ$eat, a self-supervised visual backbone that disentangles high-level semantics from low-level physical factors like geometry and illumination, focusing on material identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised features mix high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, limiting their use in tasks needing explicit physical reasoning.

Method: The method employs a pretraining strategy contrasting spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions.

Result: $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping, showing promise for unsupervised physical feature learning.

Conclusion: Unsupervised physical feature learning holds potential as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

*Haoyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORAL introduces a coordinative learning framework for volumetric medical image segmentation, leveraging continuous anatomical similarity and global directional consistency to improve performance under limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods discard valuable continuous anatomical information and overlook global directional consistency, leading to distorted feature spaces.

Method: CORAL uses a contrastive ranking objective for local anatomical similarity and an ordinal objective for global directional consistency, aligning features with canonical anatomical progression.

Result: CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets in limited-annotation settings while learning anatomically meaningful representations.

Conclusion: CORAL effectively captures both local and global anatomical structure, enhancing volumetric segmentation performance.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

### [80] [D-GAP: Improving Out-of-Domain Robustness via Dataset-Agnostic and Gradient-Guided Augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11286)
*Ruoqi Wang,Haitao Wang,Shaojie Guo,Qiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-GAP improves OOD robustness by combining frequency and pixel-space augmentations guided by gradients, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of OOD robustness in computer vision, where traditional augmentations fail or require expert input, and neural networks struggle with domain-specific biases.

Method: D-GAP uses gradient-guided sensitivity maps in frequency space to adaptively interpolate amplitudes and blends pixel-space details for targeted augmentation.

Result: D-GAP achieves +5.3% better OOD performance on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmarks compared to other augmentations.

Conclusion: D-GAP offers a dataset-agnostic solution for improving OOD robustness by addressing frequency and pixel-level biases effectively.

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Result: Achieves real-time performance (~0.06 sec/image), 800x faster than prior 3D-aware methods, with superior redirection accuracy and image quality.

Conclusion: RTGaze sets a new standard for efficient, high-quality gaze redirection, enabling practical applications.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimuFreeMark introduces a noise-simulation-free watermarking framework leveraging low-frequency components' robustness, outperforming current methods without needing noise simulation during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AIGC demands robust watermarking resilient to signal processing and semantic attacks; current methods' reliance on noise simulation limits generalization.

Method: SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks into low-frequency components' deep feature space using a pre-trained VAE, avoiding noise simulation layers.

Result: The framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods in resisting conventional and semantic attacks while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark offers a novel, effective approach to robust watermarking by exploiting low-frequency stability, eliminating noise simulation needs.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AUVIC, a novel framework for visual concept unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing privacy concerns by precisely removing target concepts without affecting related entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data privacy concerns and regulatory requirements necessitate efficient unlearning techniques for MLLMs, particularly for visual concepts, which remain underexplored.

Method: AUVIC uses adversarial perturbations to isolate and remove target visual concepts while minimizing impact on related entities.

Result: AUVIC achieves high target forgetting rates with minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Conclusion: AUVIC is an effective solution for visual concept unlearning in MLLMs, validated by the VCUBench benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

*Saptarshi Neil Sinha,Julius Kühn,Mika Silvan Goschke,Michael Weinmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for 6D pose estimation of strawberries using synthetic data generated via a Blender pipeline, achieving comparable accuracy on high-end and edge devices, with potential for broader fruit applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing labor shortages and high costs in agriculture by improving automated fruit harvesting through advanced pose estimation techniques.

Method: Uses YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm and synthetic data from a procedural Blender pipeline to enhance realism for training pose estimation models.

Result: Models perform well on NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano, with accurate pose inference for ripe strawberries but challenges with unripe ones.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for strawberries and adaptable to other fruits, with potential improvements for unripe detection.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the impracticality of deploying large models on resource-constrained edge devices due to high memory consumption.

Method: Introduces a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor and Streaming Abstention mechanism to encode and process documents efficiently.

Result: DocSLM matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly fewer visual tokens, parameters, and lower latency.

Conclusion: DocSLM enables reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices efficiently.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

TL;DR: YCB-Ev SD is a synthetic dataset for 6DoF object pose estimation using event-camera data, addressing gaps in event-based vision resources. It provides 50k event sequences with optimized event representations for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic datasets for frame-based computer vision lack equivalents in event-based vision, hindering progress in 6DoF object pose estimation.

Method: The dataset is synthesized from PBR scenes of YCB-Video objects using simulated linear camera motion. It evaluates event representations like time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding.

Result: Linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding outperform other methods, with polarity information being crucial for performance gains.

Conclusion: YCB-Ev SD fills a critical gap in event-based vision resources, offering high-quality data and optimized representations for reproducible benchmarking.

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

*Sheng Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Sidan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D is a novel framework that generates realistic 3D motions without 3D annotations, using 2D motion data and advanced regularization to achieve robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D motion generation models rely heavily on precise 3D supervision, limiting their generalization. Free3D aims to remove this dependency by learning from 2D data.

Method: Free3D employs a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) to map 2D sequences to 3D-consistent latent spaces and uses regularization objectives for view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility.

Result: Free3D generates diverse, coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions outperforming 3D-supervised models.

Conclusion: Relaxing explicit 3D supervision enhances structural reasoning and generalization, providing a scalable and data-efficient approach for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HMRF-UNet, combining unsupervised HMRF theory with CNN segmentation to achieve high accuracy without ground truth, reducing the need for labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation methods lack accuracy or speed, and supervised CNNs require large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches suffer from slow performance and lower accuracy.

Method: Integrates Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) theory with CNN segmentation (HMRF-UNet), exploring neighborhood terms and components for unsupervised loss.

Result: Achieves high segmentation accuracy on μCT images of PU foam without ground truth and proposes a pre-training strategy to minimize labeled data needs.

Conclusion: The HMRF-UNet effectively combines unsupervised and supervised learning benefits, offering fast and accurate segmentation with reduced reliance on labeled data.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

TL;DR: The paper proposes LSEF, a hierarchical framework for stable and discriminative emotion understanding in videos by disentangling emotional bases and transient fluctuations using low-rank sparse modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VAC models struggle with instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics, lacking mechanisms to hierarchically disentangle emotional components.

Method: LSEF uses SEM for low-rank emotional bases, DDM for sparse transient signals, and CIM for multi-scale coherence, optimized by RAO for gradient balance.

Result: Experiments show LSEF improves robustness and dynamic discrimination across datasets, validating hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling.

Conclusion: LSEF effectively addresses affective dynamics instability by hierarchically disentangling emotional components, proving its generality and effectiveness.

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data limits scientific reasoning for microscopy in Multimodal Large Language Models.

Method: Three-stage process: (1) bootstrap from expert-validated figure-caption pairs, (2) filter inconsistencies using HiCQA-Graph (fusing NLI, CLIP, agent signals), (3) generate MCQs via MLLM and human screening.

Result: Produces a quality-controlled dataset exceeding MicroVQA benchmark Bloom's level hard-sample distribution. Enables competitive microscopy reasoning performance for 4B-scale MLLMs.

Conclusion: MicroVQA++ and HiCQA-Graph provide a robust framework for high-quality microscopy VQA data, advancing multimodal reasoning in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Motivation: To explore underexplored DIQA potential in MLLMs and provide a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: Proposes Q-Doc, evaluating MLLMs at coarse (quality scores), middle (distortion-type identification), and fine (distortion-severity assessment) levels.

Result: MLLMs show nascent DIQA abilities but critical limitations; CoT prompting enhances performance.

Conclusion: The work benchmarks DIQA in MLLMs, highlighting deficiencies and pathways for improvement.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

### [92] [BOFA: Bridge-Layer Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11421)
*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA is a novel framework for Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) using CLIP, addressing adaptation and forgetting issues without extra parameters or inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) struggles with forgetting and inefficient modality integration in vision-language models like CLIP.

Method: BOFA adapts CLIP's cross-modal bridge-layer using Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion and employs cross-modal hybrid prototypes.

Result: BOFA outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: BOFA effectively integrates visual and textual modalities for CIL, achieving stable knowledge accumulation without data replay.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

### [93] [Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422)
*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive teaching paradigm to address challenges in cross-modal alignment between visual and EEG modalities, achieving superior zero-shot retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The asymmetry between visual and EEG modalities creates fidelity and semantic gaps, which prior methods overlook, leading to poor generalization.

Method: The paper introduces the adaptive teaching paradigm, implemented via ShrinkAdapter, a module designed to dynamically adjust the teacher modality (vision) to match the student (EEG).

Result: The method achieves 60.2% top-1 accuracy in zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by 9.8%.

Conclusion: The adaptive teaching paradigm effectively bridges the asymmetric vision-brain gap by tailoring the teacher modality to the student's capacity.

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

*Francisco Nogueira,Alexandre Bernardino,Bruno Martins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multilingual REC model and dataset, spanning 10 languages, using attention-anchored neural architecture for competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the English-centric nature of REC research and meet global deployment demands by expanding to multilingual contexts.

Method: Constructed a multilingual dataset via machine translation and introduced an attention-anchored neural architecture with multilingual SigLIP2 encoders.

Result: Achieved 86.9% accuracy on multilingual RefCOCO evaluation (vs. 91.3% English-only), showing consistent multilingual performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems with practical applications.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

*Wei Chow,Jiachun Pan,Yongyuan Liang,Mingze Zhou,Xue Song,Liyu Jia,Saining Zhang,Siliang Tang,Juncheng Li,Fengda Zhang,Weijia Wu,Hanwang Zhang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEAVE introduces a suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation, addressing gaps in existing datasets focused on multi-turn interactions. It includes WEAVE-100k, a large-scale dataset, and WEAVEBench, a human-annotated benchmark, showcasing advancements and challenges in multi-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets miss the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image tasks. WEAVE bridges this gap by enabling interleaved comprehension and generation.

Method: WEAVE consists of WEAVE-100k (100K interleaved samples) and WEAVEBench (100 tasks). It uses a hybrid VLM judger for evaluation, assessing multi-turn generation, visual memory, and reasoning.

Result: Training on WEAVE-100k enhances vision comprehension, editing, and collaboration capabilities. WEAVEBench reveals current model limitations in context-aware tasks.

Conclusion: WEAVE advances multimodal research by providing tools for studying in-context interleaved tasks, highlighting progress and ongoing challenges.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

### [96] [The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11435)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how text-to-image diffusion models balance memorization and generalization, focusing on multimodal iconicity—culturally shared associations between texts and images. It introduces an evaluation framework distinguishing recognition from realization, tested on five models with Wikidata-derived references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify how diffusion models handle cultural references, balancing recognition and reproduction, and advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching.

Method: The authors introduce a framework separating recognition (identifying references) from realization (depicting them). They evaluate five models using 767 Wikidata-derived references and prompt perturbation experiments.

Result: The framework effectively distinguishes replication from transformation. Models often reproduce iconic visuals even with altered textual cues, and cultural alignment correlates with data frequency, uniqueness, popularity, and creation date.

Conclusion: Diffusion models' value lies in transforming and recontextualizing cultural knowledge, highlighting the need for richer evaluation methods beyond basic text-image matching.

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

### [97] [Hi-DREAM: Brain Inspired Hierarchical Diffusion for fMRI Reconstruction via ROI Encoder and visuAl Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11437)
*Guowei Zhang,Yun Zhao,Moein Khajehnejad,Adeel Razi,Levin Kuhlmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM proposes a brain-inspired diffusion framework (Hi-DREAM) that leverages cortical hierarchy for fMRI-to-image decoding, outperforming current methods by explicitly modeling visual information organization across the brain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI decoders overlook hierarchical processing in the brain, blurring the roles of different visual areas. Hi-DREAM addresses this by aligning decoding with cortical organization.

Method: Hi-DREAM uses a region-of-interest adapter to group fMRI data into early/mid/late streams, forming a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with U-Net depth. A ControlNet injects these hints during denoising.

Result: Hi-DREAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining low-level fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of cortical hierarchy-based conditioning.

Conclusion: Structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to data-driven embeddings and offers insights into the functional contributions of visual areas.

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

TL;DR: VP-Bench is introduced to evaluate MLLMs' ability to interpret visual prompts (VPs) like bounding boxes, assessing perception and utilization across 28 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' VP interpretation, hindering understanding of their effectiveness in vision-language tasks.

Method: VP-Bench uses a two-stage framework: Stage 1 tests VP perception with 30k prompts across shapes/attributes; Stage 2 evaluates VP impact on downstream tasks.

Result: 28 MLLMs are assessed, revealing factors influencing VP understanding (e.g., VP attributes, question arrangement, model scale).

Conclusion: VP-Bench provides a standard framework for studying MLLMs' VP comprehension, advancing vision-language applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical chess lacks assistance tools compared to digital platforms, creating a divide. CVChess bridges this gap by providing real-time move suggestions for physical games.

Method: Uses a CNN with residual layers for piece recognition. Steps include image preprocessing (Hough Line Transform, projective transform), segmentation into 64 squares, and piece classification into 13 classes.

Result: Trained on ChessReD (10,800 annotated images), the system accurately converts chessboard images to FEN for chess engine input.

Conclusion: CVChess successfully bridges the analog-digital chess gap by providing reliable move assistance for physical games using deep learning.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MaMOL, a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras framework, to address multimodal classification challenges caused by missing modalities. It uses dual-routing mechanisms for efficient adaptation and achieves robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with missing modalities due to computational costs and unrealistic assumptions of complete data during training.

Method: MaMOL employs a dual-routing mechanism: a dynamic router for missing patterns and a static router for cross-modal knowledge sharing, enabling lightweight updates.

Result: MaMOL shows superior robustness and generalization on remote sensing benchmarks with minimal overhead and validates scalability on natural image datasets.

Conclusion: MaMOL is a general, efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning, offering parameter-efficient adaptation and cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address randomness and inconsistency in text-to-image models when prompts are vague, and to unify existing approaches without additional modules or computational overhead.

Method: Introduces ImAgent, a training-free framework with a policy controller enabling dynamic interaction and self-organization of generation actions.

Result: Outperforms backbone models and strong baselines in image generation and editing tasks.

Conclusion: ImAgent demonstrates the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Result: Achieved mean Dice Score of 0.805 and mean IoU of 0.709 on lung squamous cell carcinoma data, with uncertainty maps correlating strongly with segmentation error.

Conclusion: nnUNet-B demonstrates promise for scalable and interpretable PD-L1 assessment, though uncertainty calibration needs improvement.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight method to detect object hallucinations in LVLMs by analyzing attention weights over prelim tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) often hallucinate objects due to weak image dependence, relying more on prelim tokens. This unreliability needs addressing.

Method: The authors quantify image dependence via mutual information and propose PAS, a training-free signal derived from attention weights over prelim tokens, computed during inference.

Result: PAS significantly improves hallucination detection across models and datasets, allowing real-time intervention without additional computational cost.

Conclusion: PAS leverages overlooked attention signals to enhance LVLM reliability, offering a practical solution for hallucination detection.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

TL;DR: OpenUS is an open-source ultrasound foundation model using a vision Mamba backbone and a novel self-adaptive masking framework to address challenges in ultrasound AI generalizability and label efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound image interpretation is operator-dependent and varies across factors like anatomical regions and devices, hindering generalizable AI models.

Method: OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone and a self-adaptive masking framework combining contrastive learning with masked image modeling, using a dynamic learning schedule.

Result: The model is pre-trained on the largest public ultrasound dataset (308K images from 42 datasets) and can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: OpenUS offers a reproducible, label-efficient solution for ultrasound AI challenges, leveraging large-scale public data and adaptive pre-training strategies.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

### [106] [Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526)
*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE proposes a lightweight fusion module using cross-only, bidirectional attention layers to align vision and text encoder hidden states, improving performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs fuse modalities early or late, often tying fusion to autoregressive decoders, but hidden states already carry rich modality-specific structure. Direct alignment of these states is a natural solution.

Method: A few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers near the top of encoders project vision and text hidden states into a shared space, attend across modalities, and send gated residual updates back with stabilizers.

Result: BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs on retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks while preserving bi-encoder efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed fusion module effectively aligns modality-specific hidden states without compromising encoder strength or decoupling generation, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

### [107] [Unsupervised Cycle Detection in Agentic Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10650)
*Felix George,Harshit Kumar,Divya Pathak,Kaustabha Ray,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unsupervised framework detects hidden cycles in LLM agentic applications, combining structural and semantic analysis for better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional observability fails to identify resource-consuming cycles in LLM applications.

Method: Hybrid approach using temporal call stack and semantic similarity analysis.

Result: Achieves F1 score of 0.72, outperforming individual methods (structural F1: 0.08, semantic F1: 0.28).

Conclusion: Encouraging results but needs refinement for broader applicability.

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

### [108] [Data Analysis and Performance Evaluation of Simulation Deduction Based on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10651)
*Shansi Zhang,Min Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using LLMs for structured data analysis in military simulations, improving report quality via multi-round interactions and custom tools, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual analysis is slow and error-prone; LLMs can enhance efficiency but require structured prompts for high-quality reports.

Method: Decomposes tasks into sub-tasks with tailored prompts, uses multi-round LLM interactions, self-check, reflection, and custom tools for metrics/graphics.

Result: Reports generated show higher quality and scores compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively leverages LLMs for structured, high-quality military simulation analysis, surpassing traditional approaches.

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

*Rafael Arias Gonzalez,Steve DiPaola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an architecture for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, balancing depth and speed through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for historical character dialogue systems either produce shallow responses or achieve depth at high latency, creating a need for a balanced solution.

Method: The system transforms biographical data into enriched first-person memories with metadata and uses efficient two-stage retrieval.

Result: The approach achieves fast prompt generation (0.52s) and outperforms traditional methods on smaller models while enabling novel visualization tools.

Conclusion: The architecture is generalizable and practical for educational, museum, and research applications, offering accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

### [110] [iMAD: Intelligent Multi-Agent Debate for Efficient and Accurate LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11306)
*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iMAD selectively triggers Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) for complex tasks, reducing token usage by 92% and improving accuracy by 13.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning and accuracy in LLM agents while avoiding computational inefficiency and potential accuracy degradation from indiscriminate MAD use.

Method: Proposes iMAD, which uses a single agent's self-critique response to extract features and a lightweight classifier to decide when to trigger MAD.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in token usage and improvements in accuracy across six question-answering datasets.

Conclusion: iMAD efficiently balances computational cost and accuracy by intelligently triggering MAD only when beneficial.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

*Desheng Kong,Xiangshuo Cui,Jiaying Jin,Jing Xu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HyQuT is the first hybrid quantum-classical LLM for natural language generation, integrating VQCs into Transformers, showing feasibility with minimal qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore quantum computing's potential in large-scale natural language generation, overcoming limitations of existing quantum models.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining variational quantum circuits with Transformer frameworks at 8M and 150M parameter scales.

Result: Minimal qubits (10 qubits, 80 gates) replace 10% of classical parameters in 150M model, maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of quantum integration in large-scale LLMs, with comparable stability and quality.

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

### [112] [Empirical Characterization of Temporal Constraint Processing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10654)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with temporal constraint processing in real-time decisions, showing bimodal performance, prompt brittleness, and action bias, unaffected by parameter count. Fine-tuning helps partially, but architectural changes are needed for reliable temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates the untested assumption that LLMs can reliably handle temporal constraints in real-time decision-making tasks, which is critical for deploying them in agentic architectures.

Method: Eight production-scale models (2.8B-8B parameters) were evaluated using deadline detection tasks. Performance metrics included accuracy distributions, prompt brittleness, and action bias. Fine-tuning with 200 synthetic examples was also tested.

Result: Models exhibited bimodal performance (95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness, and systematic action bias. Parameter count didn't correlate with capability. Fine-tuning improved partial-capability models by 12-37 points but couldn't fully resolve issues.

Conclusion: Temporal constraint satisfaction requires architectural mechanisms like continuous temporal state representation and explicit constraint checking, which autoregressive models lack. Hybrid architectures with symbolic reasoning are recommended for time-critical applications.

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

### [113] [Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning II: Semantic Node Merging, Entailment Filtering, and Knowledge Graph Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10655)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper enhances Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning with three semantically grounded improvements: transformer-based node merging, sentence-level entailment validation, and knowledge graph alignment, achieving better accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness, interpretability, and scalability of the Spectral NSR framework by refining graph quality upstream of the spectral reasoning stage.

Method: Introduces three enhancements: transformer-based node merging, sentence-level entailment validation, and alignment with external knowledge graphs.

Result: Shows accuracy gains (up to +3.8%), better generalization, and reduced noise on benchmarks like ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR.

Conclusion: The enhancements make the Spectral NSR framework more efficient and suitable for real-world applications without altering its core reasoning engine.

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

### [114] [Preference Orchestrator: Prompt-Aware Multi-Objective Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10656)
*Biao Liu,Ning Xu,Junming Yang,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRO, a framework to automate preference weighting in LLM alignment, improving efficiency and avoiding manual specification burdens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences for multiple objectives is challenging due to manual preference weight specifications and suboptimal training efficiency.

Method: PRO uses a lightweight preference adapter to infer prompt-specific preference weights during training and deployment, learning from normalized reward scores across objectives.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments show PRO outperforms fixed-weight methods in multi-objective alignment tasks.

Conclusion: PRO effectively automates preference weighting, enhancing alignment efficiency and performance in LLMs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

*You Zuo,Kim Gerdes,Eric Villemonte de La Clergerie,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A contrastive learning framework for patent embeddings uses section-based augmentation to address the issue of overly uniform embeddings, improving semantic cohesion and performance on retrieval and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the failure mode of SimCSE-style dropout augmentation in patent embeddings, which loses semantic cohesion, by leveraging multiple views within a patent document.

Method: The proposed method uses section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views to introduce natural semantic and structural diversity.

Result: The fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation- and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, avoiding reliance on brittle annotations. Different sections specialize for different tasks: claims aid retrieval, while background sections aid classification.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the value of intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding, highlighting the importance of patent-specific discourse structure.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

TL;DR: Open-weight LLMs can effectively extract structured data from multilingual clinical reports across various diseases, with small-to-medium general-purpose models performing as well as larger ones. Prompting strategies and task-specific factors significantly impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the capability of open-weight LLMs in extracting structured information from clinical reports across multiple languages and diseases, addressing limitations of prior work focused on single tasks or English-only reports.

Method: 15 open-weight LLMs were tested on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Six prompting strategies were compared, and performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, consensus rank aggregation, and linear mixed-effects models.

Result: Top models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement. Small-to-medium general-purpose models matched large models, while tiny and specialised models lagged. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors had more impact than model size or prompting.

Conclusion: Open-weight LLMs are scalable for clinical data curation across diseases, languages, and institutions, with performance influenced by task complexity and prompting strategies more than model size.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs excel at extracting structured data from complex fiscal documents by leveraging hierarchical validation checks, outperforming traditional OCR methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored capability of LLMs in processing hierarchical tabular data, particularly in converting lengthy fiscal documents into structured databases.

Method: The method involves a multi-stage pipeline using LLM-based techniques, domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation to extract and verify data from fiscal tables.

Result: The approach achieves high accuracy in extracting data from Karnataka's 200+ page fiscal documents, validated through hierarchical relationships and internal checks.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for scalable conversion of fiscal PDFs into research-ready databases, with potential applications in developing countries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.

*Qihang Zhang,Muchen Li,Ziao Wang,Renjie Liao,Lele Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework combining universal compression with neural language models via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE) to improve text compression without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compressors are fast but less effective, while neural compressors generalize poorly. The aim is to combine their strengths for better compression.

Method: Uses Test-Time Steering via wPoE to adaptively blend universal compression and pretrained neural language models at inference.

Result: Ensures compression rates at least as good as the best individual model, improving performance without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

*Rachel Longjohn,Shang Wu,Saatvik Kher,Catarina Belém,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty in binary evaluations of LLM outputs, addressing gaps in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs lack statistical uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for reliable assessments.

Method: The authors introduce a Bayesian statistical framework to measure uncertainty in binary metrics, focusing on probabilistic text generation strategies.

Result: Case studies show the Bayesian method effectively quantifies uncertainty in refusal rates and pairwise LLM preferences.

Conclusion: The Bayesian approach enhances evaluation reliability by providing meaningful uncertainty quantification for LLM behavior.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates seven LLMs on Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish tasks, revealing gaps in cultural nuance and morphological understanding despite strong performance by proprietary models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM effectiveness in low-resource, morphologically rich languages and culturally diverse tasks, addressing underexplored areas.

Method: Human evaluations (fluency, accuracy, cultural appropriateness) and automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) on four tasks: QA, summarization, translation, and dialogue.

Result: Proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) perform best, but struggle with cultural and linguistic nuances; open-source models lag significantly.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement in cultural awareness and linguistic generalization, emphasizing the need for further research and better benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Guard models for LLM safety are vulnerable to superficial linguistic changes. A self-supervised framework improves semantic robustness, reducing variability by ~58% and boosting accuracy by ~2.5%. It also enhances calibration, linking consistency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guard models lack semantic grounding, causing safety scores to fluctuate with paraphrases. Addressing this improves model reliability and safety.

Method: A self-supervised framework uses paraphrase sets and skew-aware aggregation to enforce prediction consistency.

Result: Reduces semantic variability by ~58%, improves accuracy by ~2.5%, and enhances calibration by up to 40%.

Conclusion: Treating semantic consistency as a training objective builds more reliable guard models, linking consistency and calibration.

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STaDS, a framework to evaluate LLMs' understanding by testing their ability to make consistent, well-founded decisions across diverse domains, revealing gaps between accuracy and genuine understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs achieve genuine understanding beyond predictive accuracy, akin to human expertise.

Method: Developed STaDS, simulating structured decision exams for LLMs across 15 settings, evaluating comprehension, prediction, and reliance on decision factors.

Result: Most LLMs struggle with consistency across domains; accuracy often masks unfaithfulness, with rationales not matching prediction drivers.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for deeper understanding evaluation protocols beyond accuracy, advocating for new frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DTL outperforms traditional ML in predicting post-CI language development in children with SNHL, achieving high accuracy (92.39%), sensitivity (91.22%), and specificity (93.56%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cochlear implant outcomes vary widely in children with SNHL, and current predictors like age at implantation or residual hearing are unreliable. This study explores better prediction methods.

Method: The study compared traditional ML and DTL algorithms using brain neuroanatomic features to predict language outcomes (high vs. low improvers) in 278 children with SNHL. DTL used a bilinear attention-based fusion strategy.

Result: DTL achieved superior performance (accuracy: 92.39%, AUC: 0.977) compared to traditional ML, capturing discriminative and task-specific information more effectively.

Conclusion: DTL is feasible for global CI programs to predict language outcomes, offering significant improvements over traditional ML.

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

*Yan Gao,Yazheng Yang,Zhibin Lan,Yidong Chen,Min Zhang,Daimeng Wei,Hui Huang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing Large Language Models with a Mixture of Experts speech projector and a multi-stage training paradigm to address challenges in Code-Switching speech translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching speech translation is challenging due to complex semantic modeling and scarce data. Existing methods rely on implicit learning or costly annotations.

Method: Introduces a Mixture of Experts speech projector for fine-grained modeling and a multi-stage training paradigm using monolingual ASR and ST data. Uses language-specific and load balancing losses, plus a transition loss.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach's effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: The proposed method mitigates limitations of previous approaches, improving performance in code-switching speech translation.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

*Filippo Morbiato,Luca Romano,Alessandro Persona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GVF Finetuning enhances visual factual consistency in MLLMs by integrating factual signals through data augmentation, instruction tuning, and a consistency loss, outperforming standard methods without compromising general abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual hallucinations in MLLMs undermine reliability, and existing fine-tuning methods inadequately address factual reasoning.

Method: GVF Finetuning uses Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, and Factual Consistency Loss to improve factual consistency.

Result: GVF significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on VHTest and maintains performance on general benchmarks like MME and POPE.

Conclusion: GVF effectively mitigates visual hallucinations while preserving general MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and advocate for the use of LLMs in materials science, emphasizing the advantages of open-source models for transparency and community-driven innovation.

Method: Review recent applications of LLMs in materials science, focusing on text mining, predictive modeling, and multi-agent experimental coordination. Benchmark open-source models against closed-source ones.

Result: Open-source LLMs perform comparably to closed-source models while offering benefits like transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.

TL;DR: A framework for continual learning in text-to-SQL leverages human feedback to refine queries and store reusable knowledge, improving accuracy over time, as shown by experiments on the BIRD benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge when generating SQL queries, so the paper aims to enhance their adaptability and accuracy through human feedback.

Method: The paper introduces a framework where a learning agent refines SQL queries using natural language feedback, distills knowledge for reuse, and stores it in structured memory. Multiple agent architectures are evaluated, focusing on capturing and retrieving past experiences.

Result: Memory-augmented agents, especially the Procedural Agent, show significant accuracy gains and error reduction on the BIRD benchmark by utilizing human-in-the-loop feedback.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the value of converting human expertise into reusable knowledge, enabling more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that learn continually.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate SQL queries from natural language questions but struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge. We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences. Experiments on the BIRD benchmark Dev set show that memory-augmented agents, particularly the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback. Our results highlight the importance of transforming tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, paving the way for more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from a human-in-the-loop.

*Ye Jiang,Taihang Wang,Youzheng Liu,Yimin Wang,Yuhan Xia,Yunfei Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage method (TopK + L2D) for selecting in-context demonstrations in text classification, focusing on both semantic similarity and label distribution alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current demonstration selection methods prioritize semantic similarity but neglect label distribution alignment, limiting performance in ICL for text classification.

Method: A fine-tuned BERT-like SLM is used to generate label distributions and calculate divergence (L2D), combined with TopK selection for semantically similar demonstrations.

Result: The proposed method outperforms previous strategies across seven benchmarks, showing a correlation between LLM performance and SLM accuracy.

Conclusion: Aligning label distributions with semantic similarity improves ICL performance, highlighting the importance of accurate SLMs for label estimation.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight, accurate pre-attention expert prediction method for MoE LLMs, improving prefetching accuracy by ~15% over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing expert prediction methods in MoE LLMs suffer from low accuracy and computational overhead due to reliance on previous layer activations or complex networks. The goal is to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Proposes pre-attention expert prediction using activations before the attention block in the same layer, leveraging ranking-preserving functions with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss.

Result: Achieves 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing ~15% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method offers an accurate and lightweight solution for expert prefetching in MoE LLMs, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow, integrates LCA taxonomy with LLM reasoning to generate accurate LCA process info, reducing cost and effort compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change and GHG emissions from consumer products necessitate tools like LCAs to estimate environmental impact, prompting the development of SpiderGen.

Method: SpiderGen combines traditional LCA taxonomy with LLM capabilities to generate LCA procedural info, evaluated against real-world LCA documents.

Result: SpiderGen achieves 62% F1-Score, showing accuracy with minor errors, and outperforms baselines like chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: SpiderGen significantly reduces cost (<$1 USD) and time (<10 mins) for LCA process info, offering a scalable solution over costly traditional LCAs.

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLM alignment methods affect responses to prompt attacks, finding that small prompt changes can significantly alter attack success rates, indicating limitations in current attack benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the sensitivity of LLM alignment methods to prompt attacks and assess the adequacy of existing attack benchmarks.

Method: Selected open-source LLMs aligned via SFT, DPO, and RLHF; conducted statistical analysis on ASR sensitivity to prompt variations.

Result: Small prompt modifications significantly impact ASR, revealing vulnerabilities not captured by current benchmarks.

Conclusion: Existing attack benchmarks may miss vulnerabilities; systematic, statistical analysis is needed to evaluate alignment methods effectively.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLM robustness using multi-turn prompts, Markov chains, and linear probes, revealing significant accuracy drops (~10%) and fragility under repeated questioning, proposing stationary accuracy as a key metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM robustness in real-world interactive settings due to increasing user-model interactions.

Method: Used multi-turn follow-up prompts, Markov chains for accuracy dynamics, and linear probes to predict answer changes.

Result: Found ~10% accuracy drop (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash), modeled accuracy dynamics with Markov chains (~8% drop in stationary accuracy), and showed linear probes predict changes.

Conclusion: Stationary accuracy is a critical robustness metric; addressing model instability under repeated questioning is vital for high-stakes deployments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

TL;DR: Recursive prompting with LLMs can amplify or reduce gender bias depending on initial bias levels and mitigation strategies, with contrastive augmentation showing significant downstream bias reduction despite higher semantic similarity scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how gender bias evolves across recursive text generation and evaluate mitigation strategies to ensure responsible synthetic data generation.

Method: Used three evaluation frameworks (rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, downstream task performance) with varying initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and tested four mitigation strategies.

Result: Low initial bias amplified (+36%), high initial bias decayed (-26%) toward the model's inherent bias level. Contrastive augmentation reduced downstream bias significantly (98.8% for low bias, 91% average) despite higher embedding-based scores.

Conclusion: Multidimensional evaluation is crucial for responsible synthetic data generation, as semantic similarity metrics may not align with behavioral fairness outcomes.

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the hidden language of multimodal systems by analyzing their preference bias through a multi-round 'telephone game,' revealing biases, generalization capabilities, and concept connections. It introduces Telescope, a dataset for this framework, and uses Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal systems' black-box nature obscures their understanding of the world. The study aims to decode their hidden language by leveraging their inherent biases during image-text-image transformations.

Method: A multi-round 'telephone game' is used to observe shifts in concept co-occurrence during image reconstruction. Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, supports this framework. Reasoning-LLMs analyze unexpected relationships.

Result: The method identifies preference biases, assesses generalization capabilities, and reveals stable pathways for fragile concept connections. It also uncovers relationships beyond textual and visual similarities.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into multimodal systems' hidden language, aiding future research on interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

TL;DR: Squid Game introduces a dynamic, adversarial evaluation environment to assess LLMs' abilities under pressure, revealing potential issues with static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks may not accurately evaluate LLMs due to data contamination and lack of adversarial scenarios.

Method: Developed Squid Game, a six-level adversarial evaluation framework testing multi-faceted LLM abilities against other LLMs.

Result: Revealed generational performance differences and speculative shortcuts in LLMs, suggesting static benchmark limitations.

Conclusion: Dynamic adversarial evaluation complements static benchmarks, providing deeper insights into LLM behavior.

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study shows AI text-to-speech systems implicitly learn to slow speech rate for politeness, replicating human social cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI systems internalize implicit human social conventions like speech rate changes for politeness.

Method: Prompted 22 synthetic voices from AI Studio and OpenAI to read scripts under polite/formal vs. casual/informal conditions and measured speech duration.

Result: Polite prompts led to slower speech with large effect sizes, statistically significant for most voices.

Conclusion: AI can implicitly learn psychological nuances of human communication, reinforcing human social norms.

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

TL;DR: The paper explores where instruction-following begins in neural networks by introducing datasets and measuring layer-wise flip rates, identifying an 'onset' point where interventions become ineffective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the transition point in neural networks where reading instructions shifts to executing them.

Method: Introduces three datasets and measures layer-wise flip rates using activation patching on contrastive prompts.

Result: Identifies an 'onset' point in the layer stack where interventions no longer affect predictions, consistent across tasks and model sizes.

Conclusion: Provides a replicable method to locate the start of instruction-following in neural networks.

Abstract: Following an instruction involves distinct sub-processes, such as reading content, reading the instruction, executing it, and producing an answer. We ask where, along the layer stack, instruction following begins, the point where reading gives way to doing. We introduce three simple datasets (Key-Value, Quote Attribution, Letter Selection) and two hop compositions of these tasks. Using activation patching on minimal-contrast prompt pairs, we measure a layer-wise flip rate that indicates when substituting selected residual activations changes the predicted answer. Across models in the Llama family, we observe an inflection point, which we term onset, where interventions that change predictions before this point become largely ineffective afterward. Multi-hop compositions show a similar onset location.

*Jonghyeon Choi,Yeonjun Choi,Hyun-chul Kim,Beakcheol Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores nation-level biases in LLMs using a UNSC-based framework, finding biases vary by model and context. It introduces a debiasing method combining retrieval and self-reflection, showing effectiveness in reducing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess and mitigate nation-level biases in LLMs, particularly in the context of International Relations, where biased outputs can have significant real-world implications.

Method: Developed a bias evaluation framework using UNSC historical records, with three tests. Proposed a debiasing framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Reflexion-based self-reflection.

Result: LLMs exhibit varying biases toward UNSC permanent members, with stronger reasoning models showing less bias. The debiasing framework reduces bias and improves performance, especially in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

Conclusion: Nation-level bias in LLMs is multidimensional and context-dependent. Assessing bias alongside performance is crucial for LLM applications in IR, and the proposed debiasing method shows promise.

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PiAttention is a periodic sparse Transformer that improves upon sparse attention mechanisms by combining local neighborhoods, periodic skips, and adaptive fusion, achieving better performance and efficiency compared to RingAttention and dense attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of Transformers for long-range modeling is a bottleneck. Sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce costs but suffer from limited receptive fields and lack adaptability.

Method: PiAttention factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic π-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate, maintaining linear complexity per layer.

Result: PiAttention achieves superior receptive field growth (O(kL + πlogL)) compared to RingAttention (O(kL)) and outperforms it with 8.3% lower perplexity while using 50% fewer GPUs.

Conclusion: Periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination are crucial for efficient long-context modeling, making PiAttention a promising solution.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining TextRank-based extraction, medical NER, and LLMs to improve faithfulness in summarizing consumer health questions, showing consistent improvements in quality and faithfulness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faithful summarization of consumer health questions is crucial to avoid misrepresenting medical details and ensure safe communication in healthcare.

Method: The framework integrates TextRank-based sentence extraction, medical named entity recognition, and fine-tuned LLaMA-2-7B models on English (MeQSum) and Bangla (BanglaCHQ-Summ) datasets.

Result: The approach outperformed zero-shot baselines and prior systems in quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, with over 80% of summaries preserving critical medical information in human evaluation.

Conclusion: Faithfulness is essential for reliable medical summarization, and the proposed framework shows promise for safer LLM deployment in healthcare.

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4o for grading short-answer quizzes and project reports in a Computational Linguistics course, finding strong correlation with human graders but variability in technical, open-ended responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the alignment of LLMs like GPT-4o with human evaluation in educational tasks, addressing underexplored real-world classroom applications.

Method: Collect responses from 50 students across five quizzes and project reports from 14 teams; compare GPT-4o's scores with independent TA evaluations.

Result: GPT-4o achieves high correlation (up to 0.98) and 55% exact score agreement with human graders for quizzes. For reports, it aligns well but shows variability in technical scoring.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading, contributing to automated assessment research in academic settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

*Abir Harrasse,Florent Draye,Zhijing Jin,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how multilingual LLMs represent diverse languages internally, finding evidence for pivot-language representations where early layers are shared across languages, and later layers decode language-specific features. Performance favors the dominant training language due to reliance on high-frequency language features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how multilingual LLMs internally manage diverse languages, particularly why performance favors the dominant training language despite shared representations.

Method: The authors train LLMs on various multilingual data mixtures and analyze them using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs.

Result: Results show pivot-language representations: early layers are shared, while later layers decode language-specific features. Attribution analyses reveal decoding relies on high-frequency language features.

Conclusion: Understanding pivot-language mechanisms is key to improving multilingual alignment in LLMs. Interventions on language features can alter model outputs, indicating potential for better language balance.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

### [145] [Reinforcing Stereotypes of Anger: Emotion AI on African American Vernacular English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10846)
*Rebecca Dorn,Christina Chance,Casandra Rusti,Charles Bickham,Kai-Wei Chang,Fred Morstatter,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals bias in emotion detection models, showing higher false positive anger rates in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) compared to General American English (GAE), reinforcing racial stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of emotion recognition models that rely on dominant cultural norms, which exclude dialects like AAVE, leading to biased outcomes.

Method: Analysis of 2.7 million geo-tagged tweets from Los Angeles, scoring AAVE strength and collecting emotion annotations from ingroup (AAVE-fluent) annotators. Models like GPT, BERT, and SpanEmo are evaluated.

Result: Models exhibit significantly higher false positive anger rates for AAVE (60%) compared to GAE (25%). Neighborhoods with more African American residents correlate with higher anger predictions (r = 0.27) and lower joy predictions (r = -0.10).

Conclusion: The study highlights a safety issue in emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes and calls for culturally informed affective computing systems.

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

TL;DR: Task arithmetic improves skill transfer in LLMs by aligning parameter spaces first, overcoming negative interference and enhancing adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address negative interference in task arithmetic by aligning models' parameter spaces for better skill transfer.

Method: Align parameter spaces using permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries, adapted for GQA and SwiGLU layers via weight-based and activation-based approaches.

Result: Outperforms standard task arithmetic in transferring advanced reasoning skills on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides an effective approach for merging skills across LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and improving adaptability.

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' reliability in judging social tasks was tested by reframing factual queries as conversational judgments and applying rebuttals, revealing varying conviction levels and a 9.24% performance change due to dialogue context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can reliably assess tasks requiring social or conversational judgment by evaluating their conviction under reframed tasks and rebuttals.

Method: Compared LLM performance on direct factual queries versus conversational judgments (dialogue context) and applied rebuttals to measure conviction maintenance.

Result: Models like GPT-4o-mini showed sycophantic tendencies, while Llama-8B-Instruct became overly-critical, with a 9.24% average performance change due to dialogue framing.

Conclusion: Conversational framing significantly impacts LLM judgment, highlighting its importance in evaluation and aiding the development of trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Conclusion: ICX360 provides accessible tools for LLM explainability, aiding transparency in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions.

*Jongyoon Song,Sangwon Yu,Sungroh Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores format-level negative bias in LLMs, showing prompts influence responses more than semantics. It introduces a pipeline to categorize questions based on model knowledge, revealing shortcut behaviors and prompting effects on bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand detailed factors behind negative bias in LLMs, particularly how prompt formats and lack of knowledge contribute to negative responses.

Method: A pipeline constructs an evaluation set categorizing questions by model knowledge (correct, incorrect, insufficient). Analyzes prompt scenarios (context, 'I don't know' option, chain-of-thought).

Result: Models shortcut to negative responses when lacking knowledge. Context and 'I don't know' reduce bias; chain-of-thought amplifies it. Prompt type affects bias degree.

Conclusion: Negative bias in LLMs is influenced by prompt formats and knowledge gaps. Mitigation strategies include adjusting prompts and providing context or uncertainty options.

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Result: MedPath facilitates training and evaluation of semantic-rich EL systems and supports interoperable, explainable clinical NLP models.

Conclusion: MedPath addresses existing challenges and enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) improve accuracy but often sacrifice reasoning quality, termed Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM). A benchmark reveals trade-offs, and a new framework aims to balance tool use and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) truly enhance reasoning or just substitute it when solving complex tasks like mathematical problems.

Method: A benchmark (PYMATH) evaluates TaLMs' reasoning degradation. Multi-dimensional metrics compare tool-augmented and non-tool models. A preference-based framework improves tool-assisted reasoning.

Result: TaLMs gain accuracy (up to 19.3%) but suffer reasoning degradation (e.g., non-tool models win 41.5% more in reasoning comparisons). TIM occurs in ~55% of high-risk cases.

Conclusion: Tool use must be carefully balanced with reasoning quality. Proposed framework enhances both accuracy and reasoning depth.

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use. Codes and data are available at: https://github.com/megagonlabs/TIM.

TL;DR: EMSQA introduces a specialized medical QA dataset and two expert-driven methods (Expert-CoT and ExpertRAG) to improve LLM performance in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack domain-specific expertise in medical QA, ignoring critical contextual elements like clinical subject areas and certification levels.

Method: EMSQA dataset (24.3K questions) is paired with Expert-CoT (context-aware prompting) and ExpertRAG (retrieval-augmented generation leveraging subject-aligned documents).

Result: Expert-CoT improves accuracy by 2.05% over vanilla CoT, while ExpertRAG adds 4.59% over standard RAG. Combined, they enable LLMs to pass certification exams.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific expertise via structured prompting and retrieval enhances LLM performance in high-stakes medical QA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating academic workflows, existing systems for academic peer review remain constrained by text-only inputs, limited contextual grounding, and a lack of actionable feedback. In this work, we present an interactive web-based system for multimodal, community-aware peer review simulation to enable effective manuscript revisions before paper submission. Our framework integrates textual and visual information through multimodal LLMs, enhances review quality via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounded in web-scale OpenReview data, and converts generated reviews into actionable to-do lists using the proposed Action:Objective[\#] format, providing structured and traceable guidance. The system integrates seamlessly into existing academic writing platforms, providing interactive interfaces for real-time feedback and revision tracking. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating more comprehensive and useful reviews aligned with expert standards, surpassing ablated baselines and advancing transparent, human-centered scholarly assistance.

*Ramya Kumar,Dhruv Gulwani,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes using Bloom's Taxonomy, comparing traditional ML, RNNs, transformers, and LLMs. SVM with augmentation performed best (94% accuracy), while LLMs like OpenAI and Gemini achieved ~0.72-0.73 accuracy in zero-shot evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify educational content automatically according to Bloom's Taxonomy, aiding educators in assessing cognitive levels efficiently.

Method: Compared traditional ML (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM), RNNs (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformers (BERT, RoBERTa), and LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) on a labeled dataset of 600 sentences. Evaluated with preprocessing and augmentation strategies.

Result: SVM with augmentation achieved highest accuracy (94%). RNNs and BERT overfitted; RoBERTa initially resisted but showed overfitting later. LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini) scored ~0.72-0.73 accuracy in zero-shot tests.

Conclusion: Simpler models like SVM with augmentation outperform complex deep models on limited data. LLMs show promise in zero-shot tasks but require further optimization.

Abstract: This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model trained on cardiology textbooks, significantly outperforms existing models in clinical cardiology tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical text embeddings rely on PubMed research literature, missing clinical procedural knowledge and terminology from cardiology textbooks, limiting effectiveness for clinical applications.

Method: Trained CardioEmbed using contrastive learning on seven cardiology textbooks (150,000 sentences) with InfoNCE loss and in-batch negatives.

Result: Achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy (+15.94 points over MedTE) and competitive scores on MTEB benchmarks (BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman, SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10).

Conclusion: Domain-specialized training on clinical textbooks enhances retrieval accuracy for cardiology, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoX, a benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation, along with Metric-S, an evaluation system. It highlights the gap between LLMs and human experts in professional-grade translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current translation evaluation methods lack focus on discourse-level coherence and terminological precision in expert domains. DiscoX aims to address this gap.

Method: DiscoX includes 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, evaluated using Metric-S, a reference-free assessment system for accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness.

Result: Metric-S outperforms existing metrics and shows strong consistency with human judgments. Advanced LLMs still significantly lag behind human experts on DiscoX tasks.

Conclusion: DiscoX and Metric-S provide a robust framework for rigorous evaluation, emphasizing the challenges in achieving professional-grade machine translation.

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

*Aladin Djuhera,Farhan Ahmed,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Syed Zawad,Heiko Ludwig,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of open-source DPO datasets, uses Magpie for annotations, and introduces UltraMix, a new, smaller yet better-performing DPO mixture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic comparisons among DPO datasets due to high computational costs and sparse annotations, the study aims to analyze and improve preference optimization datasets.

Method: The authors use the Magpie framework to annotate samples for task category, input quality, and preference reward. They then curate UltraMix, a selective blend of five DPO datasets, removing noisy or redundant samples.

Result: UltraMix is 30% smaller than the top-performing dataset but outperforms it across benchmarks. Structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins are revealed.

Conclusion: The study provides scalable, fine-grained insights into DPO datasets and releases UltraMix, annotations, and metadata to support future research in data-centric preference optimization.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structured generation methods for LLMs often lack output diversity, limiting their practical utility.

Method: The approach uses automata traversal history to guide LLMs towards novel structural patterns.

Result: Evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in both structural and content diversity without sacrificing generation efficiency.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances diversity in structured generation, as shown in a case study generating diverse test cases for open-source libraries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

*Xingyu Ren,Youran Sun,Haoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a consistent bias in text embedding models and proposes a training-free solution called Renormalization, which significantly improves performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the consistent bias observed in text embedding models, where embedding vectors can be decomposed into a biased component and a neutral component.

Method: The method involves two variants of Renormalization: directly subtracting the bias component or subtracting its projection from the embedding vector.

Result: Renormalization improves performance by 9.7σ on retrieval, 3.1σ on classification, and 0.8σ on other tasks across 38 models.

Conclusion: The conclusion confirms that Renormalization effectively mitigates bias and enhances model performance, with the projection-based variant performing better as predicted.

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can identify their own hallucinated facts, addressing reliability concerns.

Method: Formulated hallucination detection as a classification task using CoT to extract knowledge from LLMs' parameters.

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo with CoT detected 58.2% of its own hallucinations.

Conclusion: LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if they contain sufficient knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personal attacks in debates shape public perception, and detecting them can improve political transparency and provide insights for various stakeholders.

Method: Manual annotation of debate transcripts from 2016, 2020, and 2024 elections, followed by statistical and language-model analysis using fine-tuned transformers and general-purpose LLMs.

Result: The study shows the effectiveness of task-specific adaptation of modern language models in detecting personal attacks in political speech.

Conclusion: Adapting language models for specific tasks like detecting personal attacks can deepen understanding of political communication.

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

TL;DR: AV-Dialog is a multimodal framework using audio and visual cues to improve dialogue models in noisy settings, outperforming audio-only approaches in transcription, turn-taking, and response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue models struggle in noisy, multi-speaker environments, leading to irrelevant responses and poor turn-taking. AV-Dialog aims to solve this by leveraging multimodal cues.

Method: AV-Dialog combines acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on diverse datasets (monadic, synthetic, real) to track speakers, predict turns, and generate responses.

Result: The framework reduces transcription errors, improves turn-taking prediction, and enhances dialogue quality compared to audio-only models, especially under interference.

Conclusion: AV-Dialog demonstrates the advantage of multimodal (audio-visual) cues for robust, speaker-aware dialogue systems in real-world noisy environments.

Abstract: Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoDetector, a novel framework for Meme Emotion Understanding, uses MLLMs for textual enhancement and dual-stage fusion to outperform existing methods on MEU tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in MEU: lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion and insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings.

Method: Four-step textual enhancement with MLLMs and dual-stage modal fusion for nuanced emotional cue capture.

Result: Improves F1 scores by 4.3% on MET-MEME and 3.4% on MOOD datasets.

Conclusion: MemoDetector is effective and robust, advancing MEU by leveraging enriched multimodal insights.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

TL;DR: SAP² is a novel ASR framework improving accuracy in contextualized scenarios by dynamically pruning/integrating keywords with speech-driven attention, achieving SOTA results on SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with long-context scenarios due to limited model windows and noise. SAP² aims to address this gap.

Method: Uses a two-stage framework with Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling to compress context embeddings while preserving speech-salient info.

Result: Achieves WERs of 7.71% (SlideSpeech) and 1.12% (LibriSpeech), reducing B-WER by 41.1% on SlideSpeech. Scalable under extensive contexts.

Conclusion: SAP² effectively leverages long-context information, outperforming baselines and demonstrating robustness in contextual ASR tasks.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new supersense typology for adverbs in WordNet, validated through annotation, improving coverage and supporting NLP applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverbs in WordNet lack systematic semantic classification compared to nouns and verbs, limiting its utility for NLP tasks.

Method: A linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs was developed and empirically validated through human annotation.

Result: The typology covers major semantic domains and shows reliable annotation, enhancing WordNet's coverage and alignment with linguistic theory.

Conclusion: The proposed supersense categories improve WordNet's adverb classification and support NLP applications like word sense disambiguation.

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

*Jader Martins Camboim de Sá,Jooyoung Lee,Cédric Pruski,Marcos Da Silveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LANE is an adversarial training strategy designed to improve fine-grained word meaning resolution in NLMs by focusing on target words and generating challenging negatives to enhance discriminative representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLMs often struggle with fine-grained word meaning resolution due to overfitting to global sentence representations. LANE addresses this by targeting local semantic details.

Method: LANE uses adversarial training to shift focus to target words, generating negative examples by marking alternate words in training data to improve separability.

Result: Experiments show LANE improves discriminative word representations, outperforming baselines in lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation.

Conclusion: LANE enhances NLMs' ability to capture subtle meaning differences and is model-agnostic, making it adaptable to existing frameworks.

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency issues in QA generation from KGs.

Method: Clusters KG triplets, creates reusable templates, refines them with LLMs, and selects distractors for answer options.

Result: Efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs with scalability, fluency, and linguistic precision.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively balances automation with linguistic refinement for QA generation.

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

Motivation: Recent successes in NLP highlight vulnerabilities in machine learning models, prompting research into adversarial attacks to improve model robustness.

Method: Develop adversarial attacks using machine/deep learning to create perplexing inputs, analyze datasets, and introduce Bangla Language examples.

Result: Novel adversarial attack strategies are created, focusing on maximizing model perplexity and testing robustness.

Conclusion: The study advances adversarial attack techniques, contributing to future improvements in model robustness and security.

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

TL;DR: LAET reduces computational costs for financial NLP tasks by fine-tuning only the most effective layers of LLMs, achieving better performance than larger models like GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of large language models limit accessibility for organizations, prompting a need for efficient alternatives.

Method: Proposes Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), which selectively fine-tunes critical layers of pre-trained LLMs while freezing less important ones.

Result: LAET outperforms benchmarks and LLMs like GPT-4 in financial NLP tasks, even with smaller models (~3B parameters).

Conclusion: LAET provides an efficient and scalable solution for deploying advanced financial NLP models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with Lao tasks despite advancements, indicating gaps in language mastery.

Conclusion: LaoBench aims to spur AI research for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.

TL;DR: LMs and infants find attested languages easier than impossible ones, but LMs often learn both equally well, lacking human biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand if LMs share human inductive biases in language learning.

Method: Review literature comparing LM and infant language learning abilities.

Result: LMs learn attested and impossible languages similarly; harder ones are just more complex.

Conclusion: LMs lack human inductive biases that aid language acquisition.

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create hearing assistants that proactively adapt to conversational dynamics without explicit user prompts, improving usability in multi-conversation settings.

Method: The system uses egocentric binaural audio and self-speech as an anchor, employing a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model for low-latency processing and a slower model for capturing longer-range dynamics.

Result: Tests on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversations (6.8 hours from 11 participants) show effective generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners.

Conclusion: This work advances proactive hearing assistants by adapting to conversational dynamics, marking progress toward more intuitive and efficient hearing aids.

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

TL;DR: W2S-AlignTree introduces a plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework combining Monte Carlo Tree Search and Weak-to-Strong Generalization, improving LLM outputs without modifying model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the misalignment of LLM outputs with human preferences and the scalability limitations of existing alignment methods like RLHF.

Method: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search and Weak-to-Strong Generalization, leveraging weak models' signals for fine-grained control during strong model generation.

Result: Consistently outperforms baselines, improving Llama3-8B's summarization performance by 15.9%.

Conclusion: W2S-AlignTree offers a scalable, adaptable, and effective solution for aligning LLM outputs with human preferences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet their outputs often suffer from misalignment with human preferences due to the inadequacy of weak supervision and a lack of fine-grained control. Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate AI models realistically in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical outcomes are crucial.

Method: PRBench includes 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, validated through rigorous quality checks. It evaluates 20 leading models.

Result: Top model scores are low (0.39 in Finance, 0.37 in Legal), revealing gaps like inaccurate judgments and incomplete reasoning.

Conclusion: PRBench highlights major limitations in current AI models for professional tasks, emphasizing the need for improvement in reliability and transparency.

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

Motivation: Addresses the challenge of real-time energy forecasting on edge devices for smart grid and building optimization.

Method: Uses a hybrid approach with dual branches: one for temporal lags and another with dilated TCNs to capture dependencies.

Result: Achieves 14.49% MAPE at 1-hour horizon with 18ms inference time, outperforming LSTM and TCN baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for industrial applications in energy optimization and demand management.

Abstract: Real-time energy forecasting on edge devices represents a major challenge for smart grid optimization and intelligent buildings. We present LAD-BNet (Lag-Aware Dual-Branch Network), an innovative neural architecture optimized for edge inference with Google Coral TPU. Our hybrid approach combines a branch dedicated to explicit exploitation of temporal lags with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) featuring dilated convolutions, enabling simultaneous capture of short and long-term dependencies. Tested on real energy consumption data with 10-minute temporal resolution, LAD-BNet achieves 14.49% MAPE at 1-hour horizon with only 18ms inference time on Edge TPU, representing an 8-12 x acceleration compared to CPU. The multi-scale architecture enables predictions up to 12 hours with controlled performance degradation. Our model demonstrates a 2.39% improvement over LSTM baselines and 3.04% over pure TCN architectures, while maintaining a 180MB memory footprint suitable for embedded device constraints. These results pave the way for industrial applications in real-time energy optimization, demand management, and operational planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance trade-offs in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer for long-tailed datasets. It introduces LT-Soups, a two-stage framework, to balance accuracy between head and tail classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often have long-tailed distributions, where PEFT methods improve tail-class performance but degrade head-class accuracy. The head-tail ratio is identified as a key factor.

Method: LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets (Stage 1) and fine-tunes classifiers on full datasets (Stage 2) to address bias and improve accuracy.

Result: LT-Soups outperforms PEFT and traditional model soups across various imbalance regimes, achieving better trade-offs.

Conclusion: LT-Soups effectively balances head and tail class accuracy in long-tailed datasets, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

*Zitong Zhang,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel differentiable sparse identification framework for discovering governing equations from noisy data in nonlinear dynamics, using cubic B-Spline approximation and recursive derivative computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with rational functions, noise sensitivity, and limited data in Lagrangian system identification.

Method: Integrates cubic B-Spline approximation, robust equation discovery with physical constraints, and recursive derivative computation.

Result: Superior performance in extracting physical laws from noisy data, especially in complex mechanical systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses key limitations and improves accuracy and reliability in system identification.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BREP ReFT improves ReFT's performance on mathematical reasoning tasks by optimizing initial reasoning prefixes, preventing early inference errors, and avoiding numerical encoding disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReFT methods, while efficient, struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks due to poor early reasoning prefixes and numerical encoding issues.

Method: BREP ReFT truncates training data for better initial prefixes, intervenes early to prevent errors, and constrains intervention vectors.

Result: BREP ReFT outperforms standard ReFT and PEFT methods in mathematical reasoning across diverse model architectures.

Conclusion: BREP ReFT addresses ReFT's limitations in mathematical tasks, offering superior efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied reliability concerns and uncertainty quantification in generative models' distribution approximation capabilities.

Method: Proposes formalizing uncertainty quantification and explores ensemble-based precision-recall curves as a potential solution, tested on synthetic datasets.

Result: Preliminary experiments show aggregated precision-recall curves effectively capture model approximation uncertainty, aiding systematic comparisons of architectures.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of uncertainty quantification in generative models and demonstrates promising tools for its measurement.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

TL;DR: An automated FIM score estimation method using deep learning (ST-GCN, BiLSTM, attention) replaces traditional assessments, accurately identifying patient independence levels and revealing key movement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the burden of traditional FIM assessments on patients and healthcare professionals by automating score estimation with simpler exercises.

Method: Deep neural network combining ST-GCN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies and key body-joint contributions.

Result: Achieves 70.09-78.79% balanced accuracy in distinguishing independent patients; identifies specific movement patterns as predictors.

Conclusion: Automated FIM estimation offers a viable, less burdensome alternative to traditional methods, with potential clinical utility.

Abstract: The functional independence measure (FIM) is widely used to evaluate patients' physical independence in activities of daily living. However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items. Additionally, our analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluation items.

TL;DR: The paper introduces matrix-free methods for analyzing the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) using trace estimation, enabling efficient computation of its properties like trace and alignment. It also proposes one-sided estimators for further speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the infeasibility of computing the full NTK matrix, especially for recurrent architectures, by introducing efficient matrix-free methods.

Method: The authors use trace estimation techniques, specifically Hutch++, and propose one-sided estimators leveraging automatic differentiation modes to compute NTK properties efficiently.

Result: The approach achieves significant speedups (orders of magnitude) in computing NTK properties, especially in low-sample regimes, due to the efficiency of matrix-free and one-sided methods.

Conclusion: Matrix-free randomized methods, including one-sided estimators, provide practical and scalable solutions for analyzing the NTK, making its applications more feasible.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

Motivation: Existing greedy optimization methods for LPC lack global optimality and struggle with non-separable clusters, while MIP-based solutions suffer from poor scalability.

Method: Proposes two approaches leveraging theoretical properties of separability: (1) near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds to simplify MIP, and (2) approximating LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem.

Result: Demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets, the methods achieve near-optimal solutions with lower regression errors than greedy optimization and better scalability than MIP.

Conclusion: The new approaches offer efficient, scalable global optimization for LPC, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and computational performance.

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

### [187] [Transformers know more than they can tell -- Learning the Collatz sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10811)
*François Charton,Ashvni Narayanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transformer models' prediction accuracy for long Collatz steps, finding accuracy varies by encoding base and revealing a common learning pattern tied to residual classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer models learn and predict complex arithmetic functions like the Collatz sequence, and to uncover the underlying mathematical properties they exploit.

Method: Train transformer models to predict long Collatz steps using different encoding bases, analyze their accuracy and learning patterns, and examine failure cases.

Result: Models achieve high accuracy (up to 99.7%) for certain bases and learn input classes sharing residuals modulo 2^p, aligning with Collatz sequence properties. Most errors involve predictable loop-length misestimations, not hallucinations.

Conclusion: The difficulty lies in learning the control structure (loop lengths) of the computation. The approach can be extended to other problems to improve understanding and performance of language models.

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of training neural operators by leveraging transfer learning.

Method: Evaluating transformer-based neural operators in a general transfer learning setting across various PDE problems.

Result: Demonstrates effective transfer of knowledge across PDE problems, including unseen parameters and new variables.

Conclusion: Advanced neural operator architectures can successfully transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

TL;DR: Quantum kernel methods show promise in machine learning but lack verification on real-world data. This study introduces a variational quantum kernel framework, tests it on diverse datasets, and finds it outperforms classical kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to verify the practical advantage of quantum kernel methods on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data, which current research lacks.

Method: Developed a variational quantum kernel framework with resource-efficient ansätze and a parameter scaling technique for faster convergence. Benchmarked on eight diverse datasets.

Result: The proposed quantum kernel outperformed classical kernels like RBF in classification tasks on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Properly designed quantum kernels can be versatile and high-performance tools for real-world machine learning, though further research is needed to confirm quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

*Sanchit Kabra,Shobhnik Kriplani,Parshin Shojaee,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurfaceBench is introduced as a comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by focusing on surface-level structure, scientific grounding, and robust evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for symbolic regression suffer from oversimplified tasks, lack of domain grounding, and reliance on brittle metrics. SurfaceBench aims to overcome these by providing a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction.

Method: SurfaceBench includes 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, featuring explicit, implicit, and parametric equation forms. Tasks are designed to resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions and are grounded in scientific domains. Evaluation combines symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances.

Result: Experiments show that state-of-the-art frameworks struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities, highlighting SurfaceBench's diagnostic value.

Conclusion: SurfaceBench establishes a principled benchmark for evaluating progress in compositional generalization, scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs, filling critical gaps in existing symbolic regression benchmarks.

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

*Ansel Kaplan Erol,Seungjun Lee,Divya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EarthSight is a distributed runtime framework for satellite image intelligence, optimizing onboard computation and ground-station scheduling to reduce latency and resource strain in satellite constellations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional satellite image processing pipelines suffer from delays due to bandwidth limits, and existing onboard ML solutions are inefficient and non-scalable. EarthSight aims to improve latency and resource usage.

Method: EarthSight employs multi-task inference onboard satellites, ground-station query scheduling, and dynamic filter ordering to prioritize and process high-value imagery efficiently.

Result: EarthSight reduces compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile latency from 51 to 21 minutes compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: EarthSight enables scalable, low-latency satellite image analysis by integrating global context and adaptive resource decisions, improving mission responsiveness.

Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

*Elyes Hajji,Aymen Bouguerra,Fabio Arnez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to distinguish and evaluate hallucination types in LLMs, proposing attention-based aggregation for better detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to hallucinations in safety-critical domains, but existing detection methods are computationally expensive and overlook hallucination distinctions.

Method: The authors propose a framework differentiating extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, using attention-based uncertainty quantification and novel aggregation strategies.

Result: Sampling-based methods work well for extrinsic hallucinations but fail on intrinsic ones, while attention aggregation performs better for intrinsic hallucinations.

Conclusion: Attention-based methods offer rich signals for hallucination detection and align strategies with hallucination types, improving interpretability and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

*YongKyung Oh,Dong-Young Lim,Sungil Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowPath introduces an invertible neural flow to model the control path's geometry in neural controlled differential equations, improving accuracy for irregular time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use simplistic interpolation schemes that misrepresent data manifolds, especially with high missingness. FlowPath aims to address this by learning a data-adaptive manifold.

Method: FlowPath employs an invertible neural flow to construct a continuous and information-preserving control path, guided by invertibility constraints.

Result: FlowPath outperforms baselines on 18 benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Learning the path's geometry is crucial for robust and generalizable solutions in irregular time series analysis.

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses poor sample efficiency and training instability in RL by leveraging off-policy data for lower-variance return estimates, showing improved performance over on-policy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL algorithms suffer from high-variance return estimates, leading to inefficiency and instability. Recent off-policy evaluation results suggest better alternatives.

Method: Extends off-policy evaluation insights to online RL, using behavior policies for data collection to reduce variance. Tests this with policy-gradient methods.

Result: Demonstrates improved sample efficiency and performance across diverse environments compared to on-policy approaches.

Conclusion: Off-policy data collection can enhance RL algorithms by reducing variance in return estimates, offering better efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAMP, a lightweight adapter for EEG data using general time series foundation models, achieving performance comparable to EEG-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between general time series foundation models (TSFMs) and EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) by providing a comparative analysis and introducing an efficient adapter.

Method: The proposed STAMP adapter leverages univariate embeddings from TSFMs, implicitly models spatial-temporal EEG characteristics, and uses multi-head pooling. It’s evaluated on 8 EEG benchmark datasets for classification.

Result: STAMP performs comparably to state-of-the-art EEGFMs while being lightweight in parameters and flexible in accommodating inputs.

Conclusion: STAMP effectively enables general TSFMs to model EEG data, offering a practical and efficient alternative to EEG-specific foundation models.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExPairT-LLM is an exact learning algorithm for code selection that uses simpler LLM queries (pairwise membership and equivalence) to outperform state-of-the-art methods by up to +27.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code selection algorithms often fail due to misidentifying nonequivalent programs or incorrect LLM assumptions.

Method: ExPairT-LLM introduces pairwise membership and equivalence queries, simplifying LLM interaction and enabling a robust tournament-based selection.

Result: ExPairT-LLM improves pass@1 by +13.0% on average and up to +27.1% over state-of-the-art methods, and boosts complex reasoning LLMs by +24.0%.

Conclusion: ExPairT-LLM significantly advances code selection by leveraging simpler, more reliable LLM queries.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

### [197] [Private Zeroth-Order Optimization with Public Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10859)
*Xuchen Gong,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PAZO, a public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizer, to address high computation and memory costs of DP-SGD, achieving better privacy/utility tradeoffs and faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computation and memory costs of first-order DP algorithms like DP-SGD hinder deployment. Zeroth-order methods offer lower overhead but suffer from low utility. Public data can improve zeroth-order gradient approximation.

Method: PAZO leverages public data to guide and improve gradient approximation in zeroth-order optimizers, with minimal overhead.

Result: PAZO outperforms first-order baselines in privacy/utility tradeoffs, especially in highly private regimes, and offers up to 16× runtime speedup.

Conclusion: PAZO provides an efficient and effective alternative to first-order DP algorithms, demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code LLMs struggle with tasks like unit test generation due to data imbalance favoring raw code over broader software engineering tasks, especially in low-resource languages like Golang.

Method: Introduces GO UT Bench, a dataset of 5,264 Golang code-unit test pairs from diverse domains, used to fine-tune LLMs including mixture of experts and dense decoders.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperform base models on over 75% of benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: GO UT Bench effectively improves LLM performance for unit test generation in Golang, addressing data imbalance issues.

Abstract: Training data imbalance poses a major challenge for code LLMs. Most available data heavily over represents raw opensource code while underrepresenting broader software engineering tasks, especially in low resource languages like Golang. As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces G4RL, a graph encoder-decoder method to address limitations in Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL), improving subgoal representation and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCHRL methods rely on domain-specific knowledge or struggle with dynamic graph utilization, leading to inefficiencies and poor subgoal representation.

Method: Proposes G4RL, a graph encoder-decoder framework integrated into GCHRL methods for symmetric and reversible transition environments, trained on state graphs generated during exploration.

Result: Empirical results show G4RL enhances performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL methods with minimal computational overhead in dense and sparse reward settings.

Conclusion: G4RL effectively addresses GCHRL challenges, offering improved subgoal utilization and performance across relevant environments.

Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

Motivation: Overcoming the computational expense and lack of labeled data in conventional methods for estimating muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems.

Method: Proposes PI-MJCA-BiGRU, combining Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) with BiGRU layers and physics-informed loss functions to integrate inter-joint dynamics and external forces.

Result: Validated on two datasets, PI-MJCA-BiGRU matches supervised methods' performance without labeled data, with MJCA improving inter-joint coordination modeling.

Conclusion: PI-MJCA-BiGRU offers a time-efficient, label-free solution for estimating muscle dynamics, enhancing clinical assessment and assistive device control.

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

TL;DR: A novel Graph Attention Network (GAT) approach is proposed for accurately predicting power outage durations caused by severe weather, addressing spatial dependencies and heterogeneity, and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of power outage recovery is crucial for grid resilience, but existing methods face challenges like spatial dependency, heterogeneity, and limited data.

Method: The proposed method uses unsupervised pre-training followed by semi-supervised learning with GAT, tested on data from four hurricanes affecting 501 counties.

Result: The model achieves >93% accuracy, outperforming XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN, and simple GAT by 2%-15%.

Conclusion: The GAT-based approach effectively estimates power outage durations, demonstrating superior performance and addressing real-world challenges.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and winter storms have induced large-scale power outages in the U.S., resulting in tremendous economic and societal impacts. Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states. The model exhibits an excellent performance ($>93\%$ accuracy) and outperforms the existing methods XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN and simple GAT by $2\% - 15\%$ in both the overall performance and class-wise accuracy.

TL;DR: SPP-FGC is a novel federated clustering algorithm that uses local structural graphs for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, balancing performance and privacy better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated clustering methods compromise between performance and privacy, risking data leakage or reduced accuracy.

Method: SPP-FGC leverages local structural graphs for secure server aggregation, offering one-shot or iterative modes for different data types.

Result: Improves clustering accuracy by up to 10% (NMI) while ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: SPP-FGC outperforms federated baselines with provable privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

*Ying Song,Balaji Palanisamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper proposes GraphToxin, a graph reconstruction attack exposing vulnerabilities in graph unlearning, recovering deleted data and connections, and highlights ineffective defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses risks in graph unlearning, showing residual traces can be exploited to recover sensitive data, undermining privacy regulations.

Method: Introduces GraphToxin with a curvature matching module for precise recovery, tested under white-box and black-box settings.

Result: GraphToxin successfully recovers deleted data and connections, exposing severe privacy risks; current defenses fail.

Conclusion: Urges development of robust defenses against GraphToxin, revealing critical vulnerabilities in graph unlearning.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies cascade bandit models for edge inference, comparing four policies' regret guarantees, favoring LCB and Thompson Sampling for their adaptivity and constant regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by challenges in edge inference.

Method: Analyzes four policies: Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, LCB, and Thompson Sampling.

Result: LCB and Thompson Sampling achieve constant O(1) regret, outperforming Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination.

Conclusion: Adaptivity is crucial for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods suffer from high computational cost and complexity due to offline multi-objective optimization.

Method: Uses optimal linear transformation to correct model representations, enabling closed-form solution for preference-aware model generation.

Result: Generates superior Pareto front with precise preference alignment and linear complexity scaling.

Conclusion: The method achieves efficient on-the-fly model merging with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Unsupervised Robust Domain Adaptation (URDA), addressing the lack of robustness in UDA methods against adversarial attacks. It proposes Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART) and provides theoretical backing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness in UDA methods against adversarial attacks, which is often overlooked, while maintaining domain adaptability.

Method: Proposes URDA and DART, a two-step training procedure involving pre-training a UDA model and applying disentangled distillation for robustification.

Result: Experiments show DART improves robustness without compromising domain adaptability, validating URDA theory.

Conclusion: URDA and DART effectively tackle the entanglement challenge in UDA+VAT, offering a robust and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

*Brian Godwin Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework to enhance GNNs by incorporating broader local neighborhood context, proposing the SINC-GCN model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard message-passing GNNs lack broader neighborhood context, limiting their ability to learn complex relationships.

Method: Formalizes neighborhood-contextualization, extending it to NCMP, and develops SINC-GCN for practical implementation.

Result: Preliminary analysis shows improved expressivity and efficiency in synthetic node classification.

Conclusion: NCMP and SINC-GCN enhance GNN representational power by leveraging richer neighborhood context.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.

*Jun Hu,Shangheng Chen,Yufei He,Yuan Li,Bryan Hooi,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGNNs improve efficiency with pre-computation but face label leakage (echo effect). Echoless-LP solves this via PFEP, APS, and PostAdjust, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address training label leakage in pre-computation HGNNs, which limits efficiency and compatibility.

Method: Introduces Echoless-LP with PFEP (partition-focused echoless propagation), APS (asymmetric partitioning), and PostAdjust.

Result: Achieves better performance and memory efficiency on public datasets.

Conclusion: Echoless-LP effectively mitigates label leakage while maintaining efficiency and compatibility.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.

TL;DR: Scalable Population Training (ScaPT) improves zero-shot coordination by efficiently scaling population size with parameter sharing and diversity regularization, outperforming existing methods in Hanabi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot coordination methods are computationally limited and neglect performance gains from larger populations.

Method: Proposes ScaPT, featuring a meta-agent for parameter sharing and a mutual information regularizer for diversity.

Result: ScaPT outperforms existing frameworks in Hanabi, demonstrating superior zero-shot coordination.

Conclusion: ScaPT effectively addresses computational limits and enhances zero-shot coordination performance through scalable training.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predictive coding networks can be modeled as cellular sheaves, where sheaf cohomology helps identify irreducible errors and internal contradictions caused by feedback loops, aiding in network design and diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address issues like internal contradictions and irreducible errors in predictive coding networks, especially in recurrent topologies, using sheaf theory.

Method: Formulate linear PC networks as cellular sheaves, analyze error patterns via sheaf cohomology, and use Hodge decomposition to study feedback-induced contradictions.

Result: Sheaf theory provides tools to diagnose problematic configurations and guides effective weight initialization for recurrent PC networks.

Conclusion: The sheaf formalism enhances understanding and design of predictive coding networks, particularly in handling feedback loops and irreducible errors.

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) replaces global backpropagation with local optimization over weights and activations. We show that linear PC networks admit a natural formulation as cellular sheaves: the sheaf coboundary maps activations to edge-wise prediction errors, and PC inference is diffusion under the sheaf Laplacian. Sheaf cohomology then characterizes irreducible error patterns that inference cannot remove. We analyze recurrent topologies where feedback loops create internal contradictions, introducing prediction errors unrelated to supervision. Using a Hodge decomposition, we determine when these contradictions cause learning to stall. The sheaf formalism provides both diagnostic tools for identifying problematic network configurations and design principles for effective weight initialization for recurrent PC networks.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach with ​ourmodel provides an accurate, scalable solution for analyzing Dragonfly network interference.

Abstract: The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.

TL;DR: Proposes an informed embedding initialization strategy for continual learning in KGEs, improving accuracy, reducing forgetting, and speeding up training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of initializing embeddings for new entities in frequently updated KGs, which impacts accuracy and training efficiency.

Method: Utilizes KG schema and existing embeddings to initialize new entity representations based on their classes.

Result: Enhances predictive performance, knowledge retention, and reduces training time across various KGE models.

Conclusion: The strategy effectively integrates into existing continual learning methods, improving scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Conclusion: The proposed robust approaches offer efficient solutions for anomaly detection in large-scale financial data.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

Conclusion: Demonstrates explainable AI's potential for accurate and transparent precipitation forecasting in diverse urban climates.

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to minimize Jeffreys divergence by jointly training a proxy and main model, optimizing their priorities dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The forward KL divergence's asymmetry limits capturing target distribution properties, while symmetric alternatives like Jeffreys divergence are computationally challenging.

Method: Uses a proxy model alongside the main model, formulating joint training as constrained optimization to adapt priorities dynamically.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in combining NF and EBM strengths for tasks like density estimation, image generation, and inference.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for optimizing Jeffreys divergence, enhancing model performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurately predicting extreme climate events, specifically heat waves, to enhance forecasting reliability.

Method: Frames prediction as a classification problem, using power mean aggregation of ensemble predictions to improve accuracy.

Conclusion: The method shows adaptability and promise for improving extreme event predictions, varying effectiveness with quantile thresholds.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

Motivation: The goal is to enable real-time learning of complex, time-varying nonlinear models, which existing methods like Sindy or KF alone cannot achieve.

Method: SKF integrates Sindy and KF by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, simplifying parameter identification and sparsity estimation.

Result: SKF successfully identifies chaotic Lorenz systems with drifting/switching parameters and a sparse nonlinear aircraft model using real flight data.

Conclusion: SKF bridges Sindy and KF frameworks, enhancing real-time learning capabilities for nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGIMVCM, a novel method for incomplete multi-view clustering using dynamic deep graph learning and masked graph reconstruction loss to address noise and robustness issues in existing GNNs-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data often incomplete, and existing GNNs-based IMVC methods suffer from noise in graph construction and optimization, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: DGIMVCM constructs a missing-robust global graph, uses graph convolutional embedding for feature extraction, employs graph contrastive learning, and integrates a masked graph reconstruction loss for optimization.

Result: Experiments show DGIMVCM outperforms existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness and superiority in handling incomplete multi-view data.

Conclusion: DGIMVCM addresses key challenges in IMVC, offering a robust and efficient solution for clustering incomplete multi-view data.

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

*Tianlang He,Zhongming Lin,Tianrui Jiang,S. -H. Gary Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRaCompass is a reinforcement learning model proposed to efficiently locate LoRa tags in unknown environments using RSSI, addressing vulnerabilities like domain shift and signal fluctuation. It achieves high success rates (>90%) and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of locating LoRa tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) efficiently in unknown environments, where existing methods suffer from domain shift and signal fluctuation issues.

Method: LoRaCompass uses a spatially-aware feature extractor and policy distillation loss for robust spatial representation. It incorporates an exploration function inspired by UCB to guide the sensor toward the tag confidently.

Result: Validated in diverse environments (>80km²), LoRaCompass achieves >90% success rate within 100m proximity (40% improvement) and linear scaling of search path length with initial distance.

Conclusion: LoRaCompass demonstrates robustness and efficiency in locating LoRa tags, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot synthetic validation framework using generative AI to optimize federated learning by stopping training early when optimal performance is reached, saving computational resources without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL methods run for fixed rounds, leading to inefficiencies like unnecessary computation or prolonged training despite poor performance.

Method: Introduces a zero-shot synthetic validation framework leveraging generative AI to monitor performance and decide early stopping points adaptively.

Result: Tests on multi-label chest X-ray classification show up to 74% reduction in training rounds while keeping accuracy within 1% of optimal.

Conclusion: The framework effectively conserves resources and enables quicker hyperparameter tuning by stopping training near the optimal round.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

TL;DR: Sparse convolutional networks, particularly sparse ResNet architectures, are effective for representation learning in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), showing promise across diverse nuclear physics experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the analysis of TPC data by leveraging sparse convolutional networks for better representation learning, applicable across different TPC experiments.

Method: Using sparse ResNet architectures to process raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, pre-training on a binary classification task, and testing embeddings on GADGET II and AT-TPC detectors.

Result: Untrained sparse ResNet models provide useful embeddings; pre-training on GADGET data improves embedding quality for AT-TPC data.

Conclusion: Sparse convolutional techniques are versatile and effective tools for representation learning in various TPC experiments.

Abstract: Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are versatile detectors that reconstruct charged-particle tracks in an ionizing medium, enabling sensitive measurements across a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $β$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data. Together, these results highlight the potential of sparse convolutional techniques as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments.

Result: CNNs achieved ~89% authentication accuracy; autoencoders reached ~75%. The shallow CNN was more efficient.

Conclusion: Finger-drawn digit authentication is viable and can enhance mobile security when combined with existing methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates neural network-based biometric authentication using finger-drawn digits on touchscreen devices. We evaluated CNN and autoencoder architectures for user authentication through simple digit patterns (0-9) traced with finger input. Twenty participants contributed 2,000 finger-drawn digits each on personal touchscreen devices. We compared two CNN architectures: a modified Inception-V1 network and a lightweight shallow CNN for mobile environments. Additionally, we examined Convolutional and Fully Connected autoencoders for anomaly detection. Both CNN architectures achieved ~89% authentication accuracy, with the shallow CNN requiring fewer parameters. Autoencoder approaches achieved ~75% accuracy. The results demonstrate that finger-drawn symbol authentication provides a viable, secure, and user-friendly biometric solution for touchscreen devices. This approach can be integrated with existing pattern-based authentication methods to create multi-layered security systems for mobile applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve the benefits of wider representations without the quadratic cost of increasing hidden size, improving efficiency in large-model training.

Method: VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant.

Result: An 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction, with loss reduction scaling log-linearly with virtual width.

Conclusion: VWN is token-efficient and increasingly effective with scale, suggesting virtual-width scaling as a new dimension for large-model efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.

TL;DR: HealSplit is a novel defense framework for Split Federated Learning (SFL) that detects and recovers from five sophisticated poisoning attacks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for SFL are ineffective due to limited access to complete model updates, leaving vulnerabilities to poisoning attacks targeting various data and model components.

Method: HealSplit includes a topology-aware detection module, a generative recovery pipeline, and an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework to detect and counteract attacks.

Result: HealSplit outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses across four benchmark datasets, showing superior robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: HealSplit provides a robust and effective unified defense solution tailored for SFL, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

*Hong Huang,Chengyu Yao,Haiming Chen,Hang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NASK is a novel graph kernel for attributed graph learning, combining Gower similarity and Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph kernels struggle with heterogeneous attributes and neighborhood info in attributed graphs.

Method: NASK uses Gower similarity for attributes and star substructures with Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations for neighborhood info.

Result: NASK outperforms 16 baselines on 15 real-world graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: NASK is effective for attributed graph learning, with proven positive definiteness and superior performance.

Abstract: Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers, showing EHR models outperform traditional methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cancer screening guidelines are limited in scope and rely on narrow criteria. EHRs capture comprehensive patient data, offering potential for better risk identification.

Method: The study used data from the All of Us Research Program, comparing EHR-based models (including a foundation model) with traditional risk factors like gene mutations and family history.

Result: EHR-based models achieved 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases compared to traditional risk factors. The foundation model further improved performance across 26 cancer types.

Conclusion: EHR-based predictive modeling holds significant clinical potential for more precise and scalable early cancer detection, outperforming current risk factor-based approaches.

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTP methods speed up generation in LLMs but often assume independence between future tokens, sacrificing expressiveness. This work aims to balance expressiveness and latency using PCs.

Method: Proposes MTPC, a framework leveraging probabilistic circuits to encode joint distributions over future tokens. It generalizes classical models and retrofits existing byte-level LLMs.

Result: MTPC, combined with speculative decoding, speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions while maintaining original LLM performance.

Conclusion: MTPC effectively explores trade-offs between expressiveness and latency, optimizing parameterizations like PC architectures and partial layer sharing.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a prominent strategy to significantly speed up generation in large language models (LLMs), including byte-level LLMs, which are tokeniser-free but prohibitively slow. However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM. We also rigorously study the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and latency when exploring the possible parameterisations of MTPC, such as PC architectures and partial layer sharing between the verifier and draft LLMs.

Motivation: Existing MLFFs for cathode materials are limited due to complex electronic structures and scarce high-quality datasets.

Method: Developed a multi-fidelity MLFF framework combining low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic datasets.

Result: Tests on LMFP cathode material showed the framework's effectiveness in achieving high-accuracy training with lower dataset costs.

Conclusion: This approach enhances MLFF training efficiency for cathode materials and opens new avenues for their computational simulation.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeZO enables larger models on edge devices by eliminating activation storage, trading off longer fine-tuning time for memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge AI systems need adaptable models under memory constraints, but BP-based training is memory-intensive.

Method: MeZO uses zeroth-order optimization, avoiding activation storage for gradient estimation.

Result: MeZO allows larger models in memory-constrained devices with comparable accuracy given sufficient time.

Conclusion: MeZO is a viable memory-efficient alternative to BP for edge AI fine-tuning.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectrally normalized surrogate method for mechanical homogenization ensures physical guarantees, achieving high accuracy and generalization in forward and inverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with guaranteed physical bounds, addressing challenges like isotropy fidelity and anisotropy identification.

Method: Uses a Cholesky-like operator to factor Voigt-Reuss bounds, learns a dimensionless representation, and combines spectral normalization with differentiable rendering and CNNs for accurate predictions.

Result: Achieves near-perfect fidelity ($R^2 \!\ge\! 0.998$) for isotropy, median tensor errors of ~1.7%, and robust generalization in 2D and 3D settings.

Conclusion: The Voigt-Reuss net provides accurate, physically admissible predictions and inverse design, applicable to elliptic operators and coupled-physics problems.

Abstract: We propose a spectrally normalized surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees. Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the Löwner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.

Motivation: Phase-time arrays with PSs and TTDs offer cost-effective rainbow beams for wideband sensing and localization, but existing methods lack efficiency.

Method: Trainable PS and TTD coefficients optimize rainbow beams for localization. A lightweight module estimates user positions from feedback after a single downlink transmission.

Result: The method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and achieves consistently lower 2D positioning error compared to existing schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end deep learning approach significantly enhances localization accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of achieving adaptive spacecraft control policies that generalize across distinct mission phases (e.g., launch, ascent, separation), which traditionally require separate policies, limiting adaptability and increasing complexity. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been promising but lack unification across phases.

Method: The method involves a transformer-based RL framework built on PPO, replacing recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure. It integrates GTrXL to maintain coherent memory across long mission phases and eliminates manual transitions. Validation includes benchmarks (double integrator, Van der Pol oscillator), multiphase navigation variants, and a complex rocket ascent problem.

Result: Results show the framework matches analytical solutions in simple cases and learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes. It reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols, proving effective scalable autonomous mission planning.

Conclusion: The transformer-based RL framework successfully unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization, demonstrating near-optimal performance and coherence across diverse mission phases. It establishes a foundation for scalable autonomous control, reducing operational complexity and enhancing adaptability.

Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing matchings in weighted graphs using predicted stochastic weights, proposing multicalibration to address imperfect predictors, ensuring competitive performance with optimal rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between theoretical optimality (using Bayes optimal predictors) and practical scenarios with imperfect predictors, aiming to improve decision-making robustness.

Method: Introduces multicalibration, requiring predictors to be unbiased on protected context sets, and constructs a multicalibrated predictor to compete with optimal rules.

Result: Demonstrates that using the multicalibrated predictor yields competitive performance compared to optimal rules applied to original predictors, with provided sample complexity bounds.

Conclusion: Multicalibration effectively compensates for predictor imperfections, offering a practical solution for robust matching decisions in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems is presented, focusing on admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping, leveraging modern AD tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to simplify and enhance the efficiency of solving acoustic inverse problems by leveraging automatic differentiation and modern software stacks.

Method: The approach uses JAX-FEM's AD for gradient-based admittance estimation and combines JAX-FEM with PyTorch3D for shape optimization, employing randomized finite differences.

Result: The method achieves 3-digit precision in admittance estimation and a 48.1% energy reduction in shape optimization with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions.

Conclusion: Differentiable programming enables rapid prototyping and efficient optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, showcasing the versatility of modern AD tools.

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the practical deployment challenges of FM generative models caused by high-precision parameter requirements.

Method: Apply OT-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and compare it with uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes.

Result: OT-based quantization preserves visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where other methods fail.

Conclusion: OT-based quantization is a principled and effective method for compressing FM generative models, suitable for edge and embedded AI applications.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

TL;DR: RETROFIT is a continual learning method that avoids data replay, using parameter-level merging and low-rank updates to mitigate forgetting and maintain adaptability in security analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models degrade over time due to evolving threats and data shifts, but existing continual learning methods rely on impractical retraining or data replay.

Method: RETROFIT consolidates old and new knowledge via parameter-level merging without historical data, using low-rank/sparse updates and knowledge arbitration.

Result: RETROFIT improves retention scores (e.g., 20.2% to 38.6% in malware detection) and achieves superior BLEU scores in binary summarization compared to baselines.

Conclusion: RETROFIT effectively balances knowledge transfer and adaptability, outperforming existing methods in security-critical continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from high computational costs due to numerous denoising steps and matrix operations. DiffPro addresses this by improving efficiency without retraining.

Method: DiffPro uses a manifold-aware sensitivity metric for weight bit allocation, dynamic activation quantization for stability, and a teacher-student drift-guided timestep selector.

Result: Achieves 6.25x compression, 50% fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with minimal quality loss (Delta FID <= 10).

Conclusion: DiffPro efficiently unifies step reduction and precision planning, enabling real-time, energy-aware deployment of diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in AI regression tasks, proposing a FairReweighing algorithm to ensure fairness across various sensitive attributes, outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in AI regression tasks is underexplored compared to binary classification, raising concerns about transparency and fairness across racial, gender, or age groups.

Method: The authors propose a mutual information-based metric for assessing fairness violations and develop a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm, inspired by fair classification, to ensure separation fairness via density estimation.

Result: Theoretically, FairReweighing guarantees separation under data independence. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fairness and accuracy on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: FairReweighing advances fairness in regression tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in balancing fairness and accuracy.

Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

### [242] [Epistemic Error Decomposition for Multi-step Time Series Forecasting: Rethinking Bias-Variance in Recursive and Direct Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11461)
*Riku Green,Huw Day,Zahraa S. Abdallah,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits the traditional belief that recursive forecasting has high bias and low variance, while direct forecasting has low bias and high variance. It decomposes forecast error into noise, structural approximation gap, and estimation variance, showing these depend on model nonlinearity and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional bias-variance trade-off intuition for recursive vs. direct forecasting strategies and provide a clearer theoretical understanding.

Method: Decompose multi-step forecast error mathematically for linear and nonlinear predictors, analyze structural gaps and estimation variance, and validate with experiments on the ETTm1 dataset using multilayer perceptrons.

Result: For linear predictors, structural gaps are zero; nonlinear predictors' gaps depend on model and data. Recursive forecasting can have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies should consider model nonlinearity and noise, not just traditional bias-variance intuition.

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based model synthesizes radar spectrograms from MoCap data, achieving plausible results and generalizability with lower computation than physics-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage abundant MoCap data for training radar applications and reduce computational costs compared to physics-based approaches.

Method: Formulates MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer to capture spatial and temporal dynamics.

Result: Produces visually and quantitatively plausible radar spectrograms, demonstrating generalizability and understanding of spatial relations.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for time-series signal processing, applicable to IoT radars, and can augment radar datasets using MoCap data.

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes improved methods for evaluating and enhancing adaptiveness in conformal prediction, introducing balanced binning and new metrics, and validating with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for adaptiveness suffer from imbalanced binning, leading to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size.

Method: The authors introduce a binning method using input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. They propose two new metrics for adaptiveness and a new adaptive prediction set algorithm.

Result: Experiments show the proposed metrics correlate better with adaptiveness and the new algorithm outperforms existing methods in ImageNet and medical tasks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates improvements in evaluating and achieving adaptiveness in conformal prediction, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding carbide precipitates in steel is critical for predicting mechanical properties, but traditional thresholding methods fail due to gray-value overlap in SEM images.

Method: The proposed method uses a lightweight U-Net (30.7M parameters) trained on only 10 annotated SEM images for efficient segmentation.

Result: The model achieves a Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98, surpassing traditional metallurgy methods (0.85) and reducing annotation effort significantly.

Conclusion: This data-efficient deep learning approach enables rapid carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, showcasing its potential in metallurgy.

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

TL;DR: The paper estimates the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the RGZ dataset using a diffusion model, finding higher iD for out-of-distribution sources and comparing iD across morphological classes and SNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the intrinsic dimensionality of the RGZ dataset and explore its relationship with energy scores, morphological classes, and SNR.

Method: Used a score-based diffusion model and Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores to estimate iD.

Result: Out-of-distribution sources had higher iD; no relationship between FR classes, but a weak trend for higher SNR at lower iD.

Conclusion: Future work can leverage iD-energy score relationships to enhance self-supervised learning representations in the RGZ dataset.

Abstract: In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blocking communication hinders efficient distributed execution of Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs).

Method: Modifies architecture with skip connections, converts models via self-distillation, and optimizes implementations for overlapping communication and computation.

Result: Achieves accuracy within 1% of original models (e.g., Llama 4 Scout) and accelerates training/inference.

Conclusion: FarSkip-Collective successfully balances architectural modifications with retained model performance and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper generalizes closest fair clustering to multiple groups, showing NP-hardness and proposing efficient approximation algorithms. It also advances fair correlation and consensus clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods often fail to represent marginalized communities fairly, especially with multiple protected attributes. The work addresses this gap.

Method: The study extends closest fair clustering to arbitrary groups, proves NP-hardness, and develops near-linear time approximation algorithms.

Result: Efficient algorithms handle multiple groups, improving fairness guarantees for correlation and consensus clustering.

Conclusion: The work generalizes fair clustering, resolving open questions and enhancing fairness in multi-group settings.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the connection between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and dynamical systems, specifically a multiagent Oja flow, and to classify and analyze the equilibria in such systems.

Method: The study models self-attention dynamics as a continuous-time multiagent system, relates it to the Oja flow, and classifies equilibria into four distinct classes. The stability and alignment with eigenvectors of the value matrix are analyzed.

Result: Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria coexist, often aligning with the eigenvectors of the value matrix. Consensus and bipartite consensus equilibria are always eigenvector-aligned, frequently with the principal eigenvector.

Conclusion: The self-attention dynamics in transformers can be understood through dynamical systems theory, revealing rich equilibria structures with implications for transformer behavior and optimization.

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

TL;DR: Comparison of two communication strategies (S2S and S2A) in semi-decentralized federated learning, analyzing their performance based on data heterogeneity and system parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously compare sampled-to-sampled (S2S) and sampled-to-all (S2A) communication strategies in semi-decentralized federated learning, as their theoretical and empirical differences are underexplored.

Method: Developed a unified convergence framework to analyze S2S and S2A, considering sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Conducted analytical and experimental evaluations.

Result: Identified distinct performance regimes for S2S and S2A, with data heterogeneity being a key factor. Provided evidence-based guidelines for strategy selection.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable insights for optimizing communication strategies in semi-decentralized federated learning, tailored to data heterogeneity and system parameters.

Abstract: In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.

TL;DR: MoBA (Mixture of Block Attention) reduces computational costs in LLMs by sparse attention to key-value blocks, but lacks understanding and efficient GPU implementation. This paper addresses these issues with a statistical model, theoretical improvements (smaller blocks, key convolution), and FlashMoBA for GPU efficiency, achieving competitive performance and speedups.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand MoBA's design principles and improve its GPU implementation, which are currently underdeveloped, hindering practical adoption.

Method: Develops a statistical model to analyze MoBA, identifies improvements (smaller blocks, key convolution), and introduces FlashMoBA, a GPU-efficient CUDA kernel.

Result: FlashMoBA achieves a 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, and improved MoBA models match dense attention performance.

Conclusion: Theoretical insights and hardware-aware implementation (FlashMoBA) make MoBA practical, bridging the gap between theory and GPU efficiency.

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

### [252] [The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10704)
*Samih Fadli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Second Law of Thermodynamics analogy for unconstrained AI, where ethical entropy (divergence from goals) increases without alignment work. It derives a stability boundary for alignment, validated by simulations, suggesting AI alignment requires continuous control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of maintaining AI alignment with intended goals, framing it as a thermodynamic problem to quantify and manage ethical entropy.

Method: The method involves defining ethical entropy mathematically for gradient-based optimizers, proving its increase over time, and deriving a critical stability boundary for alignment work. Simulations validate the theory using large-scale models.

Result: Results show unaligned AI drifts significantly in ethical entropy (0.32 to 1.69 nats), while aligned AI (gamma = 20.4) remains stable (0.00 nats). The stability boundary gamma_crit is quantified.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AI alignment resembles thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative framework to ensure stability and safety in autonomous systems.

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

*Yuan Zhao,Hualei Zhu,Tingyu Jiang,Shen Li,Xiaohang Xu,Hao Henry Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-EPG is a self-iterative framework co-evolving planning and grounding tasks in GUI automation, outperforming existing methods without external data after three iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current GUI agent methodologies: insufficient cross-model synergies and over-reliance on synthetic data.

Method: Proposes Co-EPG, a self-iterative loop using GRPO for planning and grounding model optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl after three iterations.

Conclusion: Introduces a self-driven co-evolution paradigm for GUI agents, enabling continuous improvement.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

### [254] [Multi-agent Undercover Gaming: Hallucination Removal via Counterfactual Test for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11182)
*Dayong Liang,Xiao-Yong Wei,Changmeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol to address hallucinations in LLMs by detecting unreliable agents through counterfactual tests and dynamic evidence modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations hinder LLM reasoning; MAD assumes rational agents, which may not hold due to hallucinations.

Method: MUG reframes MAD as detecting hallucinating agents via counterfactual tests using modified images and multimodal reasoning.

Result: MUG enables factual verification, dynamic evidence reasoning, and active probing, improving multimodal reasoning reliability.

Conclusion: MUG offers a robust framework for detecting hallucinations and enhancing multimodal reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

*Niclas Boehmer,Maximilian T. Wittmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Summarizing multi-objective optimization via Pareto pruning, highlighting axiomatic analysis, a new measure (directed coverage), computational complexity insights, and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ease decision-making by reducing the cognitive load via selecting representative Pareto optimal solutions, addressing limitations of existing quality measures.

Method: Reframes Pareto pruning as multiwinner voting, conducts axiomatic analysis, introduces directed coverage, and analyzes computational complexity.

Result: Reveals unintuitive behaviors in existing measures, identifies tractability boundaries, and shows directed coverage's competitive performance.

Conclusion: The choice of quality measure significantly impacts solution selection, with directed coverage offering robust performance across varied settings.

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

*Yasir Mahmood,Markus Hecher,Johanna Groven,Johannes K. Fichte*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving graph problems with small clique-width, focusing on abstract argumentation. It introduces novel reductions preserving clique-width, achieving efficient results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding encoding capabilities with clique-width, especially for dense graphs, is limited. Abstract argumentation provides a robust framework to study these computational properties.

Method: Designs novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT, linearly preserving clique-width (directed decomposition-guided reductions).

Result: Establishes efficient results for all argumentation semantics, including counting, with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions, showcasing their efficiency and limitations.

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

### [257] [Potential Outcome Rankings for Counterfactual Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10776)
*Yuta Kawakami,Jin Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new metrics (PoR and PoB) for counterfactual decision-making under uncertainty, provides theoretical foundations and estimation methods, and validates them through experiments and real-world application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance counterfactual decision-making by introducing metrics that rank potential outcomes and identify actions likely to yield the best outcome for an individual.

Method: Establishes identification theorems, derives bounds for PoR and PoB, presents estimation methods, and validates with numerical experiments and real-world data.

Result: Theoretical bounds and estimators for PoR and PoB are developed, with finite-sample properties verified through experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics and methods improve decision-making under uncertainty by quantifying and ranking potential outcomes effectively.

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

### [258] [From Efficiency to Adaptivity: A Deeper Look at Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10788)
*Chao Wu,Baoheng Li,Mingchen Gao,Zhenyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reframes reasoning in LLMs through adaptivity, proposing a taxonomy for adaptive reasoning methods and identifying open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack adaptive reasoning strategies, applying uniform methods regardless of task complexity, which hinders efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: The work formalizes classical reasoning paradigms in LLMs, frames adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy problem, and categorizes methods into training-based and training-free approaches.

Result: A systematic taxonomy organizes adaptive reasoning methods, enabling comparison and highlighting gaps.

Conclusion: Open challenges include self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

*Jugal Gajjar,Kaustik Ranaware,Kamalasankari Subramaniakuppusamy,Vaibhav Gandhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperComplEx is a hybrid embedding framework combining hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces for scalable knowledge graph embedding, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with adaptive geometry selection and efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding methods fail to effectively model diverse relationship types in knowledge graphs due to geometric limitations, prompting the need for a hybrid solution.

Method: HyperComplEx combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces using learned attention mechanisms and a relation-specific space weighting strategy, ensuring coherence with a multi-space consistency loss.

Result: HyperComplEx achieves consistent improvements over baselines, with a 0.612 MRR on a 10M-paper dataset (4.8% gain) and efficient 85 ms inference per triple.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses geometric limitations in knowledge graph embeddings, offering scalable, high-performance solutions with reproducible implementation.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An AI framework outperforms human experts in reconstructing traffic collisions, achieving perfect accuracy in complex cases with incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human-based traffic collision reconstruction often yields inconsistent results due to incomplete multimodal data.

Method: A multi-agent AI framework with two phases—reconstruction and reasoning—processes multimodal data (textual reports, tabular data, visual diagrams, and EDR records).

Result: The framework achieved perfect accuracy in 39 complex crash cases, surpassing human accuracy of 92%. It handled incomplete data robustly.

Conclusion: The study highlights AI's superior ability to reconstruct crash scenarios and infer vehicle behaviors with precision, even with fragmented data.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered planning support system to create flexible, demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, combining computational methods with user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional urban planning units often fail to meet local community needs or adapt to hazards, necessitating more dynamic and responsive solutions.

Method: The system uses a RepSC-SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and AI agents to guide region creation, integrating human-in-the-loop for transparency.

Result: Demonstrated via a flooding risk case study in Jacksonville, the platform enables interactive exploration and evaluation of regionalization.

Conclusion: The system successfully merges computational rigor with user-driven adaptability, enhancing disaster planning strategies.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

*Tiantian He,An Zhao,Elinor Thompson,Anna Schroder,Ahmed Abdulaal,Frederik Barkhof,Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using LLMs enhances learning of neurodegenerative disease progression by optimizing disease trajectories and biologically-constrained brain region interactions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods oversimplify brain connectivity or face identifiability issues when learning disease progression patterns. This hinders accurate pathology spread predictions, especially in long-term neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Method: The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides to synthesize multi-modal relationships and constrain graph structures. It learns disease trajectories and brain region interactions from irregular longitudinal patient data.

Result: Applied to tau-PET imaging data in Alzheimer's disease, the framework shows superior prediction accuracy and interpretability, uncovering additional disease-driving factors beyond traditional connectivity measures.

Conclusion: The LLM-enhanced approach improves modeling of neurodegenerative disease progression by integrating biological constraints and multi-modal insights, offering better accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stringent privacy regulations necessitate reliable and scalable automated compliance verification.

Method: Decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents (statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, risk assessment) coordinated via a structured synthesis protocol.

Result: Achieves 72% accuracy (21% higher than baseline), 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases, and perfect detection of violations.

Conclusion: Domain specialization and coordinated reasoning enhance legal AI performance, offering a scalable framework for trustworthy compliance verification.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

TL;DR: Autonomous AI systems must evaluate and justify actions in novel contexts, going beyond trained policies to align with human expectations. This paper outlines decision-making requirements and necessary knowledge types for robust, aligned decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring AI systems make decisions that align with human expectations and values when faced with novel or underspecified scenarios, despite training limitations.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis with empirical case studies to explore how agents integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational knowledge for decision-making.

Result: The paper identifies key requirements and knowledge types for AI agents to construct, evaluate, and justify actions robustly and aligned with human expectations.

Conclusion: Effective agent decision-making in complex environments requires integrating diverse knowledge types beyond trained policies to ensure alignment with human values and goals.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

### [266] [Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11029)
*Özgür Akgün,Mun See Chang,Ian P. Gent,Christopher Jefferson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new method for breaking symmetries in abstract structures within constraint programming, leveraging better representations for improved efficiency compared to prior techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry-breaking techniques in constraint programming often produce complex constraints when applied to abstract variables, leading to poor performance. This paper aims to address this issue.

Method: The paper introduces an incomplete method for breaking symmetries of abstract structures by exploiting their representations more effectively, focusing on indistinguishable objects.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates faster performance compared to previous approaches, as shown in testing against methods from Akgün et al. (2025).

Conclusion: The new symmetry-breaking method improves efficiency for abstract structures, offering practical benefits for constraint programming.

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

TL;DR: The paper explores role allocation strategies in Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) for LLM agents, introducing 'Truth Last' and MADC strategies to enhance reasoning performance by up to 22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored role allocation strategies in MAD and improve reasoning performance in LLM agents.

Method: Proposes 'Truth Last' role allocation and Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, simulating truth through path consistency and optimizing agreement among roles.

Result: MADC improved MAD performance by up to 22% across 9 LLM models, including DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, overcoming performance bottlenecks.

Conclusion: MADC provides a scalable and effective solution for enhancing reasoning in LLM agents through optimized role allocation.

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

*Asen Nachkov,Jan-Nico Zaech,Danda Pani Paudel,Xi Wang,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSS combines differentiable simulation (Waymax) with gradient-based planning to improve autonomous driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning safe actions in complex traffic requires accurate predictions and effective search methods.

Method: Uses Waymax as a differentiable simulator for state prediction and critic, optimizing actions via gradient descent over future trajectories.

Result: DSS outperforms benchmarks like imitation learning and model-free RL in tracking and path planning.

Conclusion: DSS enhances autonomous driving planning by leveraging differentiable simulation and stochastic search.

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARCTraj introduces a dataset and framework for modeling human reasoning in visual tasks, capturing intermediate steps missed by static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of static input-output supervision in understanding human reasoning processes over time.

Method: Records temporally ordered, object-level actions via O2ARC, defining a reasoning pipeline with MDP formulation for integration with various learning methods.

Result: Contains 10,000 trajectories across 400 tasks, revealing diverse human reasoning patterns like spatial selection and color attribution.

Conclusion: ARCTraj provides a structured, interpretable foundation for advancing explainable and generalizable AI.

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

*Dillon Z. Chen,Till Hofmann,Toryn Q. Klassen,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple method for generalised planning (GP) by computing optimal plans, performing goal regression, and lifting outputs to create first-order rules. These rules form a generalised plan usable for execution or search space pruning. The method proves effective in synthesis cost, coverage, and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the synthesis of programs that solve families of related planning problems, addressing limitations in current generalised planning methods.

Method: The method involves computing optimal plans for each goal atom in training problems, performing goal regression, and lifting outputs to derive first-order rules (`Condition → Actions`). These rules form a generalised plan.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art planners in synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality across classical and numeric domains.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently synthesizes valid generalised plans and pruning axioms, outperforming existing GP approaches in key metrics.

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

TL;DR: GGBench is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate geometric generative reasoning in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), addressing gaps in current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning in UMMs, which combines language comprehension and visual generation.

Method: The paper proposes geometric construction as an ideal testbed and introduces GGBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to understand, reason, and construct solutions.

Result: GGBench provides a framework for systematically diagnosing generative reasoning capabilities, setting higher standards for future intelligent systems.

Conclusion: GGBench bridges a critical gap in evaluating UMMs by focusing on generative reasoning, advancing the development of more capable AI systems.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR is a framework enhancing LLMs for table reasoning by incorporating slow-thinking capabilities, iterative refinement, and uncertainty-aware inference, outperforming benchmarks with improved stability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in current LLM-based table reasoning, which lacks depth, iterative refinement, and stability, STaR aims to mimic human cognition and improve reliability.

Method: STaR uses two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL) for training and integrates token-level confidence and answer consistency for uncertainty-aware inference during reasoning.

Result: STaR achieves superior performance and reasoning stability on benchmarks, with strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: STaR presents a reliable, cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs, demonstrating enhanced performance and robustness.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Method: AIonopedia uses an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model and a hierarchical search architecture for IL property prediction and molecular design.

Result: The model delivers superior performance on curated datasets and literature-reported systems, demonstrating effective IL modification and generalization in wet-lab tests.

Conclusion: AIonopedia accelerates real-world IL discovery with its accurate predictions and robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of traceability in AI decision-making by proposing a tamper-proof, verifiable workflow for documenting every component involved in training or inference, demonstrated through a mushroom classification app.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stake AI decisions often lack proper documentation, risking harm and legal accountability issues.

Method: Introduces a workflow leveraging confidential computing to ensure exhaustive, tamper-proof documentation of AI decision components.

Result: First running workflow for traceable AI decisions, demonstrated via a mushroom classification example.

Conclusion: The approach enhances accountability and traceability in AI systems, crucial for legal and ethical compliance.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Contrastive ABox explanations address 'why a is an instance of C but b is not' by analyzing both positive and missing entailments together, focusing on relevant differences. The paper develops this notion for description logic ontologies, analyzes computational complexity, and evaluates an implemented method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods explain positive or missing entailments separately, but contrastive explanations combine both to highlight key differences between instances a and b.

Method: Develops contrastive explanations for ABox reasoning in description logic ontologies, analyzes computational complexity for variants, and implements a method for one variant.

Result: The paper evaluates the implemented method on generated problems from realistic knowledge bases, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Contrastive ABox explanations provide a unified framework to compare instances, offering insights into both entailments and non-entailments.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAlign is an inference-time framework addressing jailbreak vulnerabilities in LVLMs by treating alignment as an economically rational search, balancing safety, utility, and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit reasoning capabilities but suffer from jailbreak vulnerabilities. Current alignment methods struggle with trade-offs between safety, utility, and operational costs.

Method: EcoAlign reframes alignment as an economically rational search, incrementally expanding a thought graph and scoring actions with a forward-looking function that weighs safety, utility, and cost.

Result: EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets.

Conclusion: EcoAlign offers a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment by dynamically balancing safety, utility, and cost.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

TL;DR: RLSLM combines rule-based social models with reinforcement learning to improve social navigation by balancing energy efficiency and human comfort, outperforming existing methods in user experience and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based and data-driven methods for socially-aware navigation have limitations in generalizability, flexibility, efficiency, and alignment with human intuitions. RLSLM aims to bridge this gap by integrating cognitive science principles into machine learning.

Method: RLSLM integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model (grounded in behavioral experiments) into a reinforcement learning framework. It generates a comfort field quantifying human discomfort, optimizing both mechanical energy and social comfort for navigation.

Result: RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience (validated via VR experiments). Ablation studies confirm its improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

Conclusion: RLSLM is a scalable, human-centered approach that effectively combines cognitive science and machine learning for socially-aware navigation, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

TL;DR: MarsRL is a reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent reasoning systems, improving accuracy and efficiency in tasks like AIME2025 and BeyondAIME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in LLMs' reasoning depth and generalize multi-agent systems to open-source models.

Method: Proposes MarsRL with agentic pipeline parallelism, agent-specific rewards, and pipeline-inspired training.

Result: MarsRL boosts accuracy (AIME2025: 86.5% to 93.3%, BeyondAIME: 64.9% to 73.8%) and outperforms larger models.

Conclusion: MarsRL enhances multi-agent reasoning systems, expanding their use across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL approaches often assume ideal communication, which is unrealistic. The paper aims to address practical constraints like latency and bandwidth.

Method: The survey systematically reviews recent advances in MARL communication strategies, focusing on robustness and efficiency under realistic conditions.

Result: Identifies key applications (e.g., autonomous driving) and outlines challenges in communication-learning co-design for practical MARL systems.

Conclusion: Advocates for unified approaches integrating communication, learning, and robustness to align theoretical MARL models with real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing predictive models often overlook interactions and temporal patterns across EHR data modalities, limiting their effectiveness for chronic disease prediction.

Method: CURENet combines unstructured clinical notes (processed by LLMs), lab tests, and time-series visit data (processed by transformer encoders) to capture multimodal interactions.

Result: Achieved over 94% accuracy in predicting top 10 chronic conditions on MIMIC-III and FEMH datasets.

Conclusion: Multimodal EHR integration via CURENet enhances predictive accuracy and supports better clinical decision-making for chronic illnesses.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGuR dynamically generates tailored problem-solving strategies at inference time using LLM-based meta-strategies, achieving significant accuracy improvements and cost reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in enabling AI systems to adapt flexibly post-training without offline optimization. Existing methods lack the ability to modify key components like prompts or tools dynamically.

Method: EGuR uses an LLM-based meta-strategy to generate complete computational procedures (strategies) dynamically, guided by accumulated experience. It consists of a Guide for candidate strategies and a Consolidator for feedback integration.

Result: EGuR improves accuracy by up to 14% and reduces computational costs by up to 111x across five benchmarks, with performance improving over time.

Conclusion: EGuR demonstrates the feasibility of dynamic, experience-guided adaptation in AI systems, offering significant gains in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Motivation: Ensuring AI agents adhere to ethical guidelines in dynamic environments is difficult, especially for pre-trained agents, due to costly retraining and diverse ethical attributes.

Method: The authors propose a model-guided policy shaping technique applied at test time, using scenario-action attribute classifiers to align decisions with ethical attributes without retraining.

Result: Tested on the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, the method effectively mitigates unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes, outperforming prior training-time methods.

Conclusion: Test-time policy shaping offers a scalable and effective solution for aligning AI agents with ethical guidelines while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper presents assume-guarantee verification schemes for probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information, proving their soundness and discussing completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model checking strategic abilities is challenging, especially for imperfect information agents in stochastic environments. Assume-guarantee reasoning helps decompose complex problems into simpler subproblems.

Method: Several assume-guarantee verification schemes are proposed for probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information, along with a new non-probabilistic logic variant.

Result: The schemes' soundness is proven, and completeness is discussed. The new logic variant introduces strategic modalities capturing "achieving at most φ."

Conclusion: The proposed schemes and logic variant enhance model checking of strategic abilities in complex, stochastic environments with imperfect information.

Abstract: Model checking of strategic abilities is a notoriously hard problem, even more so in the realistic case of agents with imperfect information, acting in a stochastic environment. Assume-guarantee reasoning can be of great help here, providing a way to decompose the complex problem into a small set of easier subproblems.
  In this paper, we propose several schemes for assume-guarantee verification of probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information. We prove the soundness of the schemes, and discuss their completeness. On the way, we also propose a new variant of (non-probabilistic) alternating-time logic, where the strategic modalities capture "achieving at most $\varphi$," analogous to Levesque's logic of "only knowing."

TL;DR: A theoretical framework links system-level evaluation in LLM multi-agent systems to agent-level learning using game-theoretic attribution and process reward modeling, ensuring fair credit and cooperative behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods for LLMs in MAS lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level learning.

Method: Proposes a framework combining cooperative game-theoretic attribution (e.g., Shapley) with process reward modeling to convert system evaluation into agent credit and response-level signals.

Result: Produces bounded, cooperative signals compatible with reinforcement or preference-based post-training, promoting fair credit assignment and discouraging harmful behavior.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified pathway from global evaluation to local supervision, with empirical validation left for future work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.

TL;DR: SafeAgents is a unified framework for assessing security vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems (MAS), highlighting design flaws and introducing Dharma for diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks comprehensive security evaluation for MAS, leaving vulnerabilities unchecked.

Method: SafeAgents evaluates design choices like plan construction and inter-agent sharing, using Dharma to diagnose weaknesses.

Result: Centralized systems are less robust due to obscured harmful objectives, revealing security risks in common designs.

Conclusion: Security-aware design is crucial for MAS, as demonstrated by SafeAgents' findings.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.
