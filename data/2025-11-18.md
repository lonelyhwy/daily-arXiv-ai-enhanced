Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with evidence localization in long visual documents, leading to poor performance and hallucination. DocLens aims to address this by enhancing retrieval and focus on fine-grained details.

Method: DocLens uses a multi-agent framework to navigate documents, zoom in on relevant visual elements, and employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism for reliable answers. It's paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Result: DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, excelling particularly on vision-centric and unanswerable queries.

Conclusion: DocLens demonstrates superior evidence localization capabilities, offering a robust solution for comprehending long visual documents.

Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.
