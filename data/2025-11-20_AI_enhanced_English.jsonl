Conversely, recent large language models (LLMs)-based methods ignore the rich information across students, and both paradigms struggle to deliver consistently accurate and evidence-based explanations. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports.

Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression.

Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity.

To achieve continuous all-day person matching across day and night, Visible-Infrared Lifelong person Re-IDentification (VI-LReID) focuses on sequential training on data from visible and infrared modalities and pursues average performance over all data. To this end, existing methods typically exploit cross-modal knowledge distillation to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. However, these methods ignore the mutual interference of modality-specific knowledge acquisition and modality-common knowledge anti-forgetting, where conflicting knowledge leads to collaborative forgetting. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Cross-modality Knowledge Disentanglement and Alignment method, called CKDA, which explicitly separates and preserves modality-specific knowledge and modality-common knowledge in a balanced way. Specifically, a Modality-Common Prompting (MCP) module and a Modality-Specific Prompting (MSP) module are proposed to explicitly disentangle and purify discriminative information that coexists and is specific to different modalities, avoiding the mutual interference between both knowledge. In addition, a Cross-modal Knowledge Alignment (CKA) module is designed to further align the disentangled new knowledge with the old one in two mutually independent inter- and intra-modality feature spaces based on dual-modality prototypes in a balanced manner.

To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion (DLRRF) model. First, we model the spectral variability as change in the spectral degradation operator.

We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%.

This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140).

Since a single past sequence can lead to multiple possible futures, a probabilistic HMP method predicts such multiple motions. While a single motion predicted by a deterministic method is evaluated only with the difference from its ground truth motion, multiple predicted motions should also be evaluated based on their distribution. For this evaluation, this paper focuses on the following two criteria. \\textbf{(a) Coverage}: motions should be distributed among multiple motion modes to cover diverse possibilities. \\textbf{(b) Validity}: motions should be kinematically valid as future motions observable from a given past motion. However, existing metrics simply appreciate widely distributed motions even if these motions are observed in a single mode and kinematically invalid. To resolve these disadvantages, this paper proposes a Multimodality-aware Metric using Clustering-based Modes (MMCM). For (a) coverage, MMCM divides a motion space into several clusters, each of which is regarded as a mode. These modes are used to explicitly evaluate whether predicted motions are distributed among multiple modes.

While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments confirm that our method surpasses threshold-based baselines in two-class classification by an average of 2.7% AUROC, while retaining or improving open-set mAP.

To resolve this paradox, we introduce a token-level Spectral Energy Pattern (SEP) analysis that measures how each token uses channel capacity. SEP reveals that, despite the global low-rank structure, individual tokens distribute energy over most channels, forming a high-bandwidth encoding pattern. This results in an encoding mismatch between wide teachers and narrow students.
