Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFit is a universal VTON framework using a Multimodal Large Language Model to bridge semantic gaps and handle complex tasks with limited data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing semantic gaps and data scarcity in existing multi-task VTON frameworks guided by text instructions.

Method: Introduces MGSA for semantic alignment and a two-stage training strategy with self-synthesis to learn from limited data.

Result: UniFit supports diverse VTON tasks and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: UniFit offers a versatile and high-performing solution for VTON challenges.

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [2] [EfficientSAM3: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation for Video Concept Segmentation from SAM1, 2, and 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15833)
*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientSAM3 introduces Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) to create lightweight models from SAM3, enabling on-device concept segmentation with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unified architecture of SAM3 is too resource-intensive for on-device applications, prompting the need for efficient alternatives.

Method: PHD involves three stages: Encoder Distillation, Temporal Memory Distillation, and End-to-End Fine-Tuning, using lightweight backbones like RepViT and TinyViT.

Result: EfficientSAM3 achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs on VOS datasets.

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3 successfully transfers SAM3's capabilities to lightweight models, making on-device concept segmentation feasible.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [3] [WALDO: Where Unseen Model-based 6D Pose Estimation Meets Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15874)
*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in 6D pose estimation for unseen objects under occlusion by proposing four novel extensions to model-based methods, improving accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is crucial for robotics and AR, but existing methods struggle with unseen objects and occlusion errors.

Method: Proposes dynamic sampling, multi-hypothesis inference, iterative refinement, and occlusion-focused training augmentations. Introduces a visibility-weighted evaluation metric.

Result: Achieves >5% accuracy improvement on ICBIN and >2% on BOP benchmarks, with 3x faster inference.

Conclusion: The proposed extensions enhance robustness and generalization in 6D pose estimation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

### [4] [Automatic Uncertainty-Aware Synthetic Data Bootstrapping for Historical Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15875)
*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of training deep learning models for historical map analysis by generating synthetic maps with realistic style and noise, reducing reliance on scarce annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps lack sufficient annotated training data for deep learning, and synthetic data often lacks realism and diversity. The paper aims to bridge this gap by generating high-quality synthetic maps.

Method: The authors propose an automatic deep generative approach and a manual stochastic degradation technique to create synthetic historical maps with realistic noise. These maps are used for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network.

Result: The generated synthetic maps effectively address the scarcity of annotated data and improve domain-adaptive semantic segmentation performance for historical maps.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully bootstrap synthetic training data for historical map analysis, demonstrating their utility in improving deep learning performance for this domain.

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [5] [Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15884)
*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D is a category-level 6D pose estimation method for warehouse storage boxes, balancing accuracy and efficiency by using a binary search for dimensions and a CAD template, achieving faster inference times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing methods (model-based, model-free, and category-level) for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation in cluttered and occluded warehouse environments.

Method: Box6D uses a single RGB-D observation to infer box dimensions via binary search and estimates poses with a category CAD template. It includes a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy to reduce computational cost.

Result: Evaluations show Box6D achieves competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by ~76%.

Conclusion: Box6D is a practical and efficient solution for 6D pose estimation in warehouse settings, overcoming challenges of clutter and occlusion.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

### [6] [RB-FT: Rationale-Bootstrapped Fine-Tuning for Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15923)
*Meilong Xu,Di Fu,Jiaxing Zhang,Gong Yu,Jiayu Zheng,Xiaoling Hu,Dongdi Zhao,Feiyang Li,Chao Chen,Yong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage self-improvement paradigm for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enhance domain-specific video classification by generating and using self-rationales without additional annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with domain-specific video classification due to limited data and a rationale gap, where sparse domain data fails to connect spatio-temporal content with abstract labels.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) VLMs generate textual rationales for videos to articulate domain logic, then fine-tune on these self-generated rationales. (2) Perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on task labels.

Result: The method outperforms direct SFT significantly in diverse datasets, proving self-generated rationales as an annotation-efficient way to adapt VLMs.

Conclusion: Self-generated rationales effectively bridge the rationale gap, enhancing VLM performance in domain-specific video analysis without extra annotations.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

### [7] [Boosting Medical Visual Understanding From Multi-Granular Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15943)
*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGLL proposes a contrastive learning framework to improve multi-label and cross-granularity alignment in image-text pretraining, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's single-label, single-granularity alignment is insufficient for complex domains like medical imaging, where multi-label and diverse granularities are common.

Method: MGLL uses structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and employs smooth KL divergence for cross-granularity consistency.

Result: MGLL demonstrates superior performance in downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MGLL effectively addresses the limitations of CLIP in complex domains, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

### [8] [Automated Interpretable 2D Video Extraction from 3D Echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15946)
*Milos Vukadinovic,Hirotaka Ieki,Yuki Sahasi,David Ouyang,Bryan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated method proposed to extract standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes using deep learning and anatomical heuristics, validated by cardiologists and AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve interpretation of 3D cardiac ultrasound data by converting it into familiar 2D views for clinicians.

Method: Combines deep learning view classifier with anatomical landmark heuristics and cardiologist input to reconstruct standard echocardiography views.

Result: Achieved 96% accuracy in blinded evaluation (1,600 videos). Preserved diagnostic features and spatial calibration in 2D videos.

Conclusion: Extracted 2D views enable accurate clinical interpretation of 3D volumes, with code and dataset released.

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

### [9] [Click2Graph: Interactive Panoptic Video Scene Graphs from a Single Click](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15948)
*Raphael Ruschel,Hardikkumar Prajapati,Awsafur Rahman,B. S. Manjunath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph is an interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that combines visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding, enabling user-guided video scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VSGG systems lack human guidance, while promptable segmentation models like SAM2 miss semantic or relational reasoning. Click2Graph bridges this gap by integrating user interaction with comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: Click2Graph uses a single user cue (e.g., click or bounding box) to segment and track subjects, discover interacting objects, and predict scene graph triplets. It includes a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module for object prompts and a Semantic Classification Head for joint reasoning.

Result: Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark show Click2Graph effectively combines human prompting with panoptic grounding and relational inference, achieving temporally consistent scene graphs.

Conclusion: Click2Graph successfully integrates user interaction with advanced PVSG capabilities, offering a controllable and interpretable approach to video scene understanding.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

### [10] [InfoCLIP: Bridging Vision-Language Pretraining and Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation via Information-Theoretic Alignment Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15967)
*Muyao Yuan,Yuanhong Zhang,Weizhan Zhang,Lan Ma,Yuan Gao,Jiangyong Ying,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoCLIP stabilizes CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary segmentation by using mutual information objectives to preserve alignment knowledge and reduce noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fine-tuning CLIP for segmentation overfit and harm its pretrained vision-language alignment.

Method: InfoCLIP employs mutual information to compress noisy pixel-text alignment and transfer compact local semantic relations.

Result: Extensive benchmarks show InfoCLIP enhances CLIP fine-tuning, proving its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

Conclusion: InfoCLIP effectively transfers CLIP's alignment knowledge to segmentation, improving generalization without degrading pretrained alignment.

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

### [11] [Externally Validated Multi-Task Learning via Consistency Regularization Using Differentiable BI-RADS Features for Breast Ultrasound Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15968)
*Jingru Zhang,Saed Moradi,Ashirbani Saha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consistency regularization method to enhance multi-task learning for breast ultrasound tumor segmentation, improving generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address destructive task interference in multi-task learning, which hampers performance and generalization in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation.

Method: Introduces a consistency regularization approach using BI-RADS-inspired morphological features, validated on multiple external datasets.

Result: Statistically significant improvements in segmentation performance (Dice coefficients: 0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49) and state-of-the-art results on UDIAT.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates interference and enhances segmentation generalization, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

*Xinyu Nan,Lingtao Mao,Huangyu Dai,Zexin Zheng,Xinyu Sun,Zihan Liang,Ben Chen,Yuqing Ding,Chenyi Lei,Wenwu Ou,Han Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a detection-guided generative framework for unified visual semantic understanding, excelling in fine-grained category and attribute recognition in e-commerce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current global similarity-based methods fail to capture fine-grained distinctions and diverse attributes in large-scale e-commerce scenarios.

Method: Uses a BART-based generator with refined ROI-level features to produce hierarchical semantic tokens for categories and attributes.

Result: Outperforms similarity-based and multi-stage systems in fine-grained recognition and unified inference.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves superior visual semantic understanding, especially in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

*Dawei Li,Zijian Gu,Peng Wang,Chuhan Song,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Tianlong Chen,Yu Tian,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS) to improve fairness in multimodal large language models for medical image reasoning without fine-tuning, addressing demographic imbalances in exemplars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness across demographic groups is a concern in medical image reasoning with MLLMs, and existing debiasing methods are impractical for large-scale models.

Method: The authors propose FADS, a clustering-based sampling method to create demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL).

Result: FADS reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining accuracy across multiple medical imaging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware in-context learning, exemplified by FADS, offers a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

### [14] [Exploiting Inter-Sample Information for Long-tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16015)
*Nimeshika Udayangani,Hadi M. Dolatabadi,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using graph-based representation improves OOD detection in long-tailed datasets by refining pre-trained model features with GCNs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods struggle with high false positive rates and low accuracy in tail-class ID data, especially in long-tailed datasets.

Method: Initializes a graph structure from pre-trained model features, applies Gaussianization, and refines it using GCNs for better OOD detection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT benchmarks in FPR and tail-class ID accuracy.

Conclusion: Graph-based representation effectively addresses OOD detection challenges in long-tailed datasets, improving performance metrics significantly.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

### [15] [Physically Realistic Sequence-Level Adversarial Clothing for Robust Human-Detection Evasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16020)
*Dingkun Zhou,Patrick P. K. Chan,Hengxu Wu,Shikang Zheng,Ruiqi Huang,Yuanjie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sequence-level optimization framework generates printable adversarial textures for clothing to evade detection in videos, ensuring robustness across motion and viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for human detection are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing safety risks. Wearable attacks need long-term concealment across dynamic conditions.

Method: The paper maps product images to UV space, uses a compact palette with printable colors, and simulates motion and lighting variations. It optimizes control points to minimize detection confidence.

Result: The approach achieves stable concealment, robustness to viewpoint changes, and cross-model transferability, validated in digital and physical settings.

Conclusion: Printable adversarial textures effectively evade detection in real-world scenarios, confirmed through extensive experiments and physical testing.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution, integrating sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to address limitations in existing dense Real-ISR models. It introduces expert partitioning, degradation estimation, and dynamic load-balancing for improved performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense Real-ISR models lack adaptability to diverse degraded samples and efficient knowledge sharing. The study aims to enhance these aspects using sparse MoE.

Method: Proposes MoR architecture with expert partitioning in LoRA ranks, CLIP-based degradation estimation, zero-expert slots, and degradation-aware load-balancing loss.

Result: The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in real-world image super-resolution.

Conclusion: MoR effectively improves adaptability and computational efficiency in Real-ISR, validated by comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based speckle pattern classification provides a reliable solution for material-aware laser cutting, enhancing safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuriGS introduces a curriculum-guided framework using student views to improve sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction, outperforming baselines in fidelity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to sparse-view settings is challenging due to supervision scarcity and overfitting from limited viewpoint coverage.

Method: CuriGS uses student views (pseudo-views around ground-truth poses) with perturbation levels. Training follows a curriculum schedule, regularizes students, and retains high-quality views.

Result: CuriGS achieves superior rendering fidelity and geometric consistency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively augments sparse training views, addressing sparse-view synthesis challenges.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

TL;DR: A cross-modal learning strategy enhances high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV-level detail for crop canopy trait estimation, improving agricultural monitoring tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of satellite imagery's spatial resolution for micro-plot farming by leveraging UAV-like detail.

Method: Using co-registered satellite-UAV image pairs from maize plots in the U.S. Corn Belt, a model learns spectral-spatial correspondences between modalities.

Result: Generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs outperform real satellite imagery in tasks like yield and nitrogen prediction.

Conclusion: Cross-modal correspondence learning effectively bridges the gap between satellite and UAV sensing for agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Ee-Peng Lim,Qianru Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using LLMs to improve food recognition by generating text descriptions and aligning them with images in a shared space, addressing domain-shift and long-tailed data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food recognition faces challenges like domain-shift and long-tailed distributions, where real-world images differ from training data and some dishes are hard to distinguish visually.

Method: The framework uses LLMs to generate food titles and ingredients from images, aligns text and image features in a shared embedding space, and combines these features for recognition.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods for long-tailed data, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification on two food datasets.

Conclusion: The simple yet effective framework leverages LLMs to enhance food recognition by aligning multimodal features.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMS-KV is a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for VAR models, reducing KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and latency by 60.48%, enabling larger batch sizes without memory failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the excessive KV memory growth bottleneck in next-scale prediction-based VAR transformers, which limits scalability.

Method: Introduces AMS-KV, prioritizing condensed and local scales, optimizing cache layers via similarity analysis.

Result: Reduces KV cache usage by 84.83%, latency by 60.48%, and scales batch size to 256 without failures.

Conclusion: AMS-KV efficiently balances memory and computational demands, enhancing VAR model scalability and performance.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable simulation environments in autonomous driving drives the synthesis of realistic and controllable 4D LiDAR data, overcoming challenges posed by sensor geometry and dynamic scenes.

Method: LiSTAR uses Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical representation to avoid quantization artifacts and Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer for temporal coherence. It also employs Masked Generative START for controllable synthesis.

Result: LiSTAR achieves significant improvements: 76% reduction in MMD, 32% higher IoU in reconstruction, and 50% lower L1 Med in prediction.

Conclusion: LiSTAR sets a new benchmark for 4D LiDAR data synthesis, offering a robust foundation for realistic autonomous systems simulations.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Motivation: Addressing the high computational demands of deep learning models in HSI classification by improving training efficiency.

Method: Integrates curriculum learning with PCA-based spectral downsampling to gradually introduce spectral complexity while preserving essential information.

Result: Achieves 2-7x training speedups with minimal accuracy loss, validated on benchmark datasets including CloudPatch-7.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that optimizing training strategies can complement architectural design for efficient HSI model deployment.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Abstract: We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar.

Result: Achieves top-tier results in nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten others, demonstrating success in cross-task VICL.

Conclusion: The study successfully unlocks cross-task VICL capabilities in VLMs, showcasing promising performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

Result: The method improves temporal consistency and perceptual rendering quality, achieving a 0.39dB PSNR gain on the Technicolor Light Field dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed technique enhances alignment between splats and dynamic objects, demonstrating effective error correction and splat initialization.

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

*Tianxiong Zhong,Xingye Tian,Xuebo Wang,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCS-LDM decouples content complexity from scale in latent diffusion models, enabling flexible generation across resolutions and frame rates with a fixed latent representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models tie scale to content complexity, while latent capacity should primarily depend on complexity, not scale.

Method: DCS-LDM creates a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space using multi-level tokens for content complexity and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions/frame rates.

Result: DCS-LDM matches state-of-the-art performance while allowing flexible scale and quality tradeoffs.

Conclusion: DCS-LDM offers a scalable, flexible generation paradigm by separating complexity and scale in latent diffusion models.

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker addresses blur and misalignment issues in high-resolution video frame interpolation by introducing guided flow upsampling and texture mapping, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution motion estimation is challenging due to pixel movement and computational costs. Existing methods lead to blurry edges and ghosting artifacts.

Method: VTinker uses guided flow upsampling (GFU) to refine low-resolution flows with input frames as guidance, followed by texture mapping to create an intermediate proxy for clear texture selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show VTinker outperforms existing methods in video frame interpolation.

Conclusion: VTinker's combination of GFU and texture mapping effectively reduces artifacts and improves interpolation quality.

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution generalization in detecting AI-generated images is challenged by spurious shortcuts exploited during training.

Method: Proposes PiN-CLIP, which trains a noise generator and detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle, injecting noise to fine-tune visual encoders.

Result: Achieves 5.4% higher average accuracy than existing methods on a dataset with 42 generative models.

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP effectively suppresses shortcuts and enhances forensic cues, leading to robust and generalized artifact detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances blind QECV performance significantly by improving degradation representation and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

*Chenyu Zhao,Xianwei Zheng,Zimin Xia,Linwei Yue,Nan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SR3D introduces a novel framework for 3D object detection in indoor point clouds, addressing the training-inference gap with spatial-prioritized and rank-aware components, achieving superior accuracy and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between training and inference in 3D object detection, due to lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness, hampers model performance.

Method: SR3D uses spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment and rank-aware adaptive self-distillation to align training with inference.

Result: SR3D outperforms prior methods on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap, enhancing accuracy and performance in real-time 3D object detection.

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

### [33] [A Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception Attention for Remote Sensing Water Body Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16143)
*Quanqing Ma,Jiaen Chen,Peng Wang,Yao Zheng,Qingzhan Zhao,Yuchen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new high-resolution dataset (HSRW-CD) for Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) and proposes an attention module (SSCP) to improve spatial semantics and structural feature exploitation in WBCD networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing high spatial resolution datasets are scarce for WBCD, limiting accurate positioning in urban/rural areas. Previous deep learning methods inadequately exploit spatial semantics and structural features in networks.

Method: A new dataset (HSRW-CD) with >3m resolution is introduced. The SSCP attention module includes Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA) to enhance feature discrimination.

Result: Experiments on HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate SSCP's effectiveness and generalization, improving water body detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The SSCP module enhances WBCD by leveraging spatial semantics and structure, and the HSRW-CD dataset addresses the scarcity of high-resolution data.

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

*Caixin Kang,Yifei Huang,Liangyang Ouyang,Mingfang Zhang,Ruicong Liu,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights the inability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to assess deception in social interactions, introduces a new task (MIDA) and dataset for evaluation, and proposes a framework (SoCoT and DSEM) to improve social reasoning in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack human-like abilities to 'read the room' and detect deception in social interactions. This gap underscores the need for more perceptive AI systems.

Method: The authors introduce the MIDA task and a multimodal dataset with ground-truth labels. They evaluate 12 MLLMs, analyze failure modes, and propose SoCoT and DSEM modules for improvement.

Result: Benchmarking shows MLLMs, including GPT-4o, struggle with deception assessment. The proposed framework improves performance, offering a path toward better social reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper identifies critical limitations in MLLMs' social reasoning and proposes a novel framework to enhance their ability to assess deception, advancing toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

TL;DR: LEGO-SLAM integrates language features into 3DGS-based SLAM for real-time, open-vocabulary mapping using a compact scene-adaptive encoder-decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems lack semantic understanding, and integrating language features is challenging due to memory and adaptability issues.

Method: Proposes LEGO-SLAM with a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder, distilling high-dimensional embeddings into a compact 16D space, enabling real-time performance and language-guided pruning.

Result: Reduces memory per Gaussian, accelerates rendering, prunes semantic redundancy by 60%, and achieves competitive mapping quality at 15 FPS.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM successfully integrates language into SLAM for real-time, open-vocabulary mapping with efficient memory use.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

*Chunxu Liu,Jiyuan Yang,Ruopeng Gao,Yuhan Zhu,Feng Zhu,Rui Zhao,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), a method that integrates generative reasoning from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into embedding extraction to improve multimodal representation quality, achieving a 4.9% performance boost in retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat embedding extraction as a simple encoding step, ignoring MLLMs' generative reasoning capability, which could enhance representation quality.

Method: RGE combines generative rationale generation with contrastive training, extracting representations after reasoning unfolds to improve context-conditional inference signals.

Result: Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show a 4.9% improvement in multimodal retrieval performance over non-reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning in embedding extraction effectively enhances multimodal representation quality.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

TL;DR: PPCL is a flexible pruning framework for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) that reduces parameters by 50% with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs incur high computational costs due to large parameters, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Method: PPCL uses layer redundancy identification and a plug-and-play distillation scheme for depth-wise and width-wise pruning.

Result: Achieves 50% parameter reduction with <3% degradation in performance.

Conclusion: PPCL maintains high-quality image generation while enabling efficient deployment in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: Video2Layout improves MLLMs' spatial reasoning by using continuous boundary coordinates for fine-grained layout reconstruction from videos, outperforming grid-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grid-based spatial maps limit fine-grained reasoning; Video2Layout aims to enhance this by leveraging continuous coordinates for better accuracy and quantitative spatial computation.

Method: Video2Layout uses supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning stages to learn precise boundary coordinates from simulated data and improve real-world generalization.

Result: V2LO-7B achieves a 4.92% average improvement over grid-based methods on benchmarks like QVS-Bench.

Conclusion: Video2Layout's approach effectively enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs, validated by benchmark performance.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

TL;DR: TimeViper is a hybrid vision-language model combining Mamba and Transformer architectures for efficient long video understanding, featuring TransV for token compression and maintaining multimodal capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of processing long videos efficiently requires balancing model architecture and handling extended temporal contexts.

Method: Adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone and introduces TransV to transfer and compress vision tokens into instruction tokens.

Result: Successfully processes hour-long videos (~10,000 frames) and matches state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: TimeViper advances hybrid model efficiency and interpretability, opening avenues for further development.

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: Simba improves point cloud completion by replacing direct regression with distribution learning, integrating symmetry priors and diffusion models, and using a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture for better detail and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression-based methods for point cloud completion overfit to instance-specific transformations and are noise-sensitive, limiting their generalizability and robustness.

Method: Simba reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem, combining symmetry priors with diffusion models and employing a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture.

Result: Simba achieves state-of-the-art performance on PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simba addresses key limitations of regression-based methods, offering improved robustness, generalization, and detail preservation in point cloud completion.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurvAgent is a hierarchical CoT-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction, addressing gaps in transparency and multimodal integration compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods lack transparency and fail to integrate multimodal data, explore regions of interest effectively, or leverage experiential learning.

Method: SurvAgent uses a two-stage approach: (1) Case Bank Construction with hierarchical analysis for pathology images and gene-stratified analysis, and (2) Multi-Expert Agent Inference integrating reports via RAG and progressive refinement.

Result: SurvAgent outperforms conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and other medical agents across five TCGA cohorts.

Conclusion: SurvAgent sets a new standard for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LNG-SWR is a robust medical image segmentation method that uses layer-wise noise injection and selective wavelet reconstruction to improve stability under perturbations without sacrificing clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of adversarial training (AT), such as trade-offs between clean and robust performance and high computational costs, in medical image segmentation.

Method: Layers of noise are injected during training to bias representations away from noise-sensitive frequencies. Selective wavelet reconstruction is then applied to adaptively enhance useful features and suppress noise.

Result: LNG-SWR improves clean Dice/IoU scores and reduces performance drops under adversarial attacks, with further gains when combined with AT.

Conclusion: LNG-SWR offers a scalable, backbone-agnostic solution for robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training scenarios.

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

TL;DR: TwiG introduces an interleaved framework ('Thinking-while-Generating') combining textual reasoning dynamically during visual generation, enhancing context-awareness and semantic richness. Three strategies are explored: zero-shot prompting, SFT, and RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack real-time multimodal interaction during visual generation. TwiG aims to integrate textual reasoning dynamically for richer outputs.

Method: TwiG interleaves textual reasoning with visual generation, exploring zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL).

Result: The framework produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs by dynamically guiding and reflecting on generation.

Conclusion: TwiG pioneers interleaved reasoning for visual generation, inspiring future research with its potential for enhanced outputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

TL;DR: Verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) is proposed to optimize adversarial perturbations in images, using a two-stage framework to maximize VLM output tokens, improving efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of stability and controllability in existing methods prolonging VLM outputs, aiming to reduce energy, latency, and token costs.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) adversarial prompt search via reinforcement learning, 2) vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft malicious images.

Result: VTIA outperforms existing methods in effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization across four popular VLMs.

Conclusion: VTIA successfully maximizes output tokens as an explicit objective, offering a stable and controllable solution for verbose-text induction.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: EvoVLA addresses stage hallucination in VLA models with SAR, POE, and Long-Horizon Memory, improving task success and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with stage hallucination, exploiting shortcuts instead of truly completing multi-step tasks.

Method: Introduces SAR (contrastive learning), POE (pose-based exploration), and Long-Horizon Memory (context retention).

Result: EvoVLA improves task success by 10.2 points, reduces stage hallucination, and achieves better sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: EvoVLA outperforms baselines in long-horizon manipulation, demonstrating robust generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

TL;DR: RF-CLIP improves CLIP's dense prediction by addressing attention diversion to irrelevant tokens, inspired by human distraction-refocusing behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing CLIP's pixel-level multimodal alignment for better open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Method: Proposes ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free method filtering irrelevant tokens to refine attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks with high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: RF-CLIP effectively refines CLIP's multimodal alignment, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mantis introduces Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to improve Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by decoupling visual foresight prediction, enhancing comprehension and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in VLA models like high-dimensional visual state prediction costs, information bottlenecks, and poor comprehension due to neglect of language supervision.

Method: Uses meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head to disentangle visual foresight prediction, leveraging residual connections for next-state prediction.

Result: Achieves 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark, outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior instruction-following, generalization, and reasoning.

Conclusion: Mantis effectively reduces VLA backbone burden while improving performance and capabilities, supported by empirical success.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

*Nianchang Huang,Yi Xu,Ruida Xi,Ruida Xi,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method (UDA-VI-ReID) for Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification, addressing modality discrepancies between public and real-world data with a two-stage model (DSLGA) and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between public datasets and real-world applications in VI-ReID by enabling knowledge transfer without new annotations.

Method: A two-stage model (DSLGA) includes Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) for inter-domain discrepancies and Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) for intra-domain discrepancies, followed by CMDA-XD testing method.

Result: DSLGA outperforms existing domain adaptation and some supervised methods in VI-ReID under various settings.

Conclusion: The proposed UDA-VI-ReID framework effectively addresses modality discrepancies and enhances performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning approaches often treat organ substructures independently, leading to anatomically implausible reconstructions. PrIntMesh addresses this by modeling organs as interconnected systems.

Method: PrIntMesh uses a connected template to jointly deform all substructures while preserving internal boundaries and ensuring smooth surfaces. It handles limited or noisy training data robustly.

Conclusion: PrIntMesh provides a clinically suitable, data-efficient solution for organ reconstruction, ensuring anatomical plausibility and structural consistency.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

*Yuping Yan,Yuhan Xie,Yinxin Zhang,Lingjuan Lyu,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Fool explores adversarial robustness in Vision-Language-Action models, introducing multimodal attacks and revealing their impact on embodied reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the underexplored adversarial robustness of VLAs under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions, focusing on cross-modal misalignment.

Method: VLA-Fool unifies textual, visual, and cross-modal attacks, including gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, patch distortions, and semantic disruption. It also introduces a VLA-aware semantic space for prompts.

Result: Experiments show minor multimodal perturbations cause significant behavioral deviations in VLAs, highlighting their fragility in embodied tasks.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the vulnerability of VLAs to adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for robust multimodal alignment in embodied systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: ICCE introduces adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling to improve unsupervised image clustering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR10 and ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised image classification methods focus solely on clustering after foundational models, leaving room for improvement.

Method: ICCE combines multi-head clustering with adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling, followed by training a classifier using consensus pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet, narrowing the gap with supervised methods.

Conclusion: ICCE is the first fully unsupervised method exceeding 70% accuracy on ImageNet, demonstrating significant progress in unsupervised image classification.

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

*Boyue Xu,Ruichao Hou,Tongwei Ren,Dongming Zhou,Gangshan Wu,Jinde Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwiTrack, a novel framework for cross-modal object tracking (CMOT), addressing issues like modality-specific feature extraction and object drift with specialized streams and dynamic updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMOT methods struggle with extracting distinctive modality-specific features and handling unreliable inputs, leading to object drift.

Method: SwiTrack uses three specialized streams: a visual encoder for RGB frames, a NIR gated adapter for NIR frames, and a consistency trajectory prediction module for invalid modalities. It also employs dynamic template reconstruction and similarity alignment loss.

Result: The tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving precision by 7.2% and success rate by 4.3%, while running at 65 FPS.

Conclusion: SwiTrack effectively addresses CMOT challenges, offering robust and efficient tracking.

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel MLP-based method enhanced with Memory-Block and residual connections for realistic full-body tracking in AR/VR, outperforming existing solutions in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR/VR systems track only head and hands, leaving full-body reconstruction incomplete. This paper aims to address this gap by generating full-body motions from sparse sensor inputs.

Method: The proposed method uses an MLP backbone with residual connections and a Memory-Block component. Memory-Block employs trainable code-vectors to represent missing data, improving temporal consistency. The solution is framed as multi-task learning for robust representations.

Result: The method reduces prediction errors significantly and achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs, enhancing the accuracy-speed tradeoff.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves full-body tracking accuracy and runtime performance, making it suitable for immersive AR/VR applications.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

TL;DR: TetraSDF is a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs using ReLU MLPs with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder, achieving high accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting meshes that exactly match neural SDFs' zero-level set is difficult due to discretization errors or limitations of existing methods.

Method: TetraSDF combines ReLU MLPs with a tetrahedral positional encoder, leveraging barycentric interpolation and a fixed analytic input preconditioner.

Result: TetraSDF outperforms grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy and produces highly self-consistent meshes efficiently.

Conclusion: TetraSDF offers a practical and accurate solution for analytic meshing of neural SDFs.

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: Proposed model offers robust, interpretable, and adaptable weed detection for sustainable precision farming.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

TL;DR: Texture3dgs optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for mobile GPUs, focusing on 2D texture cache efficiency and introducing a novel sorting algorithm, achieving significant speedups and memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage mobile device benefits (privacy, offline operation, speed) by optimizing 3DGS for mobile GPUs, addressing the challenge of 2D texture cache efficiency.

Method: Develops Texture3dgs with a novel sorting algorithm optimized for 2D memory, alongside improved variable layout and other optimizations for 3DGS steps.

Result: Achieves up to 4.1× speedup in sorting, 1.7× overall speedup, and reduces memory usage by 1.6×.

Conclusion: Texture3dgs effectively enhances mobile 3D scene reconstruction efficiency through targeted optimizations.

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Upsample Anything is a test-time optimization framework that upsamples low-resolution features to high-resolution outputs without training, using a learned anisotropic Gaussian kernel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Foundation Models' downsampled representations limit pixel-level applications, and existing upsampling methods suffer from scalability and generalization issues.

Method: Upsample Anything employs per-image optimization to learn an anisotropic Gaussian kernel, combining spatial and range cues, inspired by Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling.

Result: The framework runs in ≈0.419s per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and upsampling tasks.

Conclusion: Upsample Anything offers a lightweight, universal solution for high-resolution reconstruction across architectures and modalities.

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The practical role of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) is debated; this paper aims to clarify their utility by framing them as topic models.

Method: The authors extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces, derive SAE objectives as MAP estimators, and introduce SAE-TM for reusable topic atoms.

Result: SAE-TM produces more coherent topics than baselines while maintaining diversity and is applied to analyze thematic structure in text and image datasets.

Conclusion: SAEs are positioned as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis, demonstrated through SAE-TM's performance and versatility.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ImageNet-1K accuracy fails to reliably predict performance on ecological tasks, highlighting the need for a domain-specific benchmark like BioBench.

Method: BioBench integrates 9 ecology tasks, 4 taxonomic kingdoms, and 6 acquisition modalities, evaluating models with a standardized Python API and lightweight classifiers.

Result: BioBench uncovers gaps ImageNet misses, providing new insights for ecological computer vision and a blueprint for domain-specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: BioBench offers a reliable alternative to ImageNet for ecological vision tasks and serves as a model for AI-for-science benchmarks in other domains.

Abstract: ImageNet-1K linear-probe transfer accuracy remains the default proxy for visual representation quality, yet it no longer predicts performance on scientific imagery. Across 46 modern vision model checkpoints, ImageNet top-1 accuracy explains only 34% of variance on ecology tasks and mis-ranks 30% of models above 75% accuracy. We present BioBench, an open ecology vision benchmark that captures what ImageNet misses. BioBench unifies 9 publicly released, application-driven tasks, 4 taxonomic kingdoms, and 6 acquisition modalities (drone RGB, web video, micrographs, in-situ and specimen photos, camera-trap frames), totaling 3.1M images. A single Python API downloads data, fits lightweight classifiers to frozen backbones, and reports class-balanced macro-F1 (plus domain metrics for FishNet and FungiCLEF); ViT-L models evaluate in 6 hours on an A6000 GPU. BioBench provides new signal for computer vision in ecology and a template recipe for building reliable AI-for-science benchmarks in any domain.

TL;DR: NaTex is a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space, overcoming limitations of traditional 2D multi-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like occluded regions, mesh-texture alignment, and cross-view consistency in texture generation.

Method: Uses latent color diffusion with a geometry-aware color point cloud VAE and multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), trained on 3D data.

Result: NaTex outperforms previous methods in texture coherence and alignment, with strong generalization for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: NaTex provides an efficient and precise solution for 3D texture generation and related applications.

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WWE-UIE is a compact and efficient underwater image enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors—adaptive white balance, wavelet-based enhancement, and gradient-aware modules—to restore visibility and correct color distortions with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from visibility loss and color distortions due to wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Existing hybrid approaches are effective but computationally expensive, limiting real-time applications.

Method: WWE-UIE combines adaptive white balance, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) for multi-band decomposition, and a gradient-aware module (SGFB) using Sobel operators with learnable gating to preserve edges.

Result: Experiments show WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed WWE-UIE is efficient and effective, validated by ablation studies and visualizations, making it suitable for real-time underwater image enhancement.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

*Ching-Heng Cheng,Chih-Chung Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChangeDINO is a multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection that leverages semantic information from non-changing regions and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based RSCD methods underuse semantic information in non-changing regions and struggle with illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels.

Method: The model combines a lightweight backbone with features from frozen DINOv3, uses a spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder, and includes a learnable morphology module for boundary refinement.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show ChangeDINO outperforms recent methods in IoU and F1, with ablation studies confirming component effectiveness.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO enhances robustness and accuracy in optical building change detection, validated by superior performance and open-source availability.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: ARASFSR is a novel face super-resolution method that supports arbitrary resolution and scale, overcoming limitations of fixed scales and input size sensitivity through implicit representation networks and innovative modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSR methods are constrained by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations, limiting their flexibility and practical application.

Method: ARASFSR uses implicit representation networks with three key designs: predicting RGB values via 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and scale ratios; a local frequency estimation module for high-frequency textures; and a global coordinate modulation module leveraging facial structure knowledge.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, outperforming state-of-the-art FSR methods across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Conclusion: ARASFSR offers a flexible and effective solution for face super-resolution, addressing the limitations of existing methods and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a teacher-student framework with key frame selection for aerial terrain classification, improving mIoU and TC using only 30% labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in UAV terrain classification like data scarcity, annotation complexity, and temporal consistency, highlighting shortcomings of fully labeled data.

Method: Uses a teacher-student architecture with key frame selection and updating algorithms for weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieves higher mIoU and temporal consistency with 30% labeled data, ensuring stable terrain object localization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively overcomes traditional TC training limitations in aerial tasks, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time method for camera localization using LiDAR point clouds and neural rendering improves accuracy and reduces drift compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate camera localization is essential for robotics and XR, but current visual methods face issues like drift and scale ambiguity.

Method: The method renders synthetic views from a pre-captured LiDAR point cloud, establishes 2D-3D correspondences, and uses neural rendering to bridge gaps between synthetic and real images. Two variants are developed: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize.

Result: The approach achieves drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale and outperforms existing SLAM pipelines on the ScanNet++ dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating LiDAR point clouds and neural rendering provides a robust solution for precise camera localization in real-time applications.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

*Zhengxue Wang,Zhiqiang Yan,Yuan Wu,Guangwei Gao,Xiang Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOMNet is a novel alignment-free framework for depth super-resolution that adaptively retrieves relevant RGB information despite misalignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome performance degradation in depth super-resolution caused by misaligned RGB-D data due to hardware limitations and calibration drift.

Method: Uses a multi-order matching mechanism (zero-, first-, and second-order) to identify relevant RGB information and integrates it with depth via multi-order aggregation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and shows outstanding robustness in experiments.

Conclusion: MOMNet effectively handles misaligned RGB-D scenarios, offering superior depth reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DetailSemNet introduces a novel approach to offline signature verification (OSV) by focusing on fine-grained differences and local structure matching, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSV methods often rely on holistic features, which may not capture fine-grained details critical for accurate verification.

Method: Proposes DetailSemNet with a Detail Semantics Integrator to enhance local details and discriminative semantics, improving local structure matching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, with improved accuracy, interpretability, and generalization in cross-dataset testing.

Conclusion: DetailSemNet's focus on local details and innovative architecture makes it highly effective and practical for real-world OSV applications.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

*Pan Yang,Cheng Deng,Jing Yang,Han Zhao,Yun Liu,Yuling Chen,Xiaoli Ruan,Yanping Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAMS, a method for compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) that improves disentanglement of attributes and objects using Gated Cross-Attention and Multi-Space Disentanglement, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based CZSL methods struggle with complete disentanglement of attributes and objects due to limited representational capacity.

Method: CAMS uses Gated Cross-Attention to extract fine-grained semantic features from CLIP's image encoder and Multi-Space Disentanglement for better semantic disentanglement.

Result: CAMS outperforms existing methods on benchmarks MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA in closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: CAMS effectively enhances generalization for unseen attribute-object compositions by improving semantic feature extraction and disentanglement.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

*Samer Abualhanud,Christian Grannemann,Max Mehltretter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised method for consistent depth estimation across multiple overlapping images in surround-view setups, using geometry-guided projections and spatial attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for surround-view depth estimation often produce inconsistent depth estimates between overlapping images. This paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The method uses calibrated multi-camera rigs to predict initial depth maps, projects 3D points onto a shared unit cylinder for cross-view consistency, and applies spatial attention based on projected positions to refine depth maps.

Result: Evaluated on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, the approach improves depth consistency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-guided method achieves more consistent and accurate depth estimates in surround-view setups.

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Graph-based segmentation models combining Vision Transformers (ViT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) improve surgical scene segmentation by addressing occlusions and fine-scale geometry challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is crucial for preventing surgical complications in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, especially given the limitations of deep learning models in handling occlusions and rare structures.

Method: Two models integrate ViT feature encoders with GNNs: (1) a static k-NN graph with GCNII for stable long-range information, and (2) a dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with GAT for adaptive topology learning, tested on Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.

Result: The models show 7-8% improvement in mIoU and 6% in mDice scores over baselines, with better performance on thin, rare, and safety-critical structures.

Conclusion: The graph-based methods enhance segmentation performance and anatomical consistency, improving interpretability and reliability for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

*Jin Wang,Bingfeng Zhang,Jian Pang,Mengyu Liu,Honglong Chen,Weifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LDAG, a language-driven approach for few-shot segmentation, leveraging attribute descriptions from LLMs to improve segmentation accuracy for untrained classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation methods rely on support images for meta guidance, which fails due to intra-class variations. The paper suggests that unbiased meta guidance can be better provided through language descriptions.

Method: Introduces LDAG with a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module to generate detailed attribute descriptions via LLMs and a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) module to align text and visual features.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot segmentation.

Conclusion: Language-driven attribute generalization is effective for few-shot segmentation, providing robust support guidance and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreetView-Waste, a dataset for urban waste management tasks, evaluates baseline models, and proposes methods to improve tracking and segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of annotated datasets for monitoring overflowing waste containers in real-world urban logistics.

Method: Presents StreetView-Waste dataset, benchmarks state-of-the-art models, and proposes heuristic-based tracking and geometry-aware segmentation strategies.

Result: Proposed methods reduce counting error by 79.6% for tracking and improve segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% for lightweight models.

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste serves as a valuable benchmark for advancing real-world urban waste management perception systems.

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner introduces a dual-level token pruning method for Vision-Language-Action models, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance by considering both semantic and action-level importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods for VLMs focus solely on semantic salience, neglecting the dual-system nature of VLA models, which harms action execution performance.

Method: VLA-Pruner uses a dual-level importance criterion (semantic relevance via prefill attention and action importance via temporal smoothing) and a token selection strategy to retain informative tokens efficiently.

Result: VLA-Pruner outperforms existing methods across various VLA architectures and robotic tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed VLA-Pruner effectively balances semantic understanding and action execution, making VLA models more efficient and practical for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Motivation: Limited 3D training data prompts the need for alternative methods to improve 3D scene understanding in VLMs.

Method: LLaVA$^3$ uses omnidirectional visual representations from multi-view 2D images, leveraging multi-view 3D reconstruction without fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions in 3D VQA and language grounding tasks.

Conclusion: LLaVA$^3$ demonstrates effective 3D scene understanding without relying on 3D training data.

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

*Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Vasu Singla,Mayuka Jayawardhana,Matthias Zwicker,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sensitivity pruning score and a prune-refine pipeline for compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting models, achieving higher compression ratios and better visual fidelity than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for compressing 3D-GS models degrade visual fidelity and lose foreground details at high compression ratios, limiting their practicality on resource-constrained devices.

Method: The authors propose a principled sensitivity pruning score based on a second-order approximation of reconstruction error and a multi-round prune-refine pipeline applicable to any pretrained 3D-GS model.

Result: Their method prunes 90% of Gaussians, increases rendering speed by 3.56×, and outperforms existing techniques in retaining foreground details and image quality metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves compression efficiency and visual fidelity in 3D-GS models, making them more viable for resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis have enabled real-time rendering speeds with high reconstruction accuracy. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), a foundational point-based parametric 3D scene representation, models scenes as large sets of 3D Gaussians. However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.

*Eliyas Suleyman,Paul Henderson,Eksan Firkat,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores improving occluded video prediction by integrating point-flow and depth information into a standard video prediction model, showing enhanced performance in occlusion scenarios and background motion accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion remains a challenge in video prediction, and the authors hypothesize that explicit motion (point-flow) and geometric structure (depth-maps) information can improve performance in occluded scenarios.

Method: A multi-object latent transformer architecture is modified to incorporate depth and point-flow data, evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets using appearance-based metrics and Wasserstein distances on object masks.

Result: The model with point-flow and depth assistance outperforms standard models in occluded scenarios, achieving more accurate background motion predictions.

Conclusion: Explicit motion and geometric structure information significantly enhance video prediction performance in occlusion-related challenges.

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

TL;DR: A physics-informed deep generative learning framework integrates wave optics and depth alignment into a GAN to synthesize high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on costly, hard-to-acquire microscope image datasets, and existing digital twin techniques fail to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena.

Method: Proposes a GAN integrating wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment to generate synthetic microscope images efficiently.

Result: Improves SSIM by 35.6%, achieves 93.9%/91.9% pose accuracy, and generalizes to unseen poses without additional training.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, high-fidelity synthetic data generation for robust microrobot pose estimation.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

*Rui Wang,Yuexi Du,John Lewin,R. Todd Constable,Nicha C. Dvornek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a time-aware tumor segmentation method for breast DCE-MRI using FiLM layers to improve segmentation accuracy and generalization by accounting for acquisition timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variability in DCE-MRI acquisition protocols and individual factors complicates automated tumor segmentation, necessitating a method that adapts to temporal information.

Method: The approach uses feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers to incorporate acquisition times, modulating model features according to the imaging sequence.

Result: Time-modulated models outperformed baselines, showing improved tumor segmentation and better generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating acquisition time knowledge enhances segmentation performance and model robustness in breast DCE-MRI.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for jointly mapping indoor scenes and registering ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) using synchronized mobile agent and CMC video data, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual or automatic registration of CMCs is inefficient or inaccurate, especially with visual ambiguity. The authors aim to solve this by integrating scene mapping and CMC registration.

Method: A mobile agent with an RGB-D camera traverses the scene while CMCs capture synchronized videos. Trajectories and scene layouts are correlated, and a factor graph optimizes camera poses, layout, and CMC poses.

Result: The proposed method successfully integrates scene mapping and CMC registration, enhancing both tasks' performance, as validated by experiments and a new dataset.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable solution for downstream position-aware applications, addressing inefficiencies and inaccuracies in existing methods.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

TL;DR: SemCLIP improves CLIP's robustness to negation and paraphrasing by using a new contrastive loss function and LLM-generated training triples, enhancing performance on benchmarks and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address CLIP's mixed performance on negated or paraphrased text, which challenges vision-language model alignment.

Method: Introduces SemCLIP with a new contrastive loss function and leverages LLM-generated training triples (original, paraphrased, negated captions).

Result: Boosts original-over-negation accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1% on CC-Neg and outperforms CLIP on downstream zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: SemCLIP enhances robustness to semantic transformations, improving alignment and performance.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

TL;DR: A robust multi-camera tracking method for gymnasts addresses challenges like limited cameras and detection failures by integrating gymnastics knowledge and a cascaded DA paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking gymnasts is challenging due to space restrictions, lighting variations, and occlusions, complicating 3D trajectory determination.

Method: Combines multi-camera triangulation with ray-plane intersection for coplanar 3D trajectories and introduces a cascaded DA paradigm.

Result: The method minimizes tracking failures and outperforms existing techniques, validated in gymnastics championships.

Conclusion: The tracking system is robust and has been successfully applied in international gymnastics events.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for detecting synthetic images improves generalization with supervised contrastive learning and k-NN, achieving high accuracy without exhaustive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the generalization challenge in synthetic image detection due to rapid generative AI advancements.

Method: Uses a vision model trained via contrastive learning for embeddings, followed by a k-NN classifier in a few-shot learning regime.

Result: Achieves 91.3% detection accuracy with only 150 images per class, outperforming existing methods by 5.2%.

Conclusion: The framework offers robust, scalable forensic attribution adaptable to evolving generative AI without retraining.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Conclusion: EOGS++ successfully enhances the EOGS framework, offering sharper reconstructions and better accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, proving its superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting.

TL;DR: VARiant reduces memory overhead in VAR models by using subnets for later scales, optimizing training, and maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory inefficiency in VAR models due to cumulative KV caching while maintaining generation quality.

Method: Use equidistant sampling to create subnets, share weights between subnets and full network, and apply progressive training.

Result: VARiant achieves near-equivalent quality with significant memory reduction (40-80%) and speedup (3.5x) compared to VAR-d30.

Conclusion: VARiant offers flexible, efficient deployment with minimal quality trade-offs.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Result: The model ranks 1st on four benchmarks, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods while using less than 1% computational cost.

Conclusion: Ultra-light models can achieve strong generalization, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning

Method: Introduces POMA-JEPA for geometrically consistent features and uses ScenePoint dataset for pretraining

Result: Strong backbone for diverse 3D tasks like 3D QA, navigation, and retrieval

Conclusion: POMA-3D offers a point map approach to enhance 3D scene understanding

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

*Nirjhor Datta,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Erase to Retain is a framework for targeted forgetting in medical image segmentation without full retraining, using LoRA-based subspace updates and adversarial optimization to remove sensitive data while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision by enabling selective knowledge removal in medical segmentation networks.

Method: Uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with LoRA subspace updates, adversarially optimizing LoRA modules during unlearning and refining with supervised restoration.

Result: Significantly reduces forget-set performance (e.g., ISIC IoU from 0.875 to 0.509) while maintaining retain-set accuracy (e.g., ISIC IoU 0.647 to 0.677).

Conclusion: LoRA-based subspace unlearning offers a practical, controllable, and reversible solution for responsible medical image analysis.

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

### [93] [Adaptive Guided Upsampling for Low-light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16623)
*Angela Vivian Dcosta,Chunbo Song,Rafael Radkowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGU is a method for upscaling low-light images by optimizing multiple quality traits like noise reduction and sharpness, using guided image techniques and multi-parameter optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guided methods fail with low-light images due to high noise and low brightness, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: AGU employs multi-parameter optimization and machine learning to learn associations between low-light and bright image characteristics from sample pairs.

Result: AGU produces high-quality images in real time from low-quality inputs and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AGU effectively addresses the limitations of guided methods for low-light images, delivering superior results in real time.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

*Satyam Gaba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using generative AI to create synthetic smoke datasets for wildfire detection, explores domain adaptation methods, and integrates advanced techniques like GANs to improve realism and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early wildfire detection via smoke plume identification is crucial, but limited annotated datasets hinder deep learning models' effectiveness.

Method: Generative AI synthesizes annotated smoke datasets; unsupervised domain adaptation and advanced generative techniques (style transfer, GANs, image matting) are used to enhance realism and bridge domain gaps.

Result: The approach aims to improve synthetic data realism and reduce disparities between synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: Integrating generative methods can enhance wildfire detection models' accuracy and scalability by addressing data limitations.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

### [95] [Solving Spatial Supersensing Without Spatial Supersensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16655)
*Vishaal Udandarao,Shyamgopal Karthik,Surabhi S. Nath,Andreas Hochlehnert,Matthias Bethge,Ameya Prabhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques Cambrian-S's benchmarks and methods, showing they can be solved without spatial supersensing and may exploit shortcuts rather than robustly measuring spatial cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether Cambrian-S's benchmarks and predictive sensing methods genuinely measure spatial supersensing or rely on unintended shortcuts.

Method: Introduces NoSense baseline (uses SigLIP model) for VSR and VSC-Repeat perturbation for VSC to test benchmark robustness.

Result: NoSense solves VSR with 95% accuracy; VSC-Repeat collapses Cambrian-S's accuracy to 0%, suggesting reliance on shortcuts.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks and methods may not reliably measure spatial supersensing, highlighting the need for more robust evaluations.

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SA-SV, a large surgical iVOS benchmark, and SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing SAM2 for surgical video segmentation, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in surgical video segmentation, such as domain gaps and limited long-term tracking, by creating a comprehensive benchmark and enhancing SAM2.

Method: Constructed SA-SV with spatio-temporal annotations; proposed SAM2S with DiveMem, temporal semantic learning, and ambiguity-resilient learning.

Result: SAM2S achieved 80.42 average J&F, surpassing SAM2 by 17.10 points, with real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: SAM2S and SA-SV significantly advance surgical iVOS, enabling robust long-term tracking and generalization.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization. Code and dataset will be released at https://jinlab-imvr.github.io/SAM2S.

*George Cazenavette,Antonio Torralba,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dataset distillation focuses on creating synthetic images for efficient model training, especially for linear probes on pre-trained models. The proposed Linear Gradient Matching method outperforms real-image baselines and generalizes across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize training linear probes on large, pre-trained vision models by distilling datasets that mimic real data performance efficiently.

Method: Linear Gradient Matching optimizes synthetic images to induce gradients in linear classifiers similar to real data, using pre-trained feature extractors.

Result: Synthetic data outperforms real-image baselines, generalizes across models, and excels in fine-grained classification and model interpretability.

Conclusion: The method enhances efficiency and effectiveness in training linear probes on pre-trained models, offering tools for interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

### [98] [Improving Long-Tailed Object Detection with Balanced Group Softmax and Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16619)
*Satyam Gaba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses long-tailed object detection with enhancements to Balanced Group Softmax and explores metric learning for better feature separation, achieving state-of-the-art results on LVISv1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets exhibit long-tailed distributions, biasing detection models toward frequent classes and degrading performance on rare ones. The paper aims to mitigate this imbalance.

Method: A two-stage Faster R-CNN with Balanced Group Softmax enhancements is used, alongside metric learning for feature separation and k-NN for classification improvement.

Result: The approach achieves a 24.5% mAP on LVISv1, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively improve long-tailed object detection, particularly for rare classes.

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of 3D object reconstruction from single images, particularly in natural scenes with occlusion and scene clutter. It aims to break the '3D data barrier' by leveraging visually grounded 3D reconstruction data.

Method: SAM3D employs a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose. It uses a multi-stage training framework combining synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment.

Result: The model achieves significant improvements over recent work, with a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes.

Conclusion: SAM3D advances 3D object reconstruction from single images and plans to release code, model weights, an online demo, and a new benchmark.

Abstract: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

*Zeyuan Yin,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRIM improves 3D Gaussian diffusion model efficiency by reducing trajectories and pruning redundant primitives without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian diffusion models are slow due to massive primitives and denoising steps, limiting scalability.

Method: TRIM uses trajectory reduction via a lightweight selector and instance mask denoising to prune redundant regions.

Result: TRIM enhances efficiency and quality in 3D generation, supported by experiments.

Conclusion: TRIM accelerates inference while maintaining output quality, enabling scalable 3D diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance in 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) by proposing a late-decoupled framework with an auxiliary discrimination branch and a semantic prototype-based bi-branch supervision mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DHS methods struggle with multi-hierarchy conflicts due to parameter-sharing models and class imbalance across hierarchies, leading to performance dominated by major classes.

Method: A late-decoupled 3DHS framework with multiple decoders and coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance, plus an auxiliary discrimination branch with semantic prototype-based bi-branch supervision.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and can enhance previous methods as a plug-and-play component.

Conclusion: The new approach effectively mitigates multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance, offering improved 3DHS performance and flexibility.

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

TL;DR: A teacher-guided pruning framework integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation for efficient one-shot pruning, outperforming baselines at high sparsity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational overhead of iterative train-prune-retrain cycles in unstructured pruning of deep neural networks.

Method: Leverages teacher-informed gradient signals during importance score calculation for one-shot global pruning, followed by sparsity-aware retraining.

Result: Achieves high sparsity with minimal performance degradation, outperforming EPG, EPSD, and COLT on image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computation-efficient, performance-preserving pruning solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartUV introduces a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that reduces chart fragmentation and optimizes boundaries for AI-generated meshes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UV unwrapping methods perform poorly on noisy, bumpy AI-generated meshes, leading to fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries.

Method: PartUV combines semantic part decomposition (using PartField) with geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework, ensuring low distortion and minimal charts.

Result: Outperforms existing tools in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, and handles challenging meshes effectively.

Conclusion: PartUV advances UV unwrapping for AI-generated meshes, enabling new applications like part-specific packing.

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

TL;DR: TriDiff-4D improves 4D avatar generation using diffusion-based triplane re-posing, achieving high-quality, temporally consistent results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations like inconsistencies, artifacts, and computational costs in current 4D avatar generation methods.

Method: Uses diffusion-based triplane re-posing and auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences, learning 3D structure and motion priors from datasets.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time and improving motion accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: TriDiff-4D offers a scalable, efficient solution for high-quality 4D avatar generation.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneDesigner is a method for precise multi-object 9D pose manipulation, addressing controllability and quality issues in existing approaches using a branched network, CNOCS maps, and a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with controllability and quality when manipulating 9D poses of multiple objects. SceneDesigner aims to overcome these limitations for more accurate and flexible pose control.

Method: SceneDesigner uses a branched network with CNOCS maps for 9D pose encoding, trains on the ObjectPose9D dataset, and employs a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning for data imbalance. Disentangled Object Sampling improves inference.

Result: SceneDesigner outperforms existing methods in controllability and quality, demonstrating effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner provides a robust solution for multi-object 9D pose manipulation, offering improved performance and customization capabilities.

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.

### [107] [Video-as-Answer: Predict and Generate Next Video Event with Joint-GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16669)
*Junhao Cheng,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP) as a new task requiring video responses instead of text. It proposes VANS, a model combining Vision-Language and Video Diffusion Models with reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video's ability to convey physical-world information better than text motivates extending Next-Event Prediction (NEP) to video responses (VNEP).

Method: VANS uses reinforcement learning (Joint-GRPO) to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for generating consistent videos.

Result: VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in video event prediction and visualization on procedural and predictive benchmarks.

Conclusion: VNEP and VANS advance procedural learning and creative exploration by shifting from telling to showing, supported by multimodal understanding and generation.

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

### [108] [Learning to Think Fast and Slow for Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16670)
*Chenyu Lin,Cheng Chi,Jinlin Wu,Sharon Li,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualMindVLM proposes a dual-mode thinking mechanism for VLMs, switching between fast and slow thinking based on task difficulty, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs focus on lengthy reasoning chains, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by human cognitive resource allocation, the paper aims to balance efficiency and accuracy.

Method: A two-stage RL approach labels data as fast or slow thinking based on output length, then trains the model (DualMindVLM) using GRPO to develop dual-mode thinking.

Result: DualMindVLM outperforms the base model and matches state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high token efficiency.

Conclusion: The dual-mode approach effectively balances computational cost and reasoning accuracy, offering a practical solution for efficient visual language models.

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoLMM proposes a self-evolving framework with two cooperative agents (Proposer and Solver) to enhance LMM reasoning unsupervised, achieving ~3% gains on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LMM reasoning autonomously without human-curated data or reward models.

Method: Uses a self-evolving framework with Proposer (questions) and Solver (answers) agents, learning through self-rewarding feedback.

Result: Achieves ~3% improvement on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks like ChartQA.

Conclusion: EvoLMM is a simple, effective baseline for unsupervised self-improving LMMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/EvoLMM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar reconstructs animatable 3D human avatars from images without relying on pose inputs, outperforming methods that depend on noisy pose estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on accurate camera and human poses, which degrade performance if poses are noisy.

Method: Introduced NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, eliminating pose dependence.

Result: NoPo-Avatar outperformed baselines in practical settings (no ground-truth poses) and matched lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

Conclusion: Eliminating pose dependence makes NoPo-Avatar more robust and widely applicable.

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

TL;DR: Motion2Mind is a framework evaluating machine Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities in interpreting nonverbal cues (NVCs), revealing AI struggles with detection and explanation compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM benchmarks focus narrowly on false-belief tasks, ignoring diverse mental states and nonverbal communication. Motion2Mind aims to address this gap.

Method: Motion2Mind uses an expert-curated body-language reference and a video dataset with fine-grained NVC annotations (222 cue types, 397 mind states) for evaluation.

Result: AI systems perform poorly in NVC interpretation, showing detection gaps and over-interpretation patterns compared to human benchmarks.

Conclusion: Motion2Mind highlights AI's limitations in understanding nonverbal cues, suggesting significant room for improvement in machine ToM capabilities.

Abstract: Our ability to interpret others' mental states through nonverbal cues (NVCs) is fundamental to our survival and social cohesion. While existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks have primarily focused on false-belief tasks and reasoning with asymmetric information, they overlook other mental states beyond belief and the rich tapestry of human nonverbal communication. We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes TOD-ProcBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions in multi-turn task-oriented dialogues, featuring intricate constraints and three tasks to assess comprehension, violation detection, and conditional response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify complex instructions in task-oriented dialogues, necessitating a more realistic and challenging evaluation framework.

Method: Introduces TOD-ProcBench with complex process instructions and multi-level condition-action statements, and designs three tasks: retrieving relevant statements, identifying instruction violations, and generating conditional responses.

Result: Benchmark includes high-quality conversations and instruction documents, evaluating LLMs' performance across multilingual settings and instruction formats.

Conclusion: TOD-ProcBench addresses gaps in evaluating LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in realistic dialogue settings, released under Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

Abstract: In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

TL;DR: LIARS' BENCH is introduced as a testbed with 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses from four models across seven datasets, highlighting limitations in existing lie detection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the narrow validation settings of prior lie detection techniques for large language models (LLMs) and capture diverse types of lies.

Method: Created LIARS' BENCH, a testbed with lies and honest responses from four models across seven datasets, varying by reason for lying and belief target. Evaluated three lie detection techniques.

Result: Existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain lie types, especially when transcripts alone are insufficient for detection.

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH exposes limitations in prior techniques and offers a practical framework for advancing lie detection research.

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

*Gwen Yidou-Weng,Ian Li,Anji Liu,Oliver Broadrick,Guy Van den Broeck,Benjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTLA is a hybrid method combining autoregressive LMs with tractable surrogate models for controlled language generation, avoiding efficiency pitfalls by using batched updates and fixed surrogate decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for controlled language generation using tractable surrogates suffer from weak context awareness, reducing query quality.

Method: LTLA pairs a base LM with a fixed surrogate model, using batched HMM updates and conditioning surrogate latent states on LM hidden representations for efficiency.

Result: LTLA achieves higher conditional likelihood, better approximates continuation distributions, and improves constraint satisfaction with minimal inference overhead.

Conclusion: LTLA effectively addresses efficiency and context-awareness issues in controlled language generation, outperforming standalone surrogate models.

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

TL;DR: Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) improves prompt optimization by combining voting mechanisms, shared strategies, and efficient algorithms, outperforming existing methods like evolutionary algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prompt engineering is tedious, and existing APO methods lack robustness for complex tasks due to reliance on single models/algorithms.

Method: ELPO uses ensemble learning with voting mechanisms, shared generation strategies, and diverse search methods to optimize prompts efficiently.

Result: ELPO achieves superior performance, e.g., boosting F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ELPO provides a more accurate and robust solution for prompt optimization, addressing limitations of current APO approaches.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

TL;DR: The paper questions the traditional PEFT approach of modifying all position indices and introduces Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), which selectively applies modifications to a subset, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the necessity of indiscriminate PEFT modifications and explore a more targeted approach for resource-efficient fine-tuning in large models.

Method: Introduces TS-PEFT, where a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to specific position indices instead of all.

Result: Experiments show that indiscriminate PEFT is unnecessary and may harm performance, while TS-PEFT enhances downstream task performance.

Conclusion: The study advocates for targeted PEFT modifications and provides a framework for optimizing fine-tuning in large models.

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.

*Xingtao Zhao,Hao Peng,Dingli Su,Xianghua Zeng,Chunyang Liu,Jinzhi Liao,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeSE introduces a UQ framework leveraging latent semantic structural information for hallucination detection in LLMs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable UQ is crucial for LLMs in safety-critical scenarios to avoid falsehoods, but current methods overlook latent semantic structures.

Method: SeSE uses an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph and hierarchical abstraction to quantify uncertainty via structural entropy.

Result: SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines across 29 model-dataset combinations.

Conclusion: SeSE provides principled, explicable UQ for LLMs, enhancing hallucination detection.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

*Wei Xia,Zhi-Hong Deng*

TL;DR: SDA is a training-free, model-agnostic framework for aligning LLM outputs with human intent, improving performance in helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLMs align with human intent during inference without costly retraining is a critical challenge.

Method: SDA dynamically adjusts output probabilities based on user-defined instructions, avoiding fine-tuning.

Result: SDA improved helpfulness by 64.4%, honesty by 30%, and harmlessness by 11.5% across 8 LLMs.

Conclusion: SDA is effective, lightweight, and compatible with diverse LLMs, offering flexible alignment during inference.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-rewriting framework improves reasoning quality in large reasoning models by rewriting internal texts, enhancing accuracy and reducing reasoning length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current outcome correctness rewards in reinforcement learning lack detailed supervision over internal reasoning, leading to suboptimal reasoning quality.

Method: Introduces self-rewriting where models rewrite reasoning texts, focusing on 'simple' samples for rewriting to preserve original rewards, with minimal overhead.

Result: Self-rewriting improves accuracy (+0.6) and reduces reasoning length (-46%), while enhancing internal reasoning quality (+7.2 score).

Conclusion: The self-rewriting framework effectively mitigates internal reasoning flaws and outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

*Blake Matheny,Phuong Minh Nguyen,Minh Le Nguyen,Stephanie Reynolds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of idioms and figurative language in NLP by creating datasets to improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Idioms and figurative language are common but difficult for LLMs to handle, despite large corpora.

Method: Combined idiom lists from existing datasets were used to create new datasets for training and evaluation.

Result: Three datasets were developed: one large-scale and two human-annotated, tested on idiom detection tasks.

Conclusion: Finetuning with better datasets can improve LLMs' idiom recognition, bridging the gap in NLP.

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

### [123] [Learning from Sufficient Rationales: Analysing the Relationship Between Explanation Faithfulness and Token-level Regularisation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16353)
*Jonathan Kamp,Lisa Beinborn,Antske Fokkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how rationales (human explanations) affect model performance, noting that sufficiency metrics alone are insufficient. It examines token classification and attention regularization, finding inconsistencies and complexities in rationale impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how rationales influence model performance and metrics like sufficiency, and to explore their role in token classification and attention regularization.

Method: The study analyzes rationales through token classification and attention regularization, evaluating their sufficiency and impact on model performance across tasks and domains.

Result: Highly informative rationales don't necessarily aid correct classification, and sufficiency captures interference from non-rationale context. Rationale-based inputs can boost cross-domain performance, but results vary. Sufficiency and token classification are unrelated.

Conclusion: Rationales are complex, and better metrics are needed to systematically assess their informativeness and impact on model behavior.

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinerU-HTML improves HTML-to-text extraction quality using a language model, outperforming heuristic methods and enhancing downstream model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing heuristic-based HTML extractors often fail to preserve structured elements (e.g., formulas, codes), limiting web data quality for language models.

Method: MinerU-HTML reformulates extraction as a sequence labeling task using a 0.6B-parameter model, explicitly categorizing semantic elements before converting to Markdown.

Result: Achieves 81.8% ROUGE-N F1 (vs. 63.6% for Trafilatura) and high structured element preservation (90.9% code blocks, 94.0% formulas). Pretraining on MinerU-HTML-extracted data boosts model accuracy by 1.08pp.

Conclusion: HTML extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities, and MinerU-HTML provides a scalable, high-quality solution.

Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.

*Connor McElroy,Thiago E. A. de Oliveira,Chris Brogly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study compares supervised ML/DL models to distinguish low vs. high-quality news, showing deep learning outperforms traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if ML/DL models can effectively classify news article quality using linguistic features.

Method: Evaluated 3 ML classifiers and 3 DL models on 1.4M articles labeled by expert consensus.

Result: Random Forest (ML) achieved 0.7355 accuracy, while ModernBERT-large (DL) led with 0.8744 accuracy.

Conclusion: Both ML and DL can differentiate news quality, with DL models performing notably better.

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based language models process idiomatic expressions and uncover computational patterns involved.

Method: Uses modified path patching for circuit discovery, analyzes 'Idiom Heads' and 'augmented reception' phenomena.

Result: Identifies distinct computational patterns in idiom processing, showing how transformers balance efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: Findings offer insights into non-compositional language processing and suggest directions for studying complex grammatical constructions.

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

TL;DR: TurkColBERT introduces a benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish IR, demonstrating superior efficiency and performance of smaller late-interaction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of neural IR for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages like Turkish, where dense bi-encoders dominate but late-interaction models lack systematic evaluation.

Method: A two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English/multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks and converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. Evaluates 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets.

Result: Late-interaction models outperform dense encoders; ColmmBERT-base-TR achieves up to +13.8% mAP. MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33x faster than PLAID with +1.7% mAP gain.

Conclusion: TurkColBERT shows late-interaction models' efficiency and effectiveness for Turkish IR, though limitations include reliance on translated benchmarks and moderately sized datasets.

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a predictive framework to infer text genres from LLM activations, achieving high accuracy with shallow learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs is crucial for their safe deployment, but their complexity and lack of interpretability pose challenges. This study aims to demonstrate that text genres can be predicted from LLM activations.

Method: The authors use Mistral-7B and two datasets to predict text genres from LLM activations, employing scikit-learn classifiers for evaluation.

Result: Genre extraction achieved F1-scores of up to 98% and 71%, consistently outperforming control tasks, proving the concept.

Conclusion: Shallow learning models can effectively infer text genres from LLM activations, offering a promising direction for interpretability research.

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the reliance on Word Error Rate (WER) for evaluating ASR in clinical dialogue, showing poor correlation with clinical impact. It introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge optimized with GEPA to achieve human-comparable accuracy in assessing clinical risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR evaluations in clinical settings prioritize textual fidelity (WER) but overlook clinical impact. This work aims to align evaluation metrics with actual clinical risks posed by transcription errors.

Method: Experts labeled clinical impact discrepancies in doctor-patient dialogues. The study compared these labels to standard metrics and introduced an LLM-as-a-Judge optimized via GEPA to replicate expert assessments.

Result: WER and other metrics poorly correlated with clinician-assigned risk labels. The optimized LLM judge achieved 90% accuracy and a Cohen's κ of 0.816, matching human performance.

Conclusion: The study validates an automated framework for assessing ASR safety in clinical dialogue, shifting focus from textual fidelity to clinical impact.

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

*Kexin Zhao,Ken Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for word sense disambiguation using statistical language models without hand-annotated data, evaluated against human-annotated answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on coarse-grained representations and hand-annotated data, limiting automatic disambiguation of richer representations.

Method: Uses statistical language models as oracles; symbolic NLU system generates meanings converted into natural language alternatives, queried by an LLM for selection.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness by evaluating against human-annotated gold answers.

Conclusion: Proposed method enables disambiguation of richer representations without hand-annotated training data.

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper compares text-based chunk retrieval with direct multimodal embedding retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, showing the latter outperforms by preserving visual context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal RAG systems lose visual details by summarizing images into text, limiting retrieval and question-answering accuracy.

Method: Comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches evaluated on a financial benchmark with 6 LLM and 2 multimodal embedding models.

Result: Direct multimodal embedding retrieval improves mAP@5 by 13% and nDCG@5 by 11% over text-based methods, with more accurate answers.

Conclusion: Direct multimodal retrieval avoids information loss, enhancing retrieval and inference performance compared to LLM summarization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how uncooperative behaviors impact multi-agent systems and their stability.

Method: Includes a game theory-based taxonomy of behaviors and a multi-stage simulation pipeline for dynamic behavior generation.

Result: Framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic behaviors; uncooperative agents cause rapid system collapse.

Conclusion: Uncooperative behaviors severely degrade system stability, emphasizing the need for resilient multi-agent designs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and analyzing how uncooperative behaviors can destabilize or collapse LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds. These findings demonstrate that uncooperative agents can significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weaknesses like inconsistency and hallucination in individual LLMs for text categorization.

Method: Integrates multiple LLMs into an ensemble framework, formalized through collective decision-making math, and evaluated using the IAB taxonomy on 8,660 samples.

Result: eLLM improves robustness and accuracy, achieving near human-expert-level performance and reducing reliance on human labeling.

Conclusion: The eLLM framework offers a scalable, reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification, outperforming single models.

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern reasoning systems often repeat similar computations, wasting resources and increasing latency. The paper addresses this inefficiency by proposing persistent reasoning mechanisms.

Method: Graph-Memoized Reasoning encodes past decision graphs and retrieves them via structural/semantic similarity, enabling reuse. It includes an optimization objective balancing efficiency and consistency.

Result: The framework minimizes reasoning costs while managing inconsistency, laying the foundation for efficient, interpretable, and self-improving reasoning systems.

Conclusion: Graph-Memoized Reasoning advances persistent memory in agentic systems, offering cost-efficient and reusable reasoning workflows.

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Erhan Bilal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how different modalities (text and images) affect perception in ARC-AGI tasks, finding structured text excels in precise coordinates while images capture 2D shapes but are resolution-sensitive. Combining modalities improves execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how modality affects perception in ARC-AGI tasks and how to optimize instruction execution by aligning representations with transformer inductive biases.

Method: Isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline.

Result: Structured text yields precise coordinates; images capture 2D shapes but are resolution-sensitive. Combining modalities improves execution (8 perception points; 0.20 median similarity).

Conclusion: Aligning representations with transformer biases and cross-validating text and image modalities enhances instruction accuracy and execution reliability without modifying the model.

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

### [138] [MACIE: Multi-Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer for Collective Behavior Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15716)
*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MACIE is a framework for explaining decisions in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, using causal models, counterfactuals, and Shapley values to attribute contributions, quantify emergent behaviors, and provide actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding individual agent decisions and collective behaviors in MARL is vital for safety-critical applications, but existing explainable AI methods fall short in multi-agent settings.

Method: MACIE combines structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to analyze causal contributions, emergent intelligence, and generate natural language explanations.

Result: MACIE accurately attributes outcomes (mean phi_i = 5.07), detects emergent behaviors (synergy index up to 0.461), and operates efficiently (0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU).

Conclusion: MACIE advances interpretable and accountable MARL by integrating causal rigor, emergence quantification, and practicality for real-time use.

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

*Hanzhi Yan,Qin Lu,Xianqiao Wang,Xiaoming Zhai,Tianming Liu,He Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining LLMs and AI agents to improve biomechanics education assistants, using RAG for conceptual questions and MAS for calculation tasks, showing significant performance enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLMs' limitations in domain-specific applications and complex reasoning tasks, particularly in biomechanics education.

Method: A dual-module framework: RAG enhances LLM responses for conceptual questions; MAS handles multi-step reasoning and calculations.

Result: RAG improves LLM performance in conceptual questions; MAS successfully handles equation derivation and code execution.

Conclusion: RAG and MAS enhance LLMs' effectiveness in specialized engineering courses, offering potential for intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolMind introduces a large-scale, high-quality dataset for LLM agents, with fine-grained validation to reduce errors and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality trajectories hinders LLM agent development, and existing validation methods overlook turn-level errors.

Method: ToolMind synthesizes 160k data instances using a multi-agent framework and validates them with fine-grained turn-level filtering.

Result: Models fine-tuned on ToolMind significantly outperform baselines on benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToolMind addresses data quality issues and enhances LLM agent performance through rigorous validation.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

TL;DR: A method called Chain of Summaries (CoS) generates dense, general-purpose summaries to make web content more digestible for LLMs, outperforming baselines and specialized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with web content due to unfriendly formats and context length limits.

Method: CoS iteratively refines summaries using Hegel's dialectical method (thesis-antithesis-synthesis).

Result: CoS outperforms zero-shot LLMs by 66% and specialized methods by 27%, improving Q&A performance with fewer tokens.

Conclusion: CoS offers a viable solution for making web content LLM-friendly while allowing human oversight.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multimodal AI framework combining text and image analysis enhances construction safety by identifying hazards from diverse data sources like reports and site imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accident data in construction sites exists in varied formats (text, images), making hazard synthesis challenging. The goal is to improve safety using multimodal AI.

Method: Proposed framework uses LLMs (GPT 4o, GPT 4o mini) for text analysis and VLMs (Molmo 7B, Qwen2 VL 2B) for image-text tasks. Case studies evaluated these models on OSHA reports and ConstructionSite10k dataset.

Result: Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B performed competitively despite smaller size, showing promise for low-resource multimodal safety monitoring.

Conclusion: Multimodal AI frameworks are feasible for construction safety, with lightweight models offering cost-effective solutions.

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cognitive taxonomy for spatial reasoning in MLLMs, reviews benchmarks and metrics, and analyzes improvement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of spatial reasoning in MLLMs by proposing a cognitive-based taxonomy to bridge gaps between models and human-like capabilities.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy organizing spatial intelligence by cognitive functions and reasoning complexity, mapping benchmarks and reviewing evaluation metrics.

Result: Highlights critical gaps in model capabilities and provides insights into training and reasoning-based improvement methods.

Conclusion: Offers a comprehensive overview and actionable research directions for advancing spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning systems often suffer from noise, low-quality labels, and modality heterogeneity, especially in human-computer interaction settings. This thesis aims to address these challenges.

Method: The framework uses cross-modal semantic consistency to project heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, mitigating modality gaps and supporting uncertainty estimation.

Result: Experiments show improved model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy supervision. Latent space analyses reveal reliable cross-modal structures.

Conclusion: The thesis provides a unified approach for resilient multimodal learning, integrating uncertainty modeling and semantic alignment for reliable brain-computer interface systems.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

*Philip Drammeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent orchestration significantly improves LLM-based incident response quality, achieving 100% actionable recommendations compared to 1.7% for single-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent LLMs produce vague recommendations, limiting their usability in incident response.

Method: A reproducible containerized framework (MyAntFarm.ai) was used to compare single-agent and multi-agent systems across 348 trials.

Result: Multi-agent systems showed 100% actionable recommendations, 80x better specificity, and 140x better correctness than single-agent approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration is essential for production-ready LLM-based incident response due to deterministic quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the gap in assessing AI supply chain risks and proposes a taxonomy for categorizing AI supply chain entities to aid stakeholders in risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked risks in AI supply chains, especially in critical applications, where current risk assessments are insufficient.

Method: The authors survey existing AI risk assessments and introduce a taxonomy for AI supply chain entities to guide systematic risk evaluation.

Result: The proposed taxonomy helps non-expert stakeholders systematically assess and manage AI supply chain risks.

Conclusion: The paper bridges a gap in AI governance by providing actionable tools for managing AI supply chain risks in critical applications.

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text in non-English contexts, where NLP resources are scarce.

Method: Comparative analysis of low-compute rule-based NLP methods and LLMs for extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications from Polish EHRs, examining text normalization and translation effects.

Result: Rule-based methods outperform LLMs in accuracy for age and sex extraction, while LLMs excel in drug name recognition. Translation impacts LLM effectiveness.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining rule-based precision with LLM adaptability are recommended for reliable, resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world healthcare settings.

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the training of medical professionals in interpreting chest X-rays by integrating advanced technologies like spatial annotation, gaze analysis, and vision-language reasoning into a responsive tutoring system.

Method: The system uses AutoGen-based workflows with specialized agents for tasks like evaluating localization quality, generating coaching, retrieving evidence, and triggering vision-language reasoning. It includes Bayesian Knowledge Tracing for skill mastery estimation and a lung-lobe segmentation module for gaze feedback.

Result: Preliminary evaluation indicates that IMACT-CXR improves localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR demonstrates effective tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and potential for live residency deployment.

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MAPs provides a unified environment for benchmarking adaptable decision-making agents, addressing gaps in current AI capabilities.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Motivation: The paper addresses the puzzling observation that audio language models perform better with minimal or no reasoning, questioning whether audio intelligence can truly benefit from deliberate thinking.

Method: The authors propose Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) to train Step-Audio-R1, enabling it to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains grounded in acoustic features.

Result: Step-Audio-R1 surpasses Gemini 2.5 Pro and matches Gemini 3 Pro in audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks across speech, environmental sounds, and music.

Conclusion: Reasoning is transferable across modalities when properly anchored, transforming deliberation into an asset for audio intelligence and paving the way for multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms driving improved ToM in language models when using activation steering, particularly how emotional versus analytical processes contribute.

Method: Decomposed ToM by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs using linear probes on 45 cognitive actions, applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B, and evaluated on 1,000 BigToM scenarios.

Result: Improved belief attribution accuracy (32.5% to 46.7%) linked to enhanced emotional processing (emotion perception +2.23, valuing +2.20) and suppressed analytical processes (questioning -0.78, convergent thinking -1.59).

Conclusion: Successful ToM in LLMs is mediated by emotional understanding rather than analytical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reliability and faithfulness of LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps, not just final answers.

Method: The method involves a composite reward function leveraging self-assessed confidence and token-level entropy spikes, guided by RL to shape generation behavior.

Result: Experiments showed improved final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations confirming each signal's contribution.

Conclusion: The framework enhances coherence and faithfulness in LLMs' reasoning.

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

TL;DR: JudgeBoard is a pipeline for evaluating reasoning correctness directly without ground-truth comparisons. The MAJ framework uses multi-agent SLMs to match LLM judgment accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs struggle with judging answer correctness compared to LLMs, and current evaluation methods are indirect and lack scalability.

Method: JudgeBoard evaluates answers directly via queries, focusing on math/science/commonsense reasoning. MAJ uses collaborative SLMs for improved judgments.

Result: SLMs initially lag behind LLMs, but MAJ bridges the gap, even outperforming LLMs in some cases (e.g., MATH dataset).

Conclusion: Multi-agent SLM systems can rival LLMs in judgment tasks, offering scalable and efficient evaluation solutions.

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

*Zhe Li,Yehan Qiu,Yujie Chen,Xiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KRAL enhances clinical LLMs with low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving techniques, outperforming traditional methods like RAG and SFT in accuracy and reasoning while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in high-stakes clinical decisions (knowledge gaps, privacy, cost, reasoning) by improving knowledge and reasoning efficiently.

Method: Uses reverse generation for knowledge distillation, heuristic learning for data augmentation, and agentic reinforcement learning for joint optimization. Modular design aids updates.

Result: Outperforms RAG and SFT: MEDQA Accuracy@1 +1.8% vs. SFT, +3.6% vs. RAG; PUMCH Pass@1 +27% vs. SFT/RAG. Achieves ~20% of SFT's training costs.

Conclusion: KRAL effectively enhances local LLMs for clinical use, enabling cost-efficient, safe deployment in complex medical decision support.

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel dual-method system combines semantic drift analysis and canary baseline comparison to detect backdoored LLMs in real-time with high accuracy and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of practical detection methods for backdoored LLMs (sleeper agents) that persist through safety training.

Method: Uses Sentence-BERT embeddings for semantic drift analysis and injected canary questions to monitor response consistency.

Result: Achieves 92.5% accuracy, 100% precision, and 85% recall on the dolphin-llama3-8B model, operating in real-time without model modification.

Conclusion: The method effectively identifies deceptive LLM behavior, filling a critical security gap in AI deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper examines the gap between retrieval and reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using clinical therapy guidelines, finding persistent errors even with authoritative evidence, and proposes an evaluation framework to improve reasoning fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the critical gap between retrieved evidence and correct reasoning in LLMs, particularly in clinical settings where structured protocols are essential.

Method: The authors use Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed, evaluate model responses to clinician-vetted questions, and propose an evaluation framework focusing on accuracy, consistency, and reasoning fidelity.

Result: Despite providing authoritative passages, errors persist in model responses. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but rigorous reasoning assessment is needed for safe deployment.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of RAG but emphasizes the necessity of evaluating reasoning as rigorously as retrieval to ensure safe and accurate model outputs in clinical applications.

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Motivation: Digital transformation in cultural heritage faces challenges integrating heterogeneous data; MuseKG addresses this gap.

Method: Uses symbolic-neural integration to build a typed property graph linking objects, people, labels, and supports natural language queries.

Result: Outperforms zero-shot, few-shot, and SPARQL baselines, demonstrating robust query performance.

Conclusion: Symbolic grounding is key for scalable heritage reasoning, enabling web-scale integration.

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

### [160] [An Aligned Constraint Programming Model For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16045)
*Jorge A. Huertas,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Constraint Programming (CP) model for serial batch scheduling with minimum batch sizes, avoiding predefined virtual batches. It outperforms existing methods on small-to-medium instances and offers significant improvements on large-scale instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CP models for serial batch scheduling rely on a predefined virtual set of batches, which complicates the problem due to dimensionality. The paper aims to simplify this by eliminating the need for such virtual sets.

Method: The proposed CP model uses alignment parameters to directly reason about job sequences, ensuring a compact formulation. It enhances the model with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels for constraint propagation.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 25% better solutions on large-scale instances (500 jobs, 10 families, 10 machines) and superior performance on small-to-medium instances (up to 100 jobs).

Conclusion: The novel CP model simplifies serial batch scheduling by eliminating virtual batches, offering better performance and scalability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of GenAI and LLMs on accounting research and identify opportunities for scholars.

Method: Proposes a two-dimensional framework (research focus and methodological approach) and applies it to existing studies.

Result: AI democratizes research but intensifies competition, highlighting areas where human judgment remains valuable.

Conclusion: Accounting scholars should adapt doctoral education to build AI fluency and leverage human strengths.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a proactive framework combining CNN-LSTM for forecasting and multi-agent DRL for resource management, outperforming reactive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reactive resource management leads to overspending or performance issues; proactive solutions are needed.

Method: Hybrid architecture using CNN-LSTM for time series forecasting and multi-agent DRL for orchestration, embedding predictions into DRL's state space.

Result: System outperforms old methods, balancing cost, speed, and reliability effectively.

Conclusion: Combining forecasting and DRL enables smarter, long-term resource management decisions.

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

Motivation: To enhance agent training efficiency and performance, especially in software engineering tasks, while reducing costs.

Method: Uses optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher and AST-based search tool for code navigation, improving training efficiency.

Result: SA-SWE-32B achieves 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench with 2x cost reduction, and generalizes well to other tasks.

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent is effective for training high-performance agents efficiently and extends to various agentic tasks.

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MR-RML via GPRC, a framework to align LLMs with medical standards, addressing limitations in static benchmarks and reward models, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in medicine face alignment challenges like static benchmarks, evolving standards, and inadequate reward models.

Method: MR-RML integrates medical standards into a structured matrix, uses a multi-dimensional reward model, and applies geometric projection constraints.

Result: Substantial gains over Qwen-32B (45% on full subset, 85% on hard subset), achieving SOTA among open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: MR-RML effectively aligns LLMs with clinical needs, outperforming many closed-source models.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve the reliability of play-by-play data extraction in soccer by combining tactical knowledge with computer-vision outputs.

Method: Introduces FOOTPASS, a multi-modal dataset blending STAD, MOT, and soccer tactics for player-centric action spotting.

Result: Provides a benchmark enabling development of methods for generating reliable play-by-play data streams.

Conclusion: FOOTPASS supports automated sports analytics by integrating tactical priors with vision-based predictions.

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

TL;DR: The paper advocates for explainable automated algorithm design by combining LLM-driven discovery, explainable benchmarking, and problem-class descriptors to shift from blind search to interpretable, class-specific solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based automated algorithm design is performance-driven but lacks transparency. The paper aims to bridge this gap by integrating understanding with automation.

Method: Proposes three pillars: (i) LLM-driven algorithmic variant discovery, (ii) explainable benchmarking linking performance to components, and (iii) problem-class descriptors connecting behavior to landscape structure.

Result: A closed knowledge loop where discovery, explanation, and generalization reinforce each other, enabling interpretable, class-specific algorithm design.

Conclusion: This approach will accelerate progress and provide reusable scientific insights into why and when optimization strategies succeed.

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

TL;DR: CRM introduces a multi-agent framework for RLHF, replacing single reward models with specialist evaluators to enhance robustness and interpretability by decomposing preferences into domain-specific signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional reward models in handling multiple conflicting preference dimensions and lack of transparency.

Method: CRM uses domain-specific agents and global evaluators to produce partial signals, aggregated centrally for training rewards, optimized with advantage-based updates.

Result: CRM enhances transparency and robustness in reward modeling, enabling stable optimization without additional human annotations.

Conclusion: CRM and rewardBench offer a practical, modular approach for transparent reward modeling and stable optimization in RLHF.

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Conclusion: ChemO and ChemLabs set a new standard for automated chemical problem-solving.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

TL;DR: An automated pipeline extracts high-quality QA/VQA pairs from educational documents using OCR and LLM-based parsing, offering a scalable alternative to synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality supervised data for LLMs is costly and synthetic data suffers from hallucinations and limited diversity. Educational materials offer underexploited QA content.

Method: Combines layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing to extract QA/VQA pairs from PDFs.

Result: Produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs across diverse documents.

Conclusion: This method enables scalable use of educational content and improves reasoning-oriented LLM training by reducing reliance on synthetic data.

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

### [170] [Revisiting Fairness-aware Interactive Recommendation: Item Lifecycle as a Control Knob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16248)
*Yun Lu,Xiaoyu Shi,Hong Xie,Chongjun Xia,Zhenhui Gong,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces lifecycle-aware fairness in interactive recommendation systems, proposing LHRL, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, to balance fairness and accuracy dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommendation systems often lack fairness-awareness, especially regarding item lifecycles, which follow a unique compressed pattern in short-video platforms.

Method: The authors develop LHRL, a framework with PhaseFormer for lifecycle phase detection and a two-level HRL agent for balancing fairness and engagement.

Result: Experiments show LHRL improves fairness and user engagement, and its lifecycle-aware rewards enhance existing models.

Conclusion: The lifecycle-aware approach effectively balances fairness and utility, offering practical and generalizable benefits for recommendation systems.

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

*Zhiyuan Li,Haisheng Yu,Guangchuan Guo,Nan Zhou,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuISQA benchmark to evaluate multi-intent RAG systems and proposes an intent-aware retrieval framework for improved evidence coverage and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems often fail to cover diverse intents in complex scientific questions, leading to incomplete evidence.

Method: Proposes an intent-aware retrieval framework using LLMs to decompose queries, retrieve intent-specific passages, and re-rank results via RRF.

Result: The method outperforms conventional approaches in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage on MuISQA and general RAG datasets.

Conclusion: The intent-aware framework effectively addresses multi-intent challenges in scientific question answering, improving retrieval performance.

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenMMReasoner introduces a transparent two-stage training recipe for multimodal reasoning, combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies in multimodal reasoning research.

Method: A two-stage approach: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with a rigorously validated dataset, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) using diverse domain data.

Result: Achieves an 11.6% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across nine benchmarks, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of data quality and training design, providing a scalable foundation for future multimodal reasoning research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Demonstrates agent-to-agent communication in distributed systems using natural language and pseudonymised tokens, ensuring privacy and data locality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore secure cooperation among organisations (Clinic, Insurer, Specialist) without shared identifiers or centralised data exchange.

Method: Uses Orpius for multi-agent orchestration, OperationRelay calls for communication, and HMAC-based tokens for pseudonymisation.

Result: Shows feasibility of distributed reasoning with privacy-preserving architectural patterns.

Conclusion: Highlights potential for future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

*Li Zhang,Zhongxuan Han,XiaoHua Feng,Jiaming Zhang,Yuyuan Li,Linbo Jiang,Jianan Lin,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes TOFA, a training-free one-shot federated adaptation framework for Vision-Language Models, addressing communication costs and data heterogeneity by leveraging multimodal features without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated VLM adaptation methods are iterative, costly, and vulnerable to attacks, while existing one-shot methods fail to fully exploit multimodal data, handle data heterogeneity, or require extra resources.

Method: TOFA uses visual and textual pipelines: a Bayesian model for personalized visual prototypes and alignment of text prompts for robustness, combined via adaptive weight calibration.

Result: Tested on 9 datasets, TOFA effectively adapts VLMs in federated settings without training, balancing personalization and robustness.

Conclusion: TOFA offers a lightweight, efficient solution for federated VLM adaptation, overcoming key challenges in multimodal exploitation and data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

*Sen Chen,Tong Zhao,Yi Bin,Fei Ma,Wenqi Shao,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D-GARA is a dynamic benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the robustness of Android GUI agents against real-world anomalies, addressing gaps in existing static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agent benchmarks are idealized and static, lacking real-world complexity and anomalies like interruptions (e.g., permission dialogs, warnings). D-GARA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: D-GARA introduces diverse real-world anomalies and constructs a benchmark with embedded anomalies in Android apps. It evaluates GUI agents' performance in anomaly-rich environments.

Result: Experiments show significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomalies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware learning.

Conclusion: D-GARA provides a modular, extensible framework for evaluating GUI agent robustness, supporting future integration of new tasks, anomalies, and scenarios.

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

*Alexander Zadorojniy,Segev Wasserkrug,Eitan Farchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel agent-based method is introduced for validating optimization models generated by LLMs, leveraging software testing techniques to ensure correctness and requirement satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of validating optimization models generated from natural language descriptions using LLMs.

Method: Proposes an agent-based framework with three steps: generating a problem-level testing API, creating tests using this API, and producing optimization-specific mutations to evaluate test suite effectiveness.

Result: The framework demonstrates high validation quality, measured by mutation coverage, a standard in software testing.

Conclusion: The agent-based approach effectively validates optimization models, ensuring they meet the specified requirements.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

*Kangwei Xu,Grace Li Zhang,Ulf Schlichtmann,Bing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CorrectHDL uses HLS references to improve functional correctness of LLM-generated HDL designs while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often introduce errors in HDL designs due to hallucination, necessitating a corrective framework.

Method: Combines LLM-generated HDL with HLS reference designs, using RAG for syntax correction and iterative simulation for functional accuracy.

Result: Achieves better area/power efficiency than conventional HLS, nearing human-engineered quality with maintained correctness.

Conclusion: CorrectHDL effectively merges LLM generative power with traditional correctness-driven design flows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Bauplan, an agent-first lakehouse design, to address trust issues in agentic workflows by ensuring data and compute isolation, drawing parallels to MVCC in databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises distrust AI agents for production data due to unsuitable infrastructure; traditional lakehouses lack proper governance for agent access patterns.

Method: The authors introduce Bauplan, a lakehouse redesigned for agents, emphasizing transactions and governance, and demonstrate its implementation in a self-healing pipeline.

Result: Bauplan successfully integrates agent reasoning with guarantees for correctness and trust, overcoming limitations of traditional lakehouses.

Conclusion: Designing infrastructure around agent needs, like Bauplan, is key to enabling trustworthy agentic workflows in production environments.

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

*Yan Chen,Yu Zou,Jialei Zeng,Haoran You,Xiaorui Zhou,Aixi Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pharos-ESG is a framework that converts ESG reports into structured formats using multimodal parsing and hierarchical labeling, outperforming existing methods and supported by a new dataset, Aurora-ESG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG reports are challenging to analyze due to irregular layouts and unstructured content, hindering large-scale understanding and financial governance.

Method: Pharos-ESG employs multimodal parsing, contextual narration, hierarchical labeling, and reading-order modeling to structure ESG reports.

Result: The framework outperforms existing parsing systems and multimodal models, validated by annotated benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pharos-ESG and Aurora-ESG advance ESG report analysis, aiding financial governance and decision-making.

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge AI and neuroscience by investigating generative principles and ML insights for cognitive neuroscience.

Method: Examining five ML-inspired examples (world modeling, thought generation, attention, neural scaling laws, quantization) to explore their potential in neuroscience.

Result: Identifies key areas where ML research could inform and enhance understanding of neural information processing.

Conclusion: Neuroscience can significantly benefit from ML research by adopting its generative principles and insights.

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

*Joy Lai,Alex Mihailidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaDrift is a synthetic benchmark for detecting communication changes in dementia patients, simulating diverse interaction logs. It evaluates machine learning methods for detecting sentiment flattening and semantic drift, showing personalized models perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational tools lack the ability to track gradual communication changes in dementia patients, which caregivers notice informally. PersonaDrift fills this gap by providing a realistic benchmark.

Method: The benchmark simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users based on caregiver interviews, injecting progressive changes like sentiment flattening and semantic drift. Various anomaly detection and sequence models are evaluated.

Result: Simple statistical models detect sentiment flattening in low-variability users, while semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones.

Conclusion: PersonaDrift provides a valuable tool for detecting communication changes in dementia patients, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches in computational tracking.

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

*Guanchen Wu,Yuzhang Xie,Huanwei Wu,Zhe He,Hui Shao,Xiao Hu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLOZE is a zero-shot framework using LLMs to extract and integrate medical entities from clinical notes into ontologies, ensuring privacy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing ontology coverage and utility for biomedical research and clinical applications by leveraging underutilized clinical notes.

Method: CLOZE employs LLMs for automatic entity extraction and hierarchical integration into ontologies, without needing training data.

Result: CLOZE accurately extends ontologies, preserves privacy by removing PHI, and scales efficiently.

Conclusion: CLOZE offers a cost-efficient, privacy-preserving solution for ontology extension, benefiting biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

TL;DR: A taxonomical framework is developed to classify challenges to digital AI consciousness, distinguishing levels (aligned with Marr's levels) and degrees of force (from computational functionalism critiques to claims of impossibility).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguity in debates about digital consciousness by providing a structured way to classify and analyze challenges.

Method: Create a framework identifying granularity levels and degrees of force, then apply it to 14 examples from literature.

Result: The framework clarifies distinctions between challenges to computational functionalism and digital consciousness, parsing them systematically.

Conclusion: The taxonomy aids in disambiguating debates about digital consciousness without taking sides.

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

*Jules Soria,Zakaria Chihani,Julien Girard-Satabin,Alban Grastien,Romain Xu-Darme,Daniela Cancila*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses case-based reasoning networks, highlighting their interpretability but noting their explanations can be misleading. It introduces Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs) to address this, combining interpretability with formal guarantees, and tests the approach on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing case-based reasoning models provide interpretable predictions but sometimes give misleading explanations, limiting their reliability in safety-critical contexts. The paper aims to improve this by introducing formal explanations.

Method: The authors propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism leveraging latent representations to ensure predictions are properly explained. They develop a solver-free, scalable algorithm for generating ALEs and test it on standard and fine-grained image classification tasks.

Result: The approach demonstrates feasibility on diverse datasets, combining the interpretability of case-based reasoning with formal XAI guarantees.

Conclusion: ALE offers a robust solution to misleading explanations in case-based reasoning, enhancing reliability for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

### [186] [You Only Forward Once: An Efficient Compositional Judging Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16600)
*Tianlong Zhang,Hongwei Xue,Shilin Yan,Di Wu,Chen Xu,Yunyun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: YOFO is a template-conditioned MLLM method that judges structured requirements in a single forward pass, offering speed and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches for judging tasks either misalign with generative models or are too slow. YOFO addresses this by efficiently verifying structured requirements.

Method: YOFO uses a structured requirement template and produces binary decisions in one inference step by reading logits of final tokens.

Result: YOFO achieves state-of-the-art results, supports dependency-aware analysis, and benefits from post-hoc chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: YOFO provides a fast, interpretable solution for judgment tasks without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

TL;DR: DPPO introduces a metacognitive training framework to overcome data scarcity and algorithmic inefficiency in embodied intelligence, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of real-world embodied data and the inefficiency of existing methods to train versatile embodied agents.

Method: DPPO alternates dynamically between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to identify weaknesses and allocate resources efficiently.

Result: Pelican-VL 1.0, trained with DPPO, shows a 20.3% improvement over the base model and outperforms open-source models by 10.6%.

Conclusion: DPPO provides a systematic framework to alleviate data and resource bottlenecks, enabling efficient development of versatile embodied agents.

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedBayes-Lite enhances transformer-based clinical models with lightweight Bayesian methods for reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions without retraining or significant parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in clinical decision support often overconfidently predict ambiguous cases, where calibrated uncertainty is crucial.

Method: Integrates Bayesian Embedding Calibration, Uncertainty-Weighted Attention, and Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping into existing pipelines.

Result: Improves calibration and trustworthiness, reduces overconfidence by 32-48%, and prevents up to 41% of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertainty.

Conclusion: MedBayes-Lite effectively enhances uncertainty propagation and interpretability in medical AI systems.

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trading performance in high-frequency Forex by leveraging AI and comparing the predictive power of fundamental vs. technical features.

Method: Integrates macroeconomic and technical indicators (e.g., GDP, Fibonacci levels) into an AI algorithm, assessed via machine learning metrics and backtesting.

Result: Evaluated predictive accuracy and profitability, comparing fundamental and technical features' reliability for trading signals.

Conclusion: Concludes with insights on whether fundamental or technical features are more reliable for profitable Forex trading signals.

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs succeed on complex problems but fail on simpler ones, suggesting their mechanisms differ from human reasoning. The study aims to bridge cognitive science and LLM research for better model development.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements, analyzed 170K reasoning traces from 17 models and 54 humans, and meta-analyzed 1,598 LLM reasoning papers. Proposed a cognitive evaluation framework and test-time reasoning guidance.

Result: Humans use hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring, while LLMs rely on shallow forward chaining, especially on ill-structured problems. Models have successful behavioral repertoires but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Test-time guidance improves performance by up to 60%.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for developing models that reason like humans, addressing neglected meta-cognitive controls and improving LLM capabilities. It also opens new directions for testing human cognition theories at scale.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A refined resume evaluation model using a small language model and GRPO-based RL overcame traditional ATS limitations, achieving 91% accuracy and high precision/recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ATS systems are inflexible and reject qualified candidates due to minor semantic mismatches; this paper aims to improve resume evaluation with advanced ML techniques.

Method: Used Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) with a multi-component reward function. Addressed reward hacking through iterative refinement.

Result: Achieved 91% accuracy on unseen data, with high recall (0.85) and precision (1.0), demonstrating reliable candidate identification.

Conclusion: A two-step fine-tuning process effectively refines small language models for human-like candidate scoring, surpassing traditional ATS and naive RL approaches.

Abstract: Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable "gentle polishing process" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework called 3D test-time scaling to enhance reasoning in RL by integrating context, batch, and turn scaling, demonstrating improved performance across various testbeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of test-time scaling in reasoning RL, which is constrained by the context length of base models, by exploring additional dimensions like batch and turn scaling.

Method: Proposes 3D test-time scaling, combining context-length scaling, batch scaling (parallel sampling), and turn scaling (iterative self-refinement).

Result: Each scaling dimension shows bounded effectiveness, but combining them significantly boosts reasoning performance in testbeds like IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and benefits from human feedback.

Conclusion: The 3D test-time scaling framework effectively enhances reasoning RL and extends to open-ended domains like embodied learning.

Abstract: Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.

Motivation: Reward design for autonomous cyber attack-defense agents is complex; LLMs offer a solution.

Method: LLM-guided reward designs crafted with agent personas in a DRL simulation environment.

Result: LLM-designed rewards led to effective defense strategies against varied adversarial behaviors.

Conclusion: LLMs can successfully design rewards for autonomous cyber defense learning agents.

Abstract: Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.

Result: A novel heterogeneous dataset and modeling pipeline supporting ionospheric dynamics and broader Sun-Earth interactions exploration.

Conclusion: The dataset and pipeline enhance ionospheric forecasting capabilities, benefiting both scientific research and operational needs.

Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.

Result: Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show TB or not TB outperforms baselines, achieving a 77.27% improvement in code coverage.

Conclusion: Coverage-driven preference optimization is effective for LLM-based hardware verification, as demonstrated by TB or not TB’s performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in applying them to hardware design and verification. Among these stages, design verification remains the most time-consuming and resource-intensive phase, where generating effective stimuli for the design under test (DUT) is both critical and labor-intensive. We present {\it TB or not TB}, a framework for automated stimulus generation using LLMs fine-tuned through Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO). To enable preference-based training, we introduce PairaNet, a dataset derived from PyraNet that pairs high- and low-quality testbenches labeled using simulation-derived coverage metrics. The proposed CD-DPO method integrates quantitative coverage feedback directly into the optimization objective, guiding the model toward generating stimuli that maximize verification coverage. Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show that {\it TB or not TB} outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines, achieving up to 77.27\% improvement in code coverage, demonstrating the effectiveness of Coverage-driven preference optimization for LLM-based hardware verification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model Margin Noise (MM noise) for classification, a weaker assumption than Tsybakov noise, and derives improved consistency bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide enhanced consistency bounds under a less restrictive noise condition than Tsybakov noise.

Method: Introduces MM noise, analyzes its properties, and derives consistency bounds for binary and multi-class classification.

Result: Improved consistency bounds under MM noise, extending previous results with favorable exponents.

Conclusion: MM noise offers a flexible framework for analyzing classification noise, yielding better consistency bounds.

Abstract: We introduce a new low-noise condition for classification, the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, and derive enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds under this condition. MM noise is weaker than Tsybakov noise condition: it is implied by Tsybakov noise condition but can hold even when Tsybakov fails, because it depends on the discrepancy between a given hypothesis and the Bayes-classifier rather than on the intrinsic distributional minimal margin (see Figure 1 for an illustration of an explicit example). This hypothesis-dependent assumption yields enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification. Our results extend the enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds of Mao, Mohri, and Zhong (2025a) with the same favorable exponents but under a weaker assumption than the Tsybakov noise condition; they interpolate smoothly between linear and square-root regimes for intermediate noise levels. We also instantiate these bounds for common surrogate loss families and provide illustrative tables.

TL;DR: AFOCP improves standard OCP by using feature-space calibration and attention-based weighting, achieving smaller prediction intervals while maintaining coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard OCP lacks efficiency due to simple NC scores and uniform historical treatment, limiting adaptability to non-stationarity and distribution shifts.

Method: AFOCP leverages feature spaces of pre-trained networks and an attention mechanism for adaptive historical weighting.

Result: AFOCP reduces prediction intervals by up to 88% compared to OCP, maintaining coverage levels.

Conclusion: AFOCP's innovations in feature-space calibration and adaptive weighting enhance prediction efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.

Motivation: Existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, hindering clinical adoption for ICU mortality prediction.

Method: A logistic regression model fuses predictions from a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes, ensuring interpretability.

Result: The ensemble outperforms single models (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) and remains robust with missing data.

Conclusion: The system provides competitive, interpretable, and reliable risk estimates, crucial for clinical use.

Abstract: Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.

TL;DR: GLOBE is a neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs integrating boundary-element methods and equivariant ML, achieving significant accuracy improvements and practical advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that combines physics-inspired inductive biases with ML to improve accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for industrial CAE.

Method: GLOBE represents solutions using learnable Green's-function-like kernels, composed across multiscale branches and hyperlayers. It ensures equivariance, discretization-invariance, and units-invariance.

Result: On AirFRANS, GLOBE reduces errors by 200x compared to baselines and 50x vs. the next-best model. It performs well even in scarce-data scenarios and handles non-watertight meshes.

Conclusion: GLOBE demonstrates that physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases lead to significant gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates.

Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decoding efficiency and acceptance rates in speculative sampling by addressing the computational complexity of the optimal transport problem in multi-draft scenarios.

Method: Reformulates the optimal transport linear program (OTLP) as a max-flow problem and reduces it to a convex optimization problem using polymatroid theory, enabling an efficient algorithm.

Result: Achieves 90% acceptance rates with under 100 ms overhead per token and negligible deviation from the target model distribution.

Conclusion: The paper presents a practical solution for multi-draft speculative sampling, balancing computational feasibility and high acceptance rates.

Abstract: Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.

TL;DR: FuncBind is a framework for generating target-conditioned, all-atom molecules using computer vision techniques and neural fields, achieving competitive performance across diverse atomic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for structure-based drug design are limited to specific modalities, restricting their broader applicability.

Method: FuncBind uses neural fields for molecule representation and score-based generative models with architectures from computer vision to handle diverse atomic systems.

Result: FuncBind performs well in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody loops, and successfully redesigns antibody binders in vitro.

Conclusion: FuncBind offers a modality-agnostic solution for structure-based drug design and introduces a new benchmark for macrocyclic peptide generation.

Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in Transformer-based diffusion models due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead.

Method: Uses a bidirectional Mamba backbone for linear-time sequence modeling and introduces a hybrid variant (DiffuApriel-H) combining attention and Mamba layers.

Result: Achieves up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with similar performance to Transformer-based models.

Conclusion: Bidirectional state-space architectures provide a scalable and efficient foundation for diffusion-based language models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.

TL;DR: iLTM introduces an integrated model combining tree embeddings, hypernetworks, and MLPs to outperform GBDTs and deep tabular models with minimal tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite deep learning advances, GBDTs remain dominant in tabular data tasks, highlighting the need for a more adaptable and robust solution.

Method: iLTM unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, MLPs, and retrieval in one architecture, pretrained on 1,800+ datasets.

Result: iLTM consistently outperforms GBDTs and deep tabular models in classification and regression tasks, even after light fine-tuning.

Conclusion: iLTM bridges tree-based and neural methods, offering a scalable and adaptable framework for tabular foundation models.

Abstract: Tabular data underpins decisions across science, industry, and public services. Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study used SEIRV-based ML predictions for WSN virus threats. Synthetic datasets were tested with various ML algorithms, revealing Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors as top performers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of epidemiological data in WSNs to forecast and mitigate malware threats by leveraging ML techniques.

Method: Agent-based SEIRV model implemented with tools like NetLogo and Python, generating synthetic datasets for regression-based ML predictions.

Result: ML algorithms achieved high R^2 values (up to 1.000) on training sets, with Random Forest and others outperforming linear models.

Conclusion: ML models, especially ensemble methods, effectively predict malware spread in WSNs, offering robust forecasting tools.

Abstract: The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes stochastic variants of Descent-to-Delete (D2D) and Rewind-to-Delete (R2D) algorithms for machine unlearning, proving (ε, δ) guarantees for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical backing for stochastic D2D and R2D algorithms in machine unlearning, addressing their effectiveness across different types of loss functions.

Method: The authors analyze unlearning through disturbed or biased gradient systems and use probabilistic sensitivity bounds coupled with a relaxed Gaussian mechanism.

Result: D2D offers tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions, while R2D works for convex and nonconvex settings by reversing accumulated disturbances.

Conclusion: The study provides certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic D2D and R2D, highlighting their respective strengths depending on the loss function type.

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.

*Yiling Liu,Juncheng Dong,Chen Fu,Wei Shi,Ziyang Jiang,Zhigang Hua,David Carlson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM) to improve counterfactual outcome estimation in time-series data by enhancing deconfounding and temporal generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual outcome estimation is vital for decision-making but challenging due to unobserved trajectories and evolving confounders.

Method: The framework integrates SGA for fine-grained sub-treatment group alignment and RTM for temporal generalization by masking covariates with noise.

Result: Empirical results show SGA and RTM individually improve estimation, but their combination achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The synergy of SGA (deconfounding) and RTM (temporal generalization) offers robust and accurate counterfactual outcome estimation.

Abstract: Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.

### [209] [CARE: Turning LLMs Into Causal Reasoning Expert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16016)
*Juncheng Dong,Yiling Liu,Ahmed Aloui,Vahid Tarokh,David Carlson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with causal discovery, relying on semantics over data. CARE framework improves LLMs' causal reasoning by fine-tuning them to use outputs from causal-discovery algorithms, outperforming larger models and traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' impressive reasoning abilities, they lack causal discovery skills, a key aspect of human intelligence. This study aims to bridge that gap.

Method: The authors first analyze LLMs' failure in causal discovery, then propose CARE, a framework that fine-tunes LLMs to use outputs from causal-discovery algorithms effectively.

Result: CARE-finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B outperforms traditional algorithms and larger LLMs, showing improved causal reasoning.

Conclusion: CARE enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning abilities, demonstrating potential for integrating LLMs with traditional algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.

TL;DR: HGCN2SP is a novel hierarchical graph model for accelerating Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) problems by efficiently selecting scenarios in order, leveraging reinforcement learning and hierarchical graph convolutional networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving 2SP problems struggle with many scenarios due to shallow information integration and ignored scenario order impact.

Method: HGCN2SP uses a hierarchical graph to encode scenarios and model their relationships, trained via reinforcement learning with a policy network featuring hierarchical graph convolutional networks and an attention-based decoder.

Result: HGCN2SP delivers high-quality decisions quickly and generalizes well to large-scale, unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: HGCN2SP effectively addresses the limitations of current methods, offering efficient and scalable solutions for 2SP problems.

Abstract: Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents rely on human data, limiting scalability. Self-evolution frameworks are restricted by model capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering complex curricula.

Method: Agent0 uses multi-step co-evolution between a curriculum agent (proposing tasks) and an executor agent (solving tasks), integrating tools for enhanced problem-solving.

Result: Agent0 improves the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on math reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Agent0 enables autonomous, scalable agent evolution, advancing reasoning capabilities beyond human-curated data limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

### [212] [Change-of-Basis Pruning via Rotational Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16061)
*Alex Ning,Vainateya Rangaraju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces rotationally invariant activations (TSRAs) for change-of-basis pruning, enabling compatibility with deep learning architectures without extra parameters. While CoB+TSRA shows promise, it slightly sacrifices accuracy but improves pruning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of structured pruning depends on importance distribution in representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning aims to concentrate importance but lacks compatibility with standard architectures.

Method: Introduces two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs), invariant to orthogonal transformations, allowing CoB to merge into weights without extra parameters.

Result: CoB+TSRA improves structured pruning accuracy and extends the reliable pruning frontier (30% to 70%). Threshold-based pruning achieves 90-96% pruning with minimal accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Rotationally invariant designs like TSRA offer a principled path for CoB pruning, despite slight accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle with heterophilous graphs due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals.

Method: GESC replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism, using a U(1) phase connection and rank-1 projection to attenuate self-parallel components.

Result: GESC consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models across diverse graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method offers a unified, interference-aware view of message passing, addressing limitations of traditional GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing.

TL;DR: ILoRA addresses challenges in federated learning with LoRA by introducing QR-based initialization, concatenated QR aggregation, and AdamW optimizer with rank-aware controls, improving accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle initialization-induced instability, rank incompatibility, and client drift in federated learning with LoRA under client heterogeneity.

Method: ILoRA uses QR-based orthonormal initialization, concatenated QR aggregation for heterogeneous-rank updates, and AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates.

Result: Experiments show ILoRA outperforms existing federated LoRA methods in accuracy and convergence stability.

Conclusion: ILoRA provides a unified solution to federated LoRA challenges, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical success.

Abstract: Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.

### [215] [L-JacobiNet and S-JacobiNet: An Analysis of Adaptive Generalization, Stabilization, and Spectral Domain Trade-offs in GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16081)
*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filters (AOPFs) to address limitations of Spectral GNNs like ChebyNet, specifically heterophily and over-smoothing. It compares two models, `L-JacobiNet` and `S-JacobiNet`, revealing domain-specific trade-offs and highlighting stabilization as ChebyNet's main flaw.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Spectral GNNs suffer from heterophily and over-smoothing due to static, low-pass filters. The study explores AOPFs as a solution, focusing on adaptive and stabilized variants to improve performance and stability.

Method: Two models are proposed: `L-JacobiNet` (adaptive generalization of ChebyNet) and `S-JacobiNet` (stabilized static ChebyNet). Their performance is compared against AOPFs like `LaguerreNet` across different domains ([-1, 1] and [0, infty)).

Result: The [0, infty) domain excels in modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain offers better numerical stability for high K. Surprisingly, stabilization (not adaptation) is ChebyNet's main flaw, with `S-JacobiNet` outperforming `L-JacobiNet` on most benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study identifies `S-JacobiNet` as a robust baseline, suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain may cause overfitting. Stabilization, rather than adaptation, is key to improving Spectral GNN performance.

Abstract: Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the "Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.

### [216] [AssayMatch: Learning to Select Data for Molecular Activity Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16087)
*Vincent Fan,Regina Barzilay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AssayMatch is a framework for selecting homogeneous training data in drug discovery, improving model performance by filtering noisy experiments using data attribution and finetuned embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in drug discovery suffer from noisy training data due to aggregated, inconsistent sources like ChEMBL. AssayMatch aims to address this by selecting better-suited training data.

Method: AssayMatch uses data attribution to quantify training assay contributions and finetunes text-based assay embeddings for compatibility. It ranks training data for selection, even with unknown test labels.

Result: Models trained with AssayMatch-selected data outperform those using full datasets, showing improved prediction in 9/12 model-target pairs. Noise reduction enhances predictive power.

Conclusion: AssayMatch effectively curates higher-quality datasets, boosting data efficiency and model performance in drug discovery by eliminating incompatible experiments.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

*Haohui Chen,Zhiyong Chen,Aoxiang Liu,Wentuo Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces enhanced methods within a double actor-critic framework to address value estimation biases in deterministic policy gradient algorithms, proposing convex combination strategies for flexible bias control and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the performance degradation caused by value estimation biases in deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control, and the underexplored potential of double actors.

Method: The method involves a double actor-critic framework with temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), introducing three convex combination strategies (symmetric and asymmetric) for bias control and integrating augmented state and action representations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent outperformance of benchmarks, highlighting the benefits of tunable bias control and exploitation of overestimation and underestimation.

Conclusion: The work underscores the effectiveness of flexible bias control and representation learning in improving deterministic policy gradient algorithms, with potential applicability varying by environment.

Abstract: Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.

### [218] [HybSpecNet: A Critical Analysis of Architectural Instability in Hybrid-Domain Spectral GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16101)
*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HybSpecNet resolves the stability-vs-adaptivity trade-off in spectral GNNs by combining stable ChebyNet and adaptive KrawtchoukNet branches, addressing instability poisoning with late fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the trade-off between stability and adaptivity in spectral GNNs, where existing methods either lack adaptability or suffer from instability.

Method: Proposes HybSpecNet, a hybrid-domain GNN combining ChebyNet (stable) and KrawtchoukNet (adaptive) branches, with late fusion to isolate gradients.

Result: The naive hybrid fails due to instability poisoning, but the advanced architecture remains stable up to K=30 and achieves SOTA performance.

Conclusion: HybSpecNet successfully resolves the trade-off, providing a robust solution for spectral GNN design.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.

*Yuanbo Tang,Yan Tang,Zixuan Zhang,Zihui Zhao,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust and interpretable deep generative model for trajectory generation using pathlet representation, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robustness and interpretability in existing deep learning models for trajectory generation, especially for noisy real-world data.

Method: A deep generative model based on pathlet representation, combining a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a linear decoder to learn latent embeddings and a trajectory segment dictionary.

Result: Achieves relative improvements of 35.4% and 26.3% over baselines, saves 64.8% time and 56.5% GPU memory, and supports downstream tasks like prediction and denoising.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances robustness, interpretability, and efficiency for trajectory generation, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.
  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an SHAP-guided framework for generating synthetic emotion data using LLMs, matching real-data performance and improving underrepresented class classification, while noting synthetic text's linguistic limitations compared to authentic posts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and restrictions in accessing real social media data for emotion recognition necessitate synthetic data generation.

Method: Uses SHAP explanations to guide LLM-based synthetic data generation, leveraging seed data to enhance performance.

Result: SHAP-guided synthetic data matches real-data performance, outperforms naïve generation, and improves underrepresented class classification. Synthetic texts, however, show less vocabulary richness and temporal/personal complexity.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical synthetic data generation but highlights trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity, crucial for trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from social media is critical for understanding public sentiment, but accessing training data has become prohibitively expensive due to escalating API costs and platform restrictions. We introduce an interpretability-guided framework where Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide principled guidance for LLM-based synthetic data generation. With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts. This work provides both a practical framework for responsible synthetic data generation and a critical perspective on its limitations, underscoring that the future of trustworthy AI depends on navigating the trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.

*Zhijie Zhong,Zhiwen Yu,Kaixiang Yang,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAND, a simple supervised baseline for TSAD, outperforms complex unsupervised methods by leveraging limited labels, advocating a data-centric approach over algorithmic complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the overlooked potential of limited anomaly labels in TSAD, challenging the focus on architectural complexity in unsupervised methods.

Method: STAND is introduced as a streamlined supervised baseline. The study compares supervised and unsupervised paradigms systematically.

Result: Simple supervised models outperform complex unsupervised ones under limited labels. Supervision yields higher performance gains than architectural innovations. STAND excels in prediction consistency and anomaly localization.

Conclusion: The findings advocate prioritizing label utilization over algorithmic complexity in TSAD research.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for NPPs to adapt to renewable energy growth drives the development of better MPC methods.

Method: Proposes two surrogate models based on nonlinear stiff ODEs for enhanced simulation.

Result: Both models significantly reduce computational time (up to 1000x faster).

Conclusion: Data-driven and physics-informed models effectively integrate complex dynamics for quicker simulations.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing need for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) to improve flexibility in order to match the rapid growth of renewable energies. The Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) developed by Framatome addresses this problem through Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate wind power forecasts are essential for grid stability, supply-demand balance, and market risk management, especially for longer prediction horizons.

Method: The study introduces a framework to convert ECMWF weather forecasts into wind power predictions, including post-processing to address biases and dispersion issues.

Result: The method outperforms climatological baselines by 50% in skill scores and achieves near-perfect calibration for lead times of 15 to 46 days.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively bridges the gap between subseasonal weather forecasts and wind power predictions, offering significant improvements for extended horizons.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts. We show that our method is able to outperform a climatological baseline by 50 % in terms of both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Ensemble Mean Squared Error while also providing near perfect calibration of the forecasts for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rumor detection models lack interpretability and fail to capture causal mechanisms of misinformation spread.

Method: Combines Mamba-based sequence modeling, GCNs, and differentiable causal discovery (NOTEARS) to learn temporal tweet sequences and reply structures while uncovering causal graphs.

Result: Achieves competitive classification on Twitter15 and enables counterfactual intervention analysis, revealing influential nodes.

Conclusion: Provides a unified, explainable framework for rumor detection and influence analysis, advancing actionable misinformation detection.

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media remains a challenging task due to the complex propagation dynamics and the limited interpretability of existing models. While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve algorithm performance using predictions while ensuring robustness against errors.

Method: Develops SemiTrust-and-Switch framework combining prediction-based and classical algorithms.

Result: Provides tight bounds and designs a smooth randomized algorithm.

Conclusion: The framework and algorithms achieve balanced performance and graceful degradation with prediction quality.

Abstract: We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.
  Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.
  We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.

TL;DR: A specialised Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) method using Causal Generative Models (CGMs) is proposed to address poor data quality and fairness issues in recruitment ranking algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets in recruitment are scarce due to sensitive information, hindering fair ML model development. CGMs offer controlled synthetic data generation to improve fairness and interpretability.

Method: Two CGMs model job offers and curricula using causal graphs. Synthetic datasets are generated and evaluated for fairness under controlled biased scenarios.

Result: The method enables generation of synthetic data preserving causal relationships, aiding fairness assessment in ranking algorithms.

Conclusion: CGMs provide a promising solution for SDG in recruitment, enhancing fairness and reliability of ML models.

Abstract: The importance of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) has increased significantly in domains where data quality is poor or access is limited due to privacy and regulatory constraints. One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. %
This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %
Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %
In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.

TL;DR: The paper explores using diffusion models (DMs) to address data scarcity in nuclear energy by generating synthetic CHF data, showing success in realism and physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications by leveraging deep generative models to enrich training datasets.

Method: Developed vanilla and conditional DMs to generate synthetic CHF data, evaluated their performance on feature distributions, correlations, and physical consistency.

Result: Both DMs produced realistic, physics-consistent CHF data; conditional DM excelled in targeted data generation with acceptable uncertainty.

Conclusion: DMs, especially conditional ones, are effective for augmenting CHF datasets, addressing data scarcity while maintaining reliability.

Abstract: Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.

TL;DR: Proposes Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA) to address class imbalance in crop-type classification by simulating skewed label distributions during training, improving real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in agricultural datasets and the mismatch between artificially balanced training sets and real-world conditions degrade model performance.

Method: Introduces DirPA, modeling real-world label distributions as Dirichlet-distributed random variables to simulate skew during few-shot learning.

Result: DirPA shifts decision boundaries and stabilizes training by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

Conclusion: DirPA effectively addresses label distribution mismatch, enhancing generalization in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges posed by uncertain communication delays in connected cyber-physical systems during real-time inference.

Method: Employing adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to delay patterns, eliminating the need for reference-modality reliance.

Result: Achieves robust real-time inference with better control over accuracy-latency tradeoff, outperforming SotA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows superior adaptability to network dynamics, validated on audio-visual event localization tasks.

Abstract: Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Q-learning methods for zero-sum games are limited to tabular cases and lack applicability in high-dimensional settings with function approximation.

Method: Develops a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm using neural networks for function approximation.

Result: Proves finite-time convergence and demonstrates effectiveness through numerical experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm outperforms existing Q-learning methods in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the pass@k metric used for evaluating LLMs' reasoning, revealing its limitations as an optimization objective and suggesting better alternatives for reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness of the pass@k metric for optimizing multi-step reasoning in LLMs and identify its shortcomings.

Method: The authors analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and compare it to pass@1, highlighting its vanishing learning signal in critical exploration regimes.

Result: The pass@k objective becomes ineffective as exploration collapses, and the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes when the policy concentrates probability mass.

Conclusion: Pass@k is useful diagnostically but unsuitable for direct optimization; explicit exploration mechanisms are recommended instead.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GeoPTH demonstrates that a prototype-centric approach provides a practical, high-performance alternative for efficient trajectory retrieval.

Abstract: Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{T}rajectory \textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.

### [233] [Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16287)
*David Bechtoldt,Sidney Bender*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework called Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation uses discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance to generate counterfactual explanations for graph data, addressing challenges due to its discrete and non-euclidean nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning models on graph data lack interpretability, making it hard to understand predictions. Counterfactual explanations are underexplored for graphs due to their complexity.

Method: The framework combines discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance to generate counterfactual explanations for graph data.

Result: The method reliably produces in-distribution and minimally altered counterfactuals for both discrete and continuous graph properties.

Conclusion: This approach successfully addresses the challenge of generating interpretable explanations for graph-based models.

Abstract: Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.

*Dean Brandner,Sergio Lucia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL-based method optimizes chemical process operation recipes using expert knowledge, reducing data needs and handling constraints better than traditional RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal chemical process operation is crucial for efficiency, but traditional RL and control methods face data and complexity challenges.

Method: Proposes optimizing operation recipes and linear controllers with RL, leveraging expert knowledge for efficiency and interpretability.

Result: Simulation on an industrial batch reactor shows near-optimal performance with reduced data and better constraint handling.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, interpretable solution for optimal chemical process operation, outperforming traditional RL and control approaches.

Abstract: Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for uncertain linear time-invariant systems, improving state estimation accuracy by refining system matrices via gradient-based optimization, reducing errors by over 15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertain dynamics in linear time-invariant systems by enhancing traditional observer designs with learning mechanisms for more accurate state estimation.

Method: Treats system matrices as optimizable variables, refining them through gradient-based minimization of output discrepancy loss, creating a data-informed surrogate model.

Result: Monte Carlo studies show systematic error reductions exceeding 15% for both open-loop and Luenberger observers.

Conclusion: Learning mechanisms complement traditional observer designs, improving accuracy and robustness in uncertain systems.

Abstract: This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews World Models in healthcare, highlighting their potential for predictive, reliable, and data-efficient AI in clinical decision support. It surveys applications in medical imaging, disease progression, and robotic surgery, and proposes a capability rubric (L1-L4) to evaluate progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare AI needs predictive, reliable, and efficient models. Current generative models lack physical and temporal grounding, making World Models a promising alternative for clinical decision support.

Method: The paper surveys World Models across three domains: medical imaging/diagnostics, disease progression modeling, and robotic surgery. It introduces a rubric (L1-L4) to assess capabilities like prediction, action-conditioning, counterfactuals, and planning.

Result: Most systems achieve basic prediction (L1-L2), with fewer reaching counterfactual evaluation (L3) or planning (L4). Gaps include weak validation, incomplete state construction, and safety issues.

Conclusion: The review calls for research to integrate generative models with causal/mechanical foundations for robust, safe decision support in healthcare.

Abstract: Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve GP scalability by leveraging solutions from smaller systems to speed up iterative solver convergence for large linear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Gaussian process scalability is crucial for sequential decision-making tasks, but it remains challenging.

Method: Uses iterative linear solvers (e.g., conjugate gradients) and leverages solutions from smaller systems to enhance convergence.

Result: Demonstrates speed-ups in solving large systems to tolerance and improved Bayesian optimisation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances GP scalability, especially for incremental data tasks.

Abstract: Scalable Gaussian process (GP) inference is essential for sequential decision-making tasks, yet improving GP scalability remains a challenging problem with many open avenues of research. This paper focuses on iterative GPs, where iterative linear solvers, such as conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent or alternative projections, are used to approximate the GP posterior. We propose a new method which improves solver convergence of a large linear system by leveraging the known solution to a smaller system contained within. This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.

TL;DR: Foundation models like Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN were evaluated for corporate bankruptcy prediction but underperformed compared to classical ML methods like XGBoost and CatBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess the effectiveness of foundation models against traditional methods for bankruptcy prediction.

Method: Used large, imbalanced datasets from the Visegrád Group and compared Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN with classical ML baselines.

Result: XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperformed foundation models; LLMs had unreliable probability estimates, and TabPFN's performance did not justify its computational cost.

Conclusion: Current foundation models are less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise across various financial applications, yet their effectiveness for corporate bankruptcy prediction remains systematically unevaluated against established methods. We study bankruptcy forecasting using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, evaluated on large, highly imbalanced datasets of over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains. These findings suggest that, despite their generality, current foundation models remain less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores designing optimal local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms to reduce data unfairness and improve fairness in classification, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness in downstream classification by reducing data unfairness through optimally designed LDP mechanisms.

Method: Derives closed-form optimal mechanisms for binary attributes and develops a tractable optimization framework for multi-valued attributes.

Result: Reducing data unfairness lowers classification unfairness; the approach outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in fairness and maintains accuracy.

Conclusion: LDP is a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.

Abstract: We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADH-MTL, a method combining wearable sensors and multi-task learning to jointly assess physical diseases and depression, addressing heterogeneity challenges and outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical diseases, ignoring comorbid depression. Joint assessment is needed for better chronic care management.

Method: The proposed ADH-MTL method includes group-level modeling, a decomposition strategy, and a Bayesian network to handle disease and patient heterogeneity.

Result: ADH-MTL outperforms baselines in real-world wearable sensor data evaluations, proving effective for integrated healthcare.

Conclusion: ADH-MTL advances collaborative chronic disease management by offering a computational solution for joint physical and mental health assessment.

Abstract: Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.

*Seyed Mohamad Moghadas,Bruno Cornelis,Adrian Munteanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreqFlow is a novel framework for multivariate time-series forecasting using frequency-domain conditional flow matching, offering significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy over diffusion-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for MTS forecasting suffer from computational overhead and brittleness with high-dimensional, non-stationary data. FreqFlow aims to address these limitations.

Method: FreqFlow transforms forecasting into the spectral domain, modeling amplitude and phase shifts via a complex-valued linear layer and decomposes signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components for flow matching.

Result: FreqFlow achieves 7% RMSE improvements on real-world datasets, is faster, and has only 89k parameters, making it more efficient than diffusion-based models.

Conclusion: FreqFlow offers a lightweight, deterministic, and efficient solution for MTS forecasting, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative modeling framework using latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to handle irregularly sampled clinical time series data, outperforming baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical time series data is valuable but challenging due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and uncertainties. The paper aims to address these challenges for better medical decision-making.

Method: The framework uses neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models and variational inference for state estimation and parameter learning, handling irregular sampling and stochasticity.

Result: The framework outperforms ODE and LSTM baselines in accuracy and uncertainty estimation on simulated PKPD models and real-world ICU data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows promise for precise, uncertainty-aware clinical predictions, supporting better medical decision-making.

Abstract: Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparative study of Decision Transformer (DT) vs. traditional offline RL methods (CQL, IQL) in ANT environment; DT excels in sparse rewards and mixed data, while value-based methods perform better in dense rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how DT and traditional offline RL algorithms perform in varying reward densities (sparse vs. dense) in the ANT environment, identifying strengths and trade-offs for each method.

Method: Comparative empirical analysis of DT, CQL, and IQL in ANT continuous control tasks, testing performance across different reward structures and dataset qualities (e.g., medium-expert data).

Result: DT showed robustness to varying reward density, performing well in sparse rewards with mixed-quality data. Value-based methods (IQL, CQL) excelled in dense rewards or high-quality datasets. DT had lower variance but higher computational costs.

Conclusion: Sequence modelling (DT) suits uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods are better for dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.

Abstract: The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates MORL algorithms, highlighting limitations of scalarisation functions in approximating Pareto fronts and proposes inner-loop multi-policy algorithms as a better alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the limitations of scalarisation functions in MORL algorithms for decision-making in complex environments.

Method: Examined MO Q-Learning with linear and Chebyshev scalarisation, and Pareto Q-Learning in MORL environments with discrete spaces.

Result: Scalarisation functions struggle with Pareto front approximation and weight configuration, while inner-loop multi-policy algorithms show promise.

Conclusion: Inner-loop multi-policy algorithms outperform scalarisation-based methods in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Abstract: Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI models lack transparency due to complexity, high computational costs, and instability under correlated inputs, necessitating scalable and efficient explainability methods.

Method: ExCIR uses correlation-aware attribution scores with robust centering. BlockCIR extends this to groupwise attribution, mitigating double-counting in collinear clusters.

Result: ExCIR shows agreement with baselines, consistent rankings, and reduced runtime across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: ExCIR provides computationally efficient, consistent, and scalable explainability suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models require heavy resources and lack interpretability; ODE-ViT addresses this by leveraging ODEs for stability and efficiency.

Method: Reformulate Vision Transformer as an ODE system, integrate a teacher-student framework to guide training via intermediate representations.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, outperforming prior ODE-based Transformers, and gains over 10% with teacher-student guidance.

Conclusion: ODE-ViT offers a stable, interpretable, and efficient alternative to large models, with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting label errors in training data without fitting to erroneous labels.

Method: Introduces two novel loss functions that de-weight or ignore difficult samples (likely label errors), inspired by Focal Loss.

Result: Shows improved F1 scores for detecting label errors compared to conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss on corrupted data.

Conclusion: The proposed loss functions effectively improve label error detection by handling difficult samples better than existing methods.

Abstract: Methods for detecting label errors in training data require models that are robust to label errors (i.e., not fit to erroneously labelled data points). However, acquiring such models often involves training on corrupted data, which presents a challenge. Adjustments to the loss function present an opportunity for improvement. Motivated by Focal Loss (which emphasizes difficult-to-classify samples), two novel, yet simple, loss functions are proposed that de-weight or ignore these difficult samples (i.e., those likely to have label errors). Results on artificially corrupted data show promise, such that F1 scores for detecting errors are improved from the baselines of conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss.

Motivation: To unlock the potential of foundation flow-matching models in solving inverse problems, which currently lag behind domain-specific or untrained priors.

Method: Introduce FMPlug, a framework combining instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization to preserve Gaussian structures while adding problem-specific guidance.

Result: Significant performance improvement in image restoration and scientific inverse problems.

Conclusion: FMPlug demonstrates how foundation flow-matching models can become practical, reusable priors for solving inverse problems.

Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for benchmarking FL under dynamic client participation and proposes KPFL to mitigate performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL research overlooks dynamic client participation, lacking systematic benchmarking for such scenarios.

Method: The authors develop a configurable framework for DPFL and propose KPFL, a plugin using dual-age weighting and generative knowledge distillation.

Result: Benchmarking reveals performance drops in FL models under dynamic participation; KPFL improves robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: Dynamic participation significantly impacts FL, and KPFL effectively addresses related challenges.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.

*Yuanbo Guo,Jun Xia,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairLRF, a fairness-oriented low rank factorization framework using SVD to enhance DL model fairness without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring fairness in DL models is crucial, especially in sensitive fields like medical diagnosis, but existing methods are often computationally expensive or reduce accuracy.

Method: FairLRF uses SVD to identify and remove bias-inducing elements in unitary matrices, reducing group disparities.

Result: FairLRF outperforms traditional LRF and state-of-the-art fairness techniques.

Conclusion: This is the first work repurposing SVD primarily for fairness enhancement rather than compression.

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.

*Han Su,Zhongyan Li,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the sensitivity of universal approximation in randomized learning networks by proposing BSCRLS, a method with adaptive random parameter constraints, proving its norm convergence and testing its superiority empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The universal approximation property in randomized learning networks often relies on probabilistic convergence, making it sensitive to random parameter selection. This limitation in models like BRLS motivates the development of a more robust solution.

Method: The authors propose BSCRLS, a novel algorithm incorporating an adaptive supervisory mechanism to constrain random parameters within BRLS. They prove its universal approximation with norm convergence and offer three incremental versions for diverse applications.

Result: Experiments on solar panel dust detection show BSCRLS outperforms 13 deep and broad learning algorithms, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: BSCRLS successfully addresses the convergence limitation in randomized learning networks, demonstrating theoretical robustness and practical superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms.

*Perrine Chassat,Van Tuan Nguyen,Lucas Ducrot,Emilie Lanoy,Agathe Guilloux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative AI, specifically a VAE, is proposed to create synthetic control arms for clinical trials, addressing challenges like censoring and small sample sizes in survival data. It outperforms GANs in fidelity, utility, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials suffer from fragmented populations, slow enrollment, and high costs, especially in oncology and rare diseases. Existing solutions like real-world data controls are limited.

Method: A VAE jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes without independent censoring assumptions. Tested in synthetic and real datasets for privacy-constrained data sharing and control-arm augmentation.

Result: Outperforms GAN baselines in fidelity, utility, and privacy. Reveals issues with type I error and power calibration, addressed by a post-generation selection procedure.

Conclusion: The VAE approach shows promise for synthetic control arms but highlights ongoing challenges in generative survival modeling.

Abstract: Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.

*Fares Fourati,Mohamed-Slim Alouini,Vaneet Aggarwal*

TL;DR: ECPv2 is an improved algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown constants, addressing ECP's limitations through adaptive bounds, memory mechanisms, and random projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior of the ECP framework.

Method: ECPv2 introduces three innovations: adaptive lower bounds, a Worst-m memory mechanism, and fixed random projections.

Result: ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees, expands acceptance regions, and outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers while reducing computation time.

Conclusion: ECPv2 is a scalable, theoretically grounded algorithm validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.

*Amartya Mukherjee,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD achieves almost sure convergence under smoothness assumptions, extending to momentum variants like DP-SHB and DP-NAG, strengthening theoretical foundations for private optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the long-run behavior of DP-SGD, particularly its almost sure convergence, which existing analyses lack.

Method: Analyzing DP-SGD under standard smoothness assumptions, including nonconvex and strongly convex settings, with decaying step sizes. Extends to momentum variants using careful energy constructions.

Result: Proves almost sure convergence for DP-SGD and its variants (DP-SHB, DP-NAG), demonstrating pathwise stability despite privacy-induced distortions.

Conclusion: The findings provide stronger theoretical guarantees for differentially private optimization, confirming the algorithm's stability in various settings.

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.

*Zohar Rimon,Elisei Shafer,Tal Tepper,Efrat Shimron,Aviv Tamar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised learning method for artificial palpation, using an encoder-decoder framework to learn tactile representations for tasks like imaging and change detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current palpation methods rely heavily on human touch, limiting scalability and consistency. The study aims to automate palpation using tactile data for more objective and detailed medical examinations.

Method: An encoder-decoder framework learns tactile representations from robot-collected palpation sequences. Training involves simulated and real-world datasets (MRI-ground truth pairs).

Result: The learned representation captures intricate tactile patterns beyond force maps, enabling successful predictions for sensory readings and applications in imaging and change detection.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning can effectively automate palpation, offering potential advancements in medical diagnostics through tactile data analysis.

Abstract: Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.

*Shihab Ahmed,El Houcine Bergou,Aritra Dutta,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A universal reward profiling framework enhances policy gradient methods by selectively updating policies based on high-confidence performance estimations, improving reliability and convergence speed without slowing baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy gradient methods often suffer from high variance in gradient estimations, leading to unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The proposed framework integrates reward profiling with policy gradient algorithms, selectively updating policies using high-confidence performance estimations.

Result: Empirical tests on continuous-control benchmarks show up to 1.5x faster convergence and 1.75x reduction in return variance.

Conclusion: The reward profiling framework provides a general, theoretically grounded solution for more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

TL;DR: EGGROLL is a scalable evolution strategies algorithm using low-rank learning to optimize large neural networks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive computational and memory costs of naive ES at scale for large neural networks.

Method: EGGROLL employs low-rank matrix perturbations (A B^T) instead of full-rank perturbations (E), reducing storage and computation costs.

Result: EGGROLL maintains ES performance, competes with GRPO in LLM reasoning, and enables stable integer-based language model pre-training.

Conclusion: EGGROLL offers a scalable, efficient alternative to full-rank ES without compromising performance.

Abstract: We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.

TL;DR: TLT accelerates RL training for reasoning LLMs using adaptive speculative decoding, overcoming efficiency bottlenecks without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training reasoning LLMs with RL suffers from inefficiency due to long-tail response generation, wasting resources and increasing costs.

Method: TLT integrates adaptive speculative decoding with two components: Adaptive Drafter (trains a lightweight draft model during idle GPU time) and Adaptive Rollout Engine (manages efficient CUDAGraphs and selects decoding strategies).

Result: TLT achieves over 1.7x speedup in RL training compared to state-of-the-art systems while maintaining model accuracy and producing a deployable draft model.

Conclusion: TLT offers a lossless, efficient solution for RL training of reasoning LLMs, addressing inefficiencies and resource wastage.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.
