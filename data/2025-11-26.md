### [2] [Personalized Reward Modeling for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19458)
*Jeongeun Lee,Ryang Heo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIGReward is a personalized reward model for evaluating text-to-image (T2I) generation, addressing the limitations of conventional methods by using CoT reasoning and self-bootstrapping to capture individual preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I evaluation methods struggle to align with diverse user preferences, necessitating a personalized approach.

Method: PIGReward dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and employs CoT reasoning. It uses a self-bootstrapping strategy to construct user contexts from limited data.

Result: PIGReward outperforms existing methods in accuracy and interpretability, offering personalized feedback for prompt optimization.

Conclusion: PIGReward provides a scalable and reasoning-based solution for personalized T2I evaluation and optimization, advancing individually aligned image generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models generate semantically coherent images from textual prompts, yet evaluating how well they align with individual user preferences remains an open challenge. Conventional evaluation methods, general reward functions or similarity-based metrics, fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes. In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent. We further introduce PIGBench, a per-user preference benchmark capturing diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIGReward surpasses existing methods in both accuracy and interpretability, establishing a scalable and reasoning-based foundation for personalized T2I evaluation and optimization. Taken together, our findings highlight PIGReward as a robust steptoward individually aligned T2I generation.

*Boyu Chen,Zikang Wang,Zhengrong Yue,Kainan Yan,Chenyun Yu,Yi Huang,Zijun Liu,Yafei Wen,Xiaoxin Chen,Yang Liu,Peng Li,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoChat-M1 introduces a multi-agent system with a Collaborative Policy Planning paradigm for video understanding, outperforming SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent frameworks use static tool invocation, limiting robust perception for complex videos.

Method: Employs Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) with policy generation, execution, and communication, enhanced by MARL.

Result: Achieves SOTA on eight benchmarks, outperforming Gemini 2.5 pro by 3.6% and GPT-4o by 15.6%.

Conclusion: VideoChat-M1's dynamic CPP and MARL optimization significantly improve video understanding.

Abstract: By leveraging tool-augmented Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), multi-agent frameworks are driving progress in video understanding. However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks. Notably, on LongVideoBench, our method outperforms the SOTA model Gemini 2.5 pro by 3.6% and GPT-4o by 15.6%.

### [4] [SG-OIF: A Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework for Reliable Vision Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19466)
*Penghao Rao,Runmin Jiang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SG-OIF is a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework that improves influence estimation in deep-learning vision models by addressing computational and calibration challenges, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate influence estimation is crucial for identifying noisy data in deep-learning vision models, but current methods face computational inefficiency and dynamic training challenges.

Method: SG-OIF uses algorithmic stability as a real-time controller with lightweight anchor IHVPs and modular curvature backends for influence score modulation.

Result: SG-OIF achieves SOTA performance, with 91.1% accuracy in top 1% samples on CIFAR-10 and 99.8% AUPR on MNIST.

Conclusion: SG-OIF is a practical and effective solution for online influence estimation in deep-learning vision models.

Abstract: Approximating training-point influence on test predictions is critical for deploying deep-learning vision models, essential for locating noisy data. Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\% accuracy in the top 1\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\% asym), and gets 99.8\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.

### [5] [Pistachio: Towards Synthetic, Balanced, and Long-Form Video Anomaly Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19474)
*Jie Li,Hongyi Cai,Mingkang Dong,Muxin Pu,Shan You,Fei Wang,Tao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pistachio is a new benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Understanding (VAU) created using a controlled, generation-based pipeline to address biases in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD benchmarks lack scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity, while VAU lacks reliable benchmarks due to high manual annotation costs.

Method: Pistachio uses a pipeline with scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and temporally consistent long-form video synthesis to create coherent 41-second videos.

Result: Pistachio offers scale, diversity, and complexity, revealing challenges for current methods and encouraging future research on dynamic anomaly understanding.

Conclusion: Pistachio provides a controlled, scalable solution for benchmarking VAD/VAU, addressing limitations of existing datasets.

Abstract: Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.

### [6] [Tracking and Segmenting Anything in Any Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19475)
*Tianlu Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Guiguang Ding,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SATA is a universal framework unifying tracking and segmentation tasks with any modality input, addressing cross-modal and cross-task gaps via DeMoE and TaMOT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack generalization due to modality-specific parameters and overlooked distributional/representation gaps.

Method: Proposes SATA with DeMoE for shared/specific knowledge decoupling and TaMOT for unified instance outputs.

Result: Superior performance on 18 benchmarks.

Conclusion: SATA advances generalizable video understanding by bridging gaps and unifying tasks.

Abstract: Tracking and segmentation play essential roles in video understanding, providing basic positional information and temporal association of objects within video sequences. Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.

### [7] [The Determinant Ratio Matrix Approach to Solving 3D Matching and 2D Orthographic Projection Alignment Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19511)
*Andrew J. Hanson,Sonya M. Hanson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DRaM family of solutions for exact EnP and OnP pose estimation problems, providing new insights and comparisons with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the exact and noisy-data cases in 3D pose estimation (EnP) and orthographic projection pose estimation (OnP) using the DRaM approach, placing existing methods in a broader context.

Method: The authors solve least squares systems for error-free EnP and OnP problems using the DRaM approach and propose a rotation correction scheme for noisy data.

Result: The DRaM solutions provide exact solutions for EnP and generalize to OnP, offering a new perspective on these problems.

Conclusion: The work presents novel DRaM solutions for pose estimation, generalizing to N-dimensional problems and revealing derivations that could have been historically discovered earlier.

Abstract: Pose estimation is a general problem in computer vision with wide applications. The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems. With hindsight, we are able to show that our DRaM solutions to the exact EnP and OnP problems possess derivations that could have been discovered in the time of Gauss, and in fact generalize to all analogous N-dimensional Euclidean pose estimation problems.

### [8] [Single Image to High-Quality 3D Object via Latent Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19512)
*Huanning Dong,Yinuo Huang,Fan Li,Ping Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentDreamer is a framework for fast, detailed, high-fidelity 3D object generation from single images, leveraging latent features from a pre-trained VAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of simultaneous fast, detailed, and high-fidelity 3D generation from images.

Method: Uses a pre-trained variational autoencoder to map 3D geometries to latent features, then sequentially generates coarse and refined geometries and textures.

Result: Produces high-fidelity 3D objects quickly (~70 seconds) and competitively with minimal training.

Conclusion: LatentDreamer efficiently bridges the gap in automatic 3D generation, achieving quality and speed.

Abstract: 3D assets are essential in the digital age. While automatic 3D generation, such as image-to-3d, has made significant strides in recent years, it often struggles to achieve fast, detailed, and high-fidelity generation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce LatentDreamer, a novel framework for generating 3D objects from single images. The key to our approach is a pre-trained variational autoencoder that maps 3D geometries to latent features, which greatly reducing the difficulty of 3D generation. Starting from latent features, the pipeline of LatentDreamer generates coarse geometries, refined geometries, and realistic textures sequentially. The 3D objects generated by LatentDreamer exhibit high fidelity to the input images, and the entire generation process can be completed within a short time (typically in 70 seconds). Extensive experiments show that with only a small amount of training, LatentDreamer demonstrates competitive performance compared to contemporary approachs.

### [9] [Fewer Tokens, Greater Scaling: Self-Adaptive Visual Bases for Efficient and Expansive Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19515)
*Shawn Young,Xingyu Zeng,Lijian Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Explores how model size affects the number of visual tokens needed to maintain image semantics, introduces Orthogonal Filtering for token clustering, and reveals a scaling law between model size and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the relationship between model capacity and the minimal visual tokens required to preserve image semantics, inspired by the Minimum Description Length principle.

Method: Proposes Orthogonal Filtering, a lightweight module that clusters redundant tokens into orthogonal bases, and conducts experiments across various ViT models.

Result: Larger models need fewer tokens to span visual semantic space, demonstrating a consistent token-model scaling law. A visual long-context dataset is also introduced.

Conclusion: The study highlights the interplay between model capacity and token efficiency, offering insights into optimizing visual token usage in models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental relationship between model capacity and the minimal number of visual tokens required to preserve image semantics. Inspired by the Minimum Description Length principle, we reinterpret image tokens as vectors in a visual semantic space and define the intrinsic semantic complexity of an image as the smallest set of basis vectors needed to span this space. Building on this perspective, we propose Orthogonal Filtering, a lightweight module that adaptively clusters redundant tokens into a compact set of orthogonal bases. Through extensive experiments across a range of ViT models, we reveal a consistent token, model scaling law: larger models require significantly fewer tokens to span visual semantic space. Besides, we also contribute a visual long-context dataset.

### [10] [Connecting the Dots: Training-Free Visual Grounding via Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19516)
*Liqin Luo,Guangyao Chen,Xiawu Zheng,Yongxing Dai,Yixiong Zou,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroundingAgent introduces a zero-shot visual grounding framework using iterative reasoning with pretrained models, achieving competitive accuracy without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods that rely on extensive annotations and fine-tuning, hindering generalization to novel scenarios.

Method: Uses iterative reasoning with pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, MLLMs, and LLMs for joint semantic and spatial analysis.

Result: Achieves 65.1% zero-shot grounding accuracy on benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), with selection accuracy reaching ~90%.

Conclusion: GroundingAgent demonstrates strong performance and interpretability, leveraging LLM reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual grounding, the task of linking textual queries to specific regions within images, plays a pivotal role in vision-language integration. Existing methods typically rely on extensive task-specific annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively to novel or out-of-distribution scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce GroundingAgent, a novel agentic visual grounding framework that operates without any task-specific fine-tuning. GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities. GroundingAgent also offers strong interpretability, transparently illustrating each reasoning step and providing clear insights into its decision-making process.

### [11] [Towards Efficient VLMs: Information-Theoretic Driven Compression via Adaptive Structural Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19518)
*Zhaoqi Xu,Yingying Zhang,Jian Li,Jianwei Guo,Qiannan Zhu,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoPrune is an information-theoretic framework for compressing vision-language models, balancing task-relevant semantics and redundancy removal. It achieves significant efficiency gains with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compression methods lack theoretical guarantees for information preservation, prompting the need for a principled approach like InfoPrune.

Method: InfoPrune uses entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and KS distance to prune attention heads adaptively, coupled with low-rank FFN compression.

Result: The method reduces FLOPs by 3.2x and accelerates models by 1.8x with negligible degradation on VQA tasks.

Conclusion: InfoPrune provides a theoretically grounded and practical solution for efficient multimodal model compression.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their ever-growing scale poses severe challenges for deployment and efficiency. Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.

### [12] [Blinking Beyond EAR: A Stable Eyelid Angle Metric for Driver Drowsiness Detection and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19519)
*Mathis Wolter,Julie Stephany Berrio Perez,Mao Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel metric for driver drowsiness detection, offering robustness to camera angles and enabling synthetic data creation for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable driver drowsiness detection is essential for road safety and ADAS. Current methods lack stability and robustness to camera angle variations.

Method: ELA, derived from 3D facial landmarks, measures eye openness. A blink detection framework extracts temporal blink characteristics. Synthetic datasets with controllable parameters are created using ELA signals in Blender 3D.

Result: ELA shows lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection. Synthetic data augmentation enhances training diversity.

Conclusion: ELA is a reliable biometric measure and effective tool for scalable dataset generation in driver state monitoring.

Abstract: Detecting driver drowsiness reliably is crucial for enhancing road safety and supporting advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection. At the same time, synthetic augmentation expands the diversity of training data for drowsiness recognition. Our findings highlight the ELA as both a reliable biometric measure and a powerful tool for generating scalable datasets in driver state monitoring.

### [13] [Perceptual Taxonomy: Evaluating and Guiding Hierarchical Scene Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19526)
*Jonathan Lee,Xingrui Wang,Jiawei Peng,Luoxin Ye,Zehan Zheng,Tiezheng Zhang,Tao Wang,Wufei Ma,Siyi Chen,Yu-Cheng Chou,Prakhar Kaushik,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Perceptual Taxonomy introduces a benchmark for grounded visual reasoning, evaluating models on object properties and structured reasoning, revealing gaps in current vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive evaluation of structured scene understanding in current vision-language benchmarks, focusing on deeper reasoning like material, affordance, and function.

Method: Developed Perceptual Taxonomy benchmark with annotated objects (3173) across 4 property families (84 attributes), creating 28033 template-based questions and 50 expert-crafted questions.

Result: Leading models perform well on recognition but degrade by 10-20% on property-driven questions, especially multi-step reasoning. In-context reasoning examples improve performance.

Conclusion: Current models lack structured visual understanding, relying on pattern matching. Perceptual-taxonomy-guided prompting shows promise for improving reasoning.

Abstract: We propose Perceptual Taxonomy, a structured process of scene understanding that first recognizes objects and their spatial configurations, then infers task-relevant properties such as material, affordance, function, and physical attributes to support goal-directed reasoning. While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.
  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.
  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching. We also show that providing in-context reasoning examples from simulated scenes improves performance on real-world and expert-curated questions, demonstrating the effectiveness of perceptual-taxonomy-guided prompting.

### [14] [MapRF: Weakly Supervised Online HD Map Construction via NeRF-Guided Self-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19527)
*Hongyu Lyu,Thomas Monninger,Julie Stephany Berrio Perez,Mao Shan,Zhenxing Ming,Stewart Worrall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapRF is a weakly supervised framework for online HD map construction using only 2D image labels, leveraging NeRF for pseudo labels and iterative self-training to match fully supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HD map methods rely on costly 3D annotations, limiting scalability. MapRF aims to reduce reliance on such annotations by using 2D labels and self-training.

Method: MapRF combines a NeRF module for view-consistent 3D pseudo labels with iterative self-training and Map-to-Ray Matching to align predictions with camera rays.

Result: MapRF achieves ~75% of fully supervised performance on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes, outperforming other 2D-label-only methods.

Conclusion: MapRF demonstrates scalable, cost-effective HD map construction, reducing dependency on 3D annotations while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems benefit from high-definition (HD) maps that provide critical information about road infrastructure. The online construction of HD maps offers a scalable approach to generate local maps from on-board sensors. However, existing methods typically rely on costly 3D map annotations for training, which limits their generalization and scalability across diverse driving environments. In this work, we propose MapRF, a weakly supervised framework that learns to construct 3D maps using only 2D image labels. To generate high-quality pseudo labels, we introduce a novel Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) module conditioned on map predictions, which reconstructs view-consistent 3D geometry and semantics. These pseudo labels are then iteratively used to refine the map network in a self-training manner, enabling progressive improvement without additional supervision. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation during self-training, we propose a Map-to-Ray Matching strategy that aligns map predictions with camera rays derived from 2D labels. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that MapRF achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, attaining around 75% of the baseline while surpassing several approaches using only 2D labels. This highlights the potential of MapRF to enable scalable and cost-effective online HD map construction for autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vidi2 advances video understanding with spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and video QA, introducing benchmarks VUE-STG and VUE-TR-V2, outperforming proprietary systems like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance scalable, high-quality video production by improving multimodal temporal retrieval and extending capabilities to spatio-temporal grounding and video QA.

Method: Vidi2 integrates fine-grained STG and video QA, introducing benchmarks VUE-STG (for STG) and VUE-TR-V2 (for temporal retrieval) with improved video duration, query format, annotation quality, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Vidi2 outperforms proprietary systems (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5) on benchmarks and competes with open-source models in video QA.

Conclusion: Vidi2 demonstrates robust performance in video understanding, enabling applications like complex editing and multimodal reasoning, validated by the new benchmarks.

Abstract: Video has emerged as the primary medium for communication and creativity on the Internet, driving strong demand for scalable, high-quality video production. Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.

TL;DR: A multimodal large language model (LLM) outperforms traditional CV models in cross-domain generalization for global photovoltaic (PV) system assessment, showing robustness and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Undocumented PV systems challenge grid management, and traditional CV models lack generalization across regions.

Method: The study uses structured prompts and fine-tuning to integrate detection, localization, and quantification in a unified LLM schema.

Result: The model achieves minimal performance degradation across unseen regions, surpassing traditional CV and transformer baselines.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs offer scalable, transferable, and interpretable solutions for global PV mapping.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems poses challenges for power grid management, as many installations remain undocumented. While satellite imagery provides global coverage, traditional computer vision (CV) models such as CNNs and U-Nets require extensive labeled data and fail to generalize across regions. This study investigates the cross-domain generalization of a multimodal large language model (LLM) for global PV assessment. By leveraging structured prompts and fine-tuning, the model integrates detection, localization, and quantification within a unified schema. Cross-regional evaluation using the $Δ$F1 metric demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the smallest performance degradation across unseen regions, outperforming conventional CV and transformer baselines. These results highlight the robustness of multimodal LLMs under domain shift and their potential for scalable, transferable, and interpretable global PV mapping.

### [17] [Studying Maps at Scale: A Digital Investigation of Cartography and the Evolution of Figuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19538)
*Remi Petitpierre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This thesis explores large-scale cartographic heritage through cultural and historical lenses, analyzing datasets and automated methods to uncover trends in map production, geographic focus, and cartographic symbolism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between automated map analysis and the historical/cultural context of cartography, viewing maps as semantic-symbolic systems reflecting political and epistemic expectations.

Method: Leveraging a dataset of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images from 38 catalogs, the research employs normalization, semantic segmentation, and object detection models trained on annotated and synthetic data.

Result: Findings reveal links between cartographic focus and political dynamics (e.g., colonial expansion), semantic symmetries in map design, and figurative shifts (e.g., hachures to contours). It also highlights collaboration patterns in semiotic cultures.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates how large-scale cartographic analysis can uncover cultural and historical insights, emphasizing maps as designed images with locally consistent symbolic systems shaped by broader societal factors.

Abstract: This thesis presents methods and datasets to investigate cartographic heritage on a large scale and from a cultural perspective. Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems. Analyses of collaboration and diffusion highlight the role of legitimacy, larger actors, and major cities in the spread of figurative norms and semiotic cultures.

*Jaeyeong Kim,Seungwoo Yoo,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpLap is a proxy-free deformation method for Gaussian splats using a Laplacian operator from a surface-aware splat graph, outperforming existing proxy-based and proxy-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GS deformation methods rely on proxies or fail to capture surface details; SpLap aims to solve these issues.

Method: Constructs a surface-aware splat graph and uses a Laplacian operator for deformation, with Gaussian kernel adaptation to preserve surface structure.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance on 50 challenging objects from multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SpLap provides plausible deformations while preserving details and topology, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: We introduce SpLap, a proxy-free deformation method for Gaussian splats (GS) based on a Laplacian operator computed from our novel surface-aware splat graph. Existing approaches to GS deformation typically rely on deformation proxies such as cages or meshes, but they suffer from dependency on proxy quality and additional computational overhead. An alternative is to directly apply Laplacian-based deformation techniques by treating splats as point clouds. However, this often fail to properly capture surface information due to lack of explicit structure. To address this, we propose a novel method that constructs a surface-aware splat graph, enabling the Laplacian operator derived from it to support more plausible deformations that preserve details and topology. Our key idea is to leverage the spatial arrangement encoded in splats, defining neighboring splats not merely by the distance between their centers, but by their intersections. Furthermore, we introduce a Gaussian kernel adaptation technique that preserves surface structure under deformation, thereby improving rendering quality after deformation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to both proxy-based and proxy-free baselines, evaluated on 50 challenging objects from the ShapeNet, Objaverse, and Sketchfab datasets, as well as the NeRF-Synthetic dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/kjae0/SpLap.

TL;DR: Proposes ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage VQA framework for disaster damage assessment, combining generative models with reasoning-guided answer selection to improve accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in AI-based disaster damage assessment, such as expensive data annotation, limited datasets, and inflexible answer spaces in existing models.

Method: Employs ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage framework using CoT prompting, ICL for reasoning, and an answer selection module for contextually accurate responses.

Result: Demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA datasets.

Conclusion: ThiFAN-VQA effectively bridges zero-shot and supervised methods, enhancing disaster damage assessment.

Abstract: Timely and accurate assessment of damages following natural disasters is essential for effective emergency response and recovery. Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency. Experiments on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA, UAV-based datasets from flood- and hurricane-affected regions, demonstrate that ThiFAN-VQA achieves superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for real-world post-disaster damage assessment tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile, efficient OCR solution that overcomes limitations of narrow expert models and inefficient general VLMs, unifying core capabilities in a lightweight framework.

Method: Combines a Native Vision Transformer and lightweight LLM via an MLP adapter, adopts an end-to-end paradigm, and employs data-driven and RL strategies.

Result: Superior performance over commercial APIs and larger models, achieving SOTA in OCRBench and winning ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track).

Conclusion: HunyuanOCR advances OCR research and industrial applications, offering high performance, simplicity, and open-source accessibility.

Abstract: This paper presents HunyuanOCR, a commercial-grade, open-source, and lightweight (1B parameters) Vision-Language Model (VLM) dedicated to OCR tasks. The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.
  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow "OCR expert models" and inefficient "General VLMs". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.
  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.

### [21] [Leveraging Unlabeled Scans for NCCT Image Segmentation in Early Stroke Diagnosis: A Semi-Supervised GAN Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19576)
*Maria Thoma,Michalis A. Savelonas,Dimitris K. Iakovidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised GAN-based method improves early ischemic stroke detection on NCCT scans by leveraging limited labeled and unlabeled data, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early ischemic stroke detection on NCCT scans is challenging due to subtle changes, delaying interventions. Addressing this can improve diagnoses and outcomes.

Method: Uses semi-supervised GANs with Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, feature matching loss, and self-training loss to segment stroke regions from limited labeled and unlabeled NCCT scans.

Result: Tested on AISD, the method enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces manual annotation needs, and aids clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: The proposed GAN-based approach effectively identifies early strokes, offering a promising tool for faster and more accurate diagnosis.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke is a time-critical medical emergency where rapid diagnosis is essential for improving patient outcomes. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSVQ-VAE, a multiscale VAE-based method for generating diverse and abnormal WCE images to address data scarcity in GI imaging CDS systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual screening of WCE images is resource-intensive, and deep learning CDS systems face challenges due to limited training data. Synthetic data generation can mitigate this, but current methods struggle with diversity and stability.

Method: Proposes MSVQ-VAE, a multiscale extension of VQ-VAE, to generate synthetic WCE images with abnormalities (e.g., polyps, vascular issues). It enables conditional generation and modifies normal images to introduce abnormalities.

Result: Training CDS classifiers with synthetic images yields performance comparable to real data. The method effectively generates diverse abnormal images.

Conclusion: MSVQ-VAE offers a viable solution for synthetic medical image generation, enhancing CDS systems. Its generality suggests broader applications in medical multimedia.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data. The generality of the proposed methodology promises its applicability to various domains related to medical multimedia.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkillSight introduces a power-efficient skill assessment method using gaze and egocentric video, eliminating continuous video processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transform learning new skills via egocentric perception on smart glasses by addressing the challenge of automatic skill assessment.

Method: A two-stage framework: first learns to model gaze and video jointly for skill prediction, then distills a gaze-only student model.

Result: SkillSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the gaze-only student maintaining high accuracy using 73x less power.

Conclusion: SkillSight demonstrates gaze's value in skill understanding and enables energy-efficient AI-supported learning.

Abstract: Egocentric perception on smart glasses could transform how we learn new skills in the physical world, but automatic skill assessment remains a fundamental technical challenge. We introduce SkillSight for power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data. Central to our approach is the hypothesis that skill level is evident not only in how a person performs an activity (video), but also in how they direct their attention when doing so (gaze). Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing. Experiments on three datasets spanning cooking, music, and sports establish, for the first time, the valuable role of gaze in skill understanding across diverse real-world settings. Our SkillSight teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance, while our gaze-only student variant maintains high accuracy using 73x less power than competing methods. These results pave the way for in-the-wild AI-supported skill learning.

*Ruimin Feng,Xingxin He,Ronald Mercer,Zachary Stewart,Fang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-language foundation model enhances undersampled MRI reconstruction by aligning semantic features with high-level contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if vision-language models can provide high-level contextual information beyond conventional priors for better MRI reconstruction.

Method: A semantic distribution-guided framework uses pre-trained vision-language models to encode image and auxiliary data into semantic features, aligning them contrastively with target distributions.

Result: Semantic priors from images preserved anatomical structures and improved perceptual quality; image-language data expanded semantic control. The framework maintained data fidelity while optimizing semantics.

Conclusion: Vision-language foundation models effectively enhance MRI reconstruction through semantic-space optimization.

Abstract: Purpose: To investigate whether a vision-language foundation model can enhance undersampled MRI reconstruction by providing high-level contextual information beyond conventional priors. Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework. Conclusion: The study highlights that vision-language foundation models can improve undersampled MRI reconstruction through semantic-space optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces GIANT, a framework adapting large multimodal models (LMMs) to navigate gigapixel pathology images iteratively, outperforming patch- and thumbnail-based methods and matching specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LMMs underperform in medical image interpretation, especially pathology, due to inadequate methods like low-resolution thumbnails or random patches.

Method: GIANT enables LMMs to navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) iteratively, tested using MultiPathQA, a benchmark with 934 WSI-level questions.

Result: GIANT significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving 62.5% accuracy on pathologist-authored questions, surpassing specialized models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight potential for LMMs in expert pathology tasks and guide future development.

Abstract: Despite being widely used to support clinical care, general-purpose large multimodal models (LMMs) have generally shown poor or inconclusive performance in medical image interpretation, particularly in pathology, where gigapixel images are used. However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%). Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current foundation models and ground future development of LMMs for expert reasoning in pathology.

*Xinhai Hou,Shaoyuan Xu,Manan Biyani,Mayan Li,Jia Liu,Todd C. Hollon,Bryan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights unfaithful visual reasoning in agentic vision-language models, introduces CodeV with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO) for faithful tool-use, and demonstrates improved accuracy and faithfulness across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High final-answer accuracy often masks unfaithful visual reasoning, where models misuse tools or ignore outputs. This undermines trustworthiness in agentic systems.

Method: The authors propose CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with TAPO, a process-level RL framework. TAPO uses dense rewards on tool inputs/outputs rather than chain-of-thought tokens.

Result: CodeV improves faithful tool-use rates while maintaining competitive accuracy on visual search benchmarks and performs well on multimodal reasoning and math tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit supervision of intermediate tool behavior is key to building trustworthy visual reasoning systems, as demonstrated by CodeV's success.

Abstract: Agentic vision-language models are increasingly trained to "think with images" by calling image operations. However, we show that high final-answer accuracy often hides unfaithful visual reasoning: models may invoke tools on irrelevant regions or ignore tool outputs entirely, yet still guess the correct answer. In this work, we first propose a faithfulness evaluation protocol that measures whether intermediate visual tool outputs (e.g., crops) actually contain the queried evidence. This reveals that recent visual agents achieve high final-answer accuracy but exhibit low rates of faithful tool-use on visual search benchmarks. We then introduce CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO). TAPO is a process-level RL framework that augments GRPO with dense rewards defined directly on visual tool inputs and outputs, rather than on chain-of-thought tokens, making supervision easier to verify and less susceptible to reward hacking. CodeV represents visual tools as executable Python code, and TAPO assigns step-wise rewards based solely on the question and tool output, encouraging both necessary and evidence-consistent tool use. In a two-stage SFT+RL pipeline, CodeV achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates on related visual search benchmarks. Beyond visual search, CodeV attains strong performance on a range of multimodal reasoning and math benchmarks, suggesting that explicitly supervising intermediate tool behavior is crucial for building trustworthy, agentic visual reasoning systems.

Motivation: To enhance breast cancer diagnosis by integrating imaging and clinical data, addressing variability and improving early detection, especially in underserved areas.

Method: Uses an attention-based encoder-decoder backbone for ROI segmentation and clinical feature prediction, with two late-fusion strategies for multimodal data integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in segmentation and clinical prediction, producing structured reports with dual-confidence scoring and visualizations.

Conclusion: OncoVision offers a scalable, equitable solution for early breast cancer detection, improving clinician trust and accessibility in underserved regions.

Abstract: OncoVision is a multimodal AI pipeline that combines mammography images and clinical data for better breast cancer diagnosis. Employing an attention-based encoder-decoder backbone, it jointly segments four ROIs - masses, calcifications, axillary findings, and breast tissues - with state-of-the-art accuracy and robustly predicts ten structured clinical features: mass morphology, calcification type, ACR breast density, and BI-RADS categories. To fuse imaging and clinical insights, we developed two late-fusion strategies. By utilizing complementary multimodal data, late fusion strategies improve diagnostic precision and reduce inter-observer variability. Operationalized as a secure, user-friendly web application, OncoVision produces structured reports with dual-confidence scoring and attention-weighted visualizations for real-time diagnostic support to improve clinician trust and facilitate medical teaching. It can be easily incorporated into the clinic, making screening available in underprivileged areas around the world, such as rural South Asia. Combining accurate segmentation with clinical intuition, OncoVision raises the bar for AI-based mammography, offering a scalable and equitable solution to detect breast cancer at an earlier stage and enhancing treatment through timely interventions.

TL;DR: INTERLACE is a framework that prunes redundant layers in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) efficiently by analyzing triplets of layers, finetuning selectively, and freezing anchors to retain performance with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layer pruning methods cause significant performance drops in VLMs, motivating a need for a more efficient and effective approach.

Method: The method analyzes consecutive layer triplets, prunes redundant layers, finetunes selectively, and freezes anchors to stabilize performance.

Result: INTERLACE retains 88.9% performance after pruning 25% of layers, using only 1% of data for finetuning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: INTERLACE offers an efficient and high-performing solution for pruning VLMs with minimal data and computation.

Abstract: We introduce INTERLACE, a novel framework that prunes redundant layers in VLMs while maintaining performance through sample-efficient finetuning. Existing layer pruning methods lead to significant performance drop when applied to VLMs. Instead, we analyze triplets of consecutive layers to identify local redundancy, removing the most redundant of the first two layers, finetune the remaining layer to compensate for the lost capacity, and freeze the third layer to serve as a stable anchor during finetuning. We found that this interleaved finetune-freeze design enables rapid convergence with minimal data after pruning. By finetuning only a subset of layers on just 1% of the FineVision dataset for one epoch, Interlace achieves 88.9% average performance retention after dropping 25% of the network, achieving SOTA performance.

Method: Integrates a prototype layer into a density estimation network to learn visual patterns for cells and background artifacts.

Result: Achieves interpretability without compromising counting accuracy; biologists confirmed prototype relevance.

Conclusion: Provides a transparent, reliable tool for cell counting, fostering trust in deep learning for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Cell counting in biomedical imaging is pivotal for various clinical applications, yet the interpretability of deep learning models in this domain remains a significant challenge. We propose a novel prototype-based method for interpretable cell counting via density map estimation. Our approach integrates a prototype layer into the density estimation network, enabling the model to learn representative visual patterns for both cells and background artifacts. The learned prototypes were evaluated through a survey of biologists, who confirmed the relevance of the visual patterns identified, further validating the interpretability of the model. By generating interpretations that highlight regions in the input image most similar to each prototype, our method offers a clear understanding of how the model identifies and counts cells. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves interpretability without compromising counting effectiveness. This work provides researchers and clinicians with a transparent and reliable tool for cell counting, potentially increasing trust and accelerating the adoption of deep learning in critical biomedical applications.

*Omar Alama,Darshil Jariwala,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Seungchan Kim,Wenshan Wang,Sebastian Scherer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADSeg leverages RADIO for zero-shot OVSS, improving mIoU, latency, and parameter efficiency via innovative techniques like recursive attention and efficient mask refinement. It outperforms larger models with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVSS approaches struggle with generalization, computational costs, or reliance on large models. RADSeg aims to address these by utilizing RADIO and enhancing its performance.

Method: RADSeg employs self-correlating recursive attention, self-correlating global aggregation, and efficient mask refinement to improve RADIO's zero-shot OVSS capabilities.

Result: RADSeg achieves 6-30% mIoU improvement, is 3.95x faster, and uses 2.5x fewer parameters than competitors, outperforming larger models (850-1350M) with only 105M parameters.

Conclusion: RADSeg sets a new benchmark for zero-shot OVSS by combining efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating RADIO's potential as a foundation model.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) underpins many vision and robotics tasks that require generalizable semantic understanding. Existing approaches either rely on limited segmentation training data, which hinders generalization, or apply zero-shot heuristics to vision-language models (e.g CLIP), while the most competitive approaches combine multiple models to improve performance at the cost of high computational and memory demands. In this work, we leverage an overlooked agglomerative vision foundation model, RADIO, to improve zero-shot OVSS along three key axes simultaneously: mIoU, latency, and parameter efficiency. We present the first comprehensive study of RADIO for zero-shot OVSS and enhance its performance through self-correlating recursive attention, self-correlating global aggregation, and computationally efficient mask refinement. Our approach, RADSeg, achieves 6-30% mIoU improvement in the base ViT class while being 3.95x faster and using 2.5x fewer parameters. Surprisingly, RADSeg-base (105M) outperforms previous combinations of huge vision models (850-1350M) in mIoU, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower computational and memory cost.

*Chengwei Zhou,Vipin Chaudhary,Gourav Datta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a branch-based structural reparameterization technique to reduce the number of transformer layers in Vision Transformers while maintaining accuracy, achieving up to 37% speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing acceleration strategies focus on algorithmic optimizations, leaving layer reduction underexplored despite its potential to reduce computational overhead.

Method: A branch-based structural reparameterization technique merges parallel branches during training to consolidate transformer blocks into fewer layers.

Result: Applied to ViT-Tiny, the method reduces layers from 12 to as few as 3 without losing accuracy, achieving up to 37% inference speedup.

Conclusion: The study challenges the need for deep transformer stacks and highlights opportunities for more efficient vision transformers.

Abstract: The computational overhead of Vision Transformers in practice stems fundamentally from their deep architectures, yet existing acceleration strategies have primarily targeted algorithmic-level optimizations such as token pruning and attention speedup. This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The resulting compressed models achieve inference speedups of up to 37% on mobile CPU platforms. Our findings suggest that the conventional wisdom favoring extremely deep transformer stacks may be unnecessarily restrictive, and point toward new opportunities for constructing efficient vision transformers.

TL;DR: Proposed an altitude-aware dynamic tiling method for UAVs in SAR missions, improving small object detection by 38% mAP and doubling inference speed compared to static tiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small objects are hard to detect from high altitudes in UAV-based SAR missions due to low pixel ratios. Enhancing detection efficiency and accuracy is crucial.

Method: Uses altitude-aware dynamic tiling to scale and adaptively subdivide images, integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor. Tested on SeaDronesSee dataset with YOLOv5 and SAHI framework.

Result: Improved mAP for small objects by 38% and achieved over double the inference speed compared to static tiling.

Conclusion: The method enables more efficient and accurate UAV-based SAR operations under diverse conditions.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are crucial in Search and Rescue (SAR) missions due to their ability to monitor vast maritime areas. However, small objects often remain difficult to detect from high altitudes due to low object-to-background pixel ratios. We propose an altitude-aware dynamic tiling method that scales and adaptively subdivides the image into tiles for enhanced small object detection. By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance. Tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset [1] with YOLOv5 [2] and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework [3], our approach improves Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% compared to a baseline and achieves more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling. This approach enables more efficient and accurate UAV-based SAR operations under diverse conditions.

### [34] [Efficient Transferable Optimal Transport via Min-Sliced Transport Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19741)
*Xinran Liu,Elaheh Akbari,Rocio Diaz Martin,Navid NaderiAlizadeh,Soheil Kolouri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the transferability of optimized slicers in Optimal Transport (OT) for efficient matching tasks under distributional shifts, introducing a minibatch min-STP framework with theoretical and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of OT limits scalability. While slice-based methods reduce costs, their transferability under distributional shifts remains unexplored, which is crucial for evolving data or related distributions.

Method: The authors study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP), investigating slicer transferability and introducing a minibatch version with statistical guarantees.

Result: Theoretically, slicers remain stable under slight data perturbations. Empirically, min-STP performs well in one-shot matching and amortized training for tasks like point cloud alignment and generative modeling.

Conclusion: Optimized slicers in min-STP are transferable across related distribution pairs, offering scalable and efficient solutions for OT tasks in computer vision.

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) offers a powerful framework for finding correspondences between distributions and addressing matching and alignment problems in various areas of computer vision, including shape analysis, image generation, and multimodal tasks. The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transferable min-STP achieves strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.

Motivation: Addressing challenges in adapting pathology foundation models due to WSI complexity, feature opacity, and diverse adaptation strategies.

Method: Developed PathFMTools, a Python package, to interface and evaluate CONCH and MUSK models on 440 cSCC WSIs, benchmarking adaptation strategies.

Result: Demonstrated trade-offs in prediction approaches and validated foundation model embeddings for training specialist models.

Conclusion: Pathology foundation models show promise for clinical use, with PathFMTools facilitating efficient analysis.

Abstract: Despite the promise of computational pathology foundation models, adapting them to specific clinical tasks remains challenging due to the complexity of whole-slide image (WSI) processing, the opacity of learned features, and the wide range of potential adaptation strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce PathFMTools, a lightweight, extensible Python package that enables efficient execution, analysis, and visualization of pathology foundation models. We use this tool to interface with and evaluate two state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models, CONCH and MUSK, on the task of histological grading in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a critical criterion that informs cSCC staging and patient management. Using a cohort of 440 cSCC H&E WSIs, we benchmark multiple adaptation strategies, demonstrating trade-offs across prediction approaches and validating the potential of using foundation model embeddings to train small specialist models. These findings underscore the promise of pathology foundation models for real-world clinical applications, with PathFMTools enabling efficient analysis and validation.

*Muchang Bahng,Charlie Berens,Jon Donnelly,Eric Chen,Chaofan Chen,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets) to address interpretability and cost issues in multimodal species detection, achieving comparable accuracy while reducing reliance on expensive genetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Species detection is vital for ecosystem monitoring and conservation, but current multimodal neural networks lack interpretability and rely on costly genetic data.

Method: The authors extend ProtoPNets to a multimodal, cost-aware setting, ensembling prototypes from each modality with weighted predictions and introducing methods to avoid unnecessary genetic data.

Result: The approach effectively allocates genetic data for fine-grained distinctions, uses image data for clearer visual classifications, and matches accuracy of models using both modalities.

Conclusion: The extended ProtoPNets offer an interpretable and cost-efficient solution for species detection, balancing accuracy with reduced reliance on expensive genetic data.

Abstract: Species detection is important for monitoring the health of ecosystems and identifying invasive species, serving a crucial role in guiding conservation efforts. Multimodal neural networks have seen increasing use for identifying species to help automate this task, but they have two major drawbacks. First, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of their decision making process. Second, collecting genetic data is often expensive and requires invasive procedures, often necessitating researchers to capture or kill the target specimen. We address both of these problems by extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets), which are a popular and interpretable alternative to traditional neural networks, to the multimodal, cost-aware setting. We ensemble prototypes from each modality, using an associated weight to determine how much a given prediction relies on each modality. We further introduce methods to identify cases for which we do not need the expensive genetic information to make confident predictions. We demonstrate that our approach can intelligently allocate expensive genetic data for fine-grained distinctions while using abundant image data for clearer visual classifications and achieving comparable accuracy to models that consistently use both modalities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VESSA, a vision-language enhanced semi-supervised segmentation assistant, integrating VLMs into SSL for medical image segmentation to improve accuracy with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on expert annotations in medical image segmentation by leveraging VLMs' generalization capabilities within SSL frameworks.

Method: VESSA involves two stages: training a VLM-enhanced foundation model with exemplars (Stage 1) and integrating it into an SSL framework for dynamic interaction and pseudo-label refinement (Stage 2).

Result: VESSA significantly enhances segmentation accuracy across datasets, outperforming baselines in limited annotation scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs into SSL via VESSA improves medical image segmentation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating strong generalization and performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for medical image segmentation, reducing the reliance on extensive expert annotations. Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization and few-shot capabilities across diverse visual domains. In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation datasets and domains show that VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces the 'relative angle' feature for point cloud reconstruction of damage, reducing data volume while maintaining accuracy, achieving 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of image-based methods vulnerable to background noise and high 3D data volume in point cloud reconstruction of damage.

Method: Proposes the 'relative angle' feature, computed as the angle between a point's normal vector and its parent point cloud's average normal vector. Uses entropy-based evaluation and trains/test models with PointNet++.

Result: Models using relative angles matched performance of normal vector-based models while reducing storage by 27.6% and input channels by 83%.

Conclusion: The relative angle feature effectively filters redundant data in undamaged sections and retains critical damage information, enabling efficient execution on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Point cloud reconstruction of damage offers an effective solution to image-based methods vulnerable to background noise, yet its application is constrained by the high volume of 3D data. This study proposes a new feature, relative angle, computed as the angle between the normal vector of a point and the average normal vector of its parent point cloud. This single-dimensional feature provides directionality information equivalent to normal vectors for concrete surface defect characteristics. Through entropy-based feature evaluation, this study demonstrates the ability of relative angle to filter out redundant information in undamaged sections while retaining effective information in damaged sections. By training and testing with PointNet++, models based on the relative angles achieved similar performance to that of models based on normal vectors while delivering 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression. This novel feature has the potential to enable larger-batch execution on resource-constrained hardware without the necessity of architectural modifications to models.

*Ali Torabi,Sanjog Gaihre,Yaqoob Majeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrispFormer enhances SegFormer's decoder for weak supervision with boundary supervision, uncertainty-guided refinement, and dynamic multi-scale fusion, improving segmentation accuracy without heavy post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) by enhancing the SegFormer decoder with minimal changes, focusing on crisper boundaries and better noise resistance.

Method: Augments the decoder with: (1) a boundary branch for thin contours, (2) an uncertainty-guided refiner for weighted losses and corrections, and (3) dynamic multi-scale fusion for adaptive feature selection.

Result: Achieves better boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines while adding minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: CrispFormer offers a simple, effective, and compatible solution for higher-fidelity masks from weak supervision.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) must learn dense masks from noisy, under-specified cues. We revisit the SegFormer decoder and show that three small, synergistic changes make weak supervision markedly more effective-without altering the MiT backbone or relying on heavy post-processing. Our method, CrispFormer, augments the decoder with: (1) a boundary branch that supervises thin object contours using a lightweight edge head and a boundary-aware loss; (2) an uncertainty-guided refiner that predicts per-pixel aleatoric uncertainty and uses it to weight losses and gate a residual correction of the segmentation logits; and (3) a dynamic multi-scale fusion layer that replaces static concatenation with spatial softmax gating over multi-resolution features, optionally modulated by uncertainty. The result is a single-pass model that preserves crisp boundaries, selects appropriate scales per location, and resists label noise from weak cues. Integrated into a standard WSSS pipeline (seed, student, and EMA relabeling), CrispFormer consistently improves boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines trained on the same seeds, while adding minimal compute. Our decoder-centric formulation is simple to implement, broadly compatible with existing SegFormer variants, and offers a reproducible path to higher-fidelity masks from image-level supervision.

*Debin Meng,Chen Jin,Zheng Gao,Yanran Li,Ioannis Patras,Georgios Tzimiropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPSO addresses low diversity in text-to-image diffusion models by exploring underrepresented token embedding regions, improving diversity without losing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adequately diversify outputs or maintain image quality, prompting the need for a training-free solution like TPSO.

Method: TPSO introduces learnable parameters to optimize token-prompt embedding space, avoiding dominant modes in the learned distribution.

Result: TPSO boosts diversity scores from 1.10 to 4.18 across multiple diffusion models on MS-COCO, preserving image quality.

Conclusion: TPSO effectively enhances generative diversity without compromising fidelity, offering a practical solution for text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Image diversity remains a fundamental challenge for text-to-image diffusion models. Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune-Then-Plan framework stabilizes VLM-based exploration by pruning implausible choices and using a planner, improving navigation efficiency and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs improve EQA tasks but cause frontier oscillations due to overconfidence, leading to inefficient navigation.

Method: Uses Holm-Bonferroni pruning to eliminate unlikely choices and a coverage-based planner for final decisions.

Result: Achieves up to 49% improvement in SPL and 33% in LLM-Match, with better scene coverage.

Conclusion: The framework successfully calibrates VLM behavior, enhancing navigation and answer quality.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved embodied question answering (EQA) agents by providing strong semantic priors for open-vocabulary reasoning. However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines. Overall, our method achieves better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets on both OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.

TL;DR: CropVLM enhances VLMs' fine-grained image understanding by dynamically zooming in on relevant regions, trained via reinforcement learning, improving performance without modifying the VLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with fine-grained tasks like scene-text recognition due to visual fragmentation and perception limits.

Method: Introduces CropVLM, a reinforcement learning-trained external module that dynamically focuses on image regions without human-labeled data or synthetic evaluations.

Result: Significantly boosts performance on high-resolution tasks, including out-of-domain benchmarks, without VLM modifications.

Conclusion: CropVLM is a scalable, low-cost solution for improving VLMs' fine-grained understanding without risking catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with tasks that require fine-grained image understanding, such as scene-text recognition or document analysis, due to perception limitations and visual fragmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce CropVLM as an external low-cost method for boosting performance, enabling VLMs to dynamically ''zoom in'' on relevant image regions, enhancing their ability to capture fine details. CropVLM is trained using reinforcement learning, without using human-labeled bounding boxes as a supervision signal, and without expensive synthetic evaluations. The model is trained once and can be paired with both open-source and proprietary VLMs to improve their performance. Our approach delivers significant improvements on tasks that require high-resolution image understanding, notably for benchmarks that are out-of-domain for the target VLM, without modifying or fine-tuning the VLM, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

### [43] [One Attention, One Scale: Phase-Aligned Rotary Positional Embeddings for Mixed-Resolution Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19778)
*Haoyu Wu,Jingyi Xu,Qiaomu Miao,Dimitris Samaras,Hieu Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses a failure mode in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) caused by linear interpolation on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) during mixed-resolution denoising, leading to attention collapse. The proposed solution, Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), stabilizes attention by aligning RoPE phases without training, enabling high-fidelity mixed-resolution generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the structural issue where linear interpolation on RoPE destabilizes attention mechanisms in DiTs during mixed-resolution denoising, causing blur, artifacts, or collapse.

Method: The method introduces CRPA, a training-free fix that adjusts the RoPE index map so phases align across resolutions, ensuring consistent phase increments for equal physical distances.

Result: CRPA stabilizes attention uniformly across heads and layers, enabling high-fidelity mixed-resolution generation and outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: CRPA effectively resolves the phase aliasing issue in DiTs, offering a robust solution for mixed-resolution generation without requiring retraining.

Abstract: We identify a core failure mode that occurs when using the usual linear interpolation on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) for mixed-resolution denoising with Diffusion Transformers. When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.
  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly. We demonstrate that CRPA enables high-fidelity and efficient mixed-resolution generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on image and video generation.

*Chengyue Huang,Mellon M. Zhang,Robert Azarcon,Glen Chou,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPS is a fine-tuning framework for Vision-Language-Action models that balances stability and flexibility by relaxing proximity constraints in a scheduled manner, improving performance without extra parameters or data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive fine-tuning disrupts pretrained priors in Vision-Language-Action models, harming generalization. Existing solutions either overconstrain adaptation or ignore component roles.

Method: MAPS linearly schedules relaxation of proximity constraints, allowing visual encoders to retain pretrained priors while action-oriented layers adapt freely.

Result: MAPS boosts in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by up to 30% across benchmarks and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: Empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs preserves generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer, making MAPS a robust fine-tuning solution.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models inherit strong priors from pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but naive fine-tuning often disrupts these representations and harms generalization. Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer.

*Jihan Yao,Achin Kulshrestha,Nathalie Rauschmayr,Reed Roberts,Banghua Zhu,Yulia Tsvetkov,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Representation Probing (LRP) to improve abstention accuracy in VLMs by analyzing internal representations, showing a 7.6% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs need reliable abstention mechanisms for safety-critical applications like STVQA, especially to avoid OCR errors. Existing methods are flawed, suggesting uncertainty signals might lie in internal representations.

Method: Proposes LRP, which trains lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns using three designs: concatenating representations, aggregating attention, or ensembling single-layer probes.

Result: LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6% across four benchmarks, with probes generalizing well and optimal signals found in intermediate layers.

Conclusion: LRP provides a principled framework for detecting confidence signals internally, making VLMs more reliable for deployment.

Abstract: As VLMs are deployed in safety-critical applications, their ability to abstain from answering when uncertain becomes crucial for reliability, especially in Scene Text Visual Question Answering (STVQA) tasks. For example, OCR errors like misreading "50 mph" as "60 mph" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.
  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.

*Yuefei Chen,Jiang Liu,Xiaodong Lin,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates VLMs' counterfactual reasoning in videos, introduces CounterVQA benchmark, and proposes CFGPT to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack robust counterfactual reasoning for videos, which is crucial for deeper understanding beyond observed patterns.

Method: Introduces CounterVQA benchmark with three difficulty levels and CFGPT, a post-training method leveraging language modality.

Result: Existing models perform well on simple counterfactual questions but struggle with complex causal chains; CFGPT improves results.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning is underexplored in VLMs, and CFGPT enhances this capability effectively.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown significant advancements in video understanding, especially in feature alignment, event reasoning, and instruction-following tasks. However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels. Dataset and code will be further released.

TL;DR: ReDirector is a camera-controlled video retake method that fixes RoPE misuse, introduces Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE), and improves dynamic object localization and background preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misuse of RoPE in prior works and enhance video retake generation by aligning spatiotemporal positions and integrating multi-view relationships.

Method: Uses Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE) to phase-shift RoPE with camera conditions, enabling generalization to varied camera trajectories and video lengths.

Result: Achieves better camera controllability, geometric consistency, and video quality across diverse trajectories and lengths.

Conclusion: ReDirector significantly improves video retake generation by aligning camera conditions and enhancing dynamic and static elements.

Abstract: We present ReDirector, a novel camera-controlled video retake generation method for dynamically captured variable-length videos. In particular, we rectify a common misuse of RoPE in previous works by aligning the spatiotemporal positions of the input video and the target retake. Moreover, we introduce Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE), a camera-conditioned RoPE phase shift that captures and integrates multi-view relationships within and across the input and target videos. By integrating camera conditions into RoPE, our method generalizes to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths, yielding improved dynamic object localization and static background preservation. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements in camera controllability, geometric consistency, and video quality across various trajectories and lengths.

TL;DR: BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework, enhances Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome diagnosis by integrating domain-specific knowledge and clinical precedents with Multimodal Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning struggles with limited clinical samples and low inter-class differentiation in Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs), and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) risk hallucinations due to lack of domain-specific knowledge.

Method: BHD-RAG combines DCLD-specific expertise with MLLMs through (1) generating CT image descriptions, (2) retrieving relevant image-description pairs, and (3) synthesizing evidence for diagnosis.

Result: Validated on a dataset of four DCLD types, BHD-RAG achieves superior accuracy and produces evidence-based descriptions matching expert insights.

Conclusion: BHD-RAG effectively improves diagnostic accuracy for rare diseases by leveraging multimodal retrieval and domain knowledge.

Abstract: Deep learning methods face dual challenges of limited clinical samples and low inter-class differentiation among Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs) in advancing Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) diagnosis via Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate diagnostic potential fo such rare diseases, the absence of domain-specific knowledge and referable radiological features intensify hallucination risks. To address this problem, we propose BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy. BHDRAG employs: (1) a specialized agent generating imaging manifestation descriptions of CT images to construct a multimodal corpus of DCLDs cases. (2) a cosine similarity-based retriever pinpointing relevant imagedescription pairs for query images, and (3) an MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis. BHD-RAG is validated on the dataset involving four types of DCLDs, achieving superior accuracy and generating evidence-based descriptions closely aligned with expert insights.

### [49] [Rectified SpaAttn: Revisiting Attention Sparsity for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19835)
*Xuewen Liu,Zhikai Li,Jing Zhang,Mengjuan Chen,Qingyi Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified SpaAttn improves attention sparsity in Diffusion Transformers by correcting biases in attention allocation, achieving speedups without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention sparsity methods suffer from performance degradation due to systematic biases in attention allocation, such as amplified weights for critical tokens and neglected weights for non-critical tokens.

Method: Rectified SpaAttn addresses these biases by using implicit full attention reference. It employs Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation for critical tokens and Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification for non-critical tokens, integrating these with customized Triton kernels.

Result: The method achieves up to 3.33x and 2.08x speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1 benchmarks while maintaining high generation quality.

Conclusion: Rectified SpaAttn effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, offering a practical solution for attention sparsity in video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers dominate video generation, but the quadratic complexity of attention computation introduces substantial latency. Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality. We release Rectified SpaAttn as open-source at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn .

*Yiting Lu,Wei Luo,Peiyan Tu,Haoran Li,Hanxin Zhu,Zihao Yu,Xingrui Wang,Xinyi Chen,Xinge Peng,Xin Li,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The abstract introduces 4DWorldBench, a unified benchmark for evaluating World Generation Models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. It integrates adaptive conditioning and multimodal evaluation methods to improve alignment and coherence assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack unified evaluation standards for world-realism capability in World Models, prompting the need for a systematic benchmark like 4DWorldBench.

Method: 4DWorldBench evaluates models across multiple tasks (Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D) using adaptive conditioning across modalities. It maps modality conditions into textual space and employs LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and network-based methods.

Result: The benchmark provides comprehensive and consistent evaluation, with preliminary human studies validating its alignment with subjective judgments.

Conclusion: 4DWorldBench aims to standardize evaluations and accelerate advancements in world generation, bridging the gap from visual to world generation.

Abstract: World Generation Models are emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation multimodal intelligence systems. Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from "visual generation" to "world generation."

### [51] [Face, Whole-Person, and Object Classification in a Unified Space Via The Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19846)
*Thomas M Metz,Matthew Q Hill,Alice J O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC) to fine-tune vision foundation models for four tasks (object recognition, face/person recognition) without catastrophic forgetting, achieving high accuracy and feature sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models excel in zero-shot object classification but suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned for specific tasks like face/person recognition. The goal is to enable multi-task learning without forgetting.

Method: Proposes IMIC, a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule to fine-tune foundation models (DINOv3, CLIP, EVA-02) simultaneously on four tasks in a single embedding space.

Result: IMIC works effectively with EVA-02 and CLIP, matching domain experts' performance on all tasks and outperforming humans in multi-tasking. The method maintains out-of-distribution generalization and shows linearly separable but feature-shared representations.

Conclusion: IMIC enables multi-task learning without catastrophic forgetting, preserving foundation model properties while achieving high accuracy. Feature sharing across tasks is substantial, with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Vision foundation models can perform generalized object classification in zero-shot mode, and face/person recognition when they are fine-tuned. However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks. Fewer than 100 PCs calculated from any one task could perform all other tasks with nearly zero performance degradation.

*Jiahui Sun,Junran Lu,Jinhui Yin,Yishuo Xu,Yuanqi Li,Yanwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOGE, a framework for extracting road networks from aerial imagery using Bézier Graphs, eliminating the need for vector ground-truth by reframing the task as a global optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on polylines, which struggle with curvilinear geometry. The paper argues roads are inherently curve-based and proposes a solution.

Method: DOGE learns Bézier Graphs from segmentation masks using two modules: DiffAlign (optimizes geometry) and TopoAdapt (refines topology).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SpaceNet and CityScale benchmarks.

Conclusion: DOGE presents a new paradigm for high-fidelity vector maps of road networks.

Abstract: Automatic extraction of road networks from aerial imagery is a fundamental task, yet prevailing methods rely on polylines that struggle to model curvilinear geometry. We maintain that road geometry is inherently curve-based and introduce the Bézier Graph, a differentiable parametric curve-based representation. The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT). We sidestep this bottleneck by reframing the task as a global optimization problem over the Bézier Graph. Our framework, DOGE, operationalizes this paradigm by learning a parametric Bézier Graph directly from segmentation masks, eliminating the need for curve GT. DOGE holistically optimizes the graph by alternating between two complementary modules: DiffAlign continuously optimizes geometry via differentiable rendering, while TopoAdapt uses discrete operators to refine its topology. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale SpaceNet and CityScale benchmarks, presenting a new paradigm for generating high-fidelity vector maps of road networks. We will release our code and related data.

*Jiankuo Zhao,Xiangyu Zhu,Zidu Wang,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAvatar, a new method for creating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from monocular videos, addresses limitations like rigid motion and occlusion handling by introducing UV-Adaptive Soft Binding and Temporal ADC strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting produce rigid motion and struggle with occluded regions. STAvatar aims to improve flexibility and detail capture.

Method: STAvatar uses UV-Adaptive Soft Binding for dynamic resampling and Temporal ADC for targeted densification in detailed regions.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks in fine detail capture and occlusion handling.

Conclusion: STAvatar provides a robust solution for creating expressive and detailed 3D head avatars.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity and animatable 3D head avatars from monocular videos remains a challenging yet essential task. Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions. The code will be publicly available.

*Xiangkai Ma,Han Zhang,Wenzhong Li,Sanglu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeArtist introduces a semantic-level alignment between time series and visual concepts, enabling high-quality image generation from non-visual sequential data while capturing temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack semantic-level alignment for temporal forecasting and image generation from non-visual sequential data.

Method: TimeArtist uses a 'warmup-align' paradigm with self-supervised training of dual-autoencoders and a shared quantizer, followed by a projection layer for alignment.

Result: Achieves high performance in image generation metrics and excels in zero-shot temporal tasks.

Conclusion: TimeArtist bridges the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics, setting a new cross-modal generation paradigm.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in aligning and generating content across text and image modalities. However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, existing methods that convert series into "pseudo-images" for temporal forecasting fail to establish semantic-level alignment. In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a "warmup-align" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer. Extensive experiments show that TimeArtist achieves satisfactory performance in image generation metrics, while also attaining superior results in zero-shot temporal tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal generation, bridging the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics.

Conclusion: GigaWorld-0 enables scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data, improving generalization and task success for physical robots.

Abstract: World models are emerging as a foundational paradigm for scalable, data-efficient embodied AI. In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.

TL;DR: ChessMamba is a novel framework for change detection in multitemporal remote sensing imagery, addressing challenges like heterogeneity and spatiotemporal misalignment through interleaved state-space modeling and structure-aware fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization.

Method: ChessMamba uses a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order and structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks show ChessMamba achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and improves change detection accuracy.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) in multitemporal remote sensing imagery presents significant challenges for fine-grained recognition, owing to heterogeneity and spatiotemporal misalignment. However, existing methodologies based on vision transformers or state-space models typically disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization. To address this, we introduce ChessMamba, a structure-aware framework leveraging interleaved state-space modeling for robust CD with multi-temporal inputs. ChessMamba integrates a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring two key innovations: (i) Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order, which serializes multi-temporal features into a unified sequence within a single forward pass, thereby shortening interaction paths and enabling direct comparison for accurate change localization; and (ii) Structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions, selectively capturing center-and-corner neighborhood contexts within each mono-temporal. Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks, including binary CD, semantic CD and multimodal building damage assessment, demonstrate that ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.The relevant code will be available at: github.com/DingLei14/ChessMamba.

TL;DR: Proposes frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation (FD-CMKD) to improve knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD struggles in cross-modal scenarios due to inconsistent representations. This paper addresses the challenge by focusing on frequency-domain features.

Method: Decouples knowledge transfer into low-frequency (strong alignment) and high-frequency (relaxed alignment) components. Introduces scale consistency loss and a shared classifier.

Result: Outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: FD-CMKD effectively addresses cross-modal KD challenges by leveraging frequency features and alignment strategies.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has proven highly effective for compressing large models and enhancing the performance of smaller ones. However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for CAD technology are limited to single tasks, hindering its development. LiMT aims to explore task correlations and reduce dataset heterogeneity.

Method: The dataset includes 150 CT volumes with four liver disease types and normal cases, annotated by clinicians, supporting multi-task learning.

Result: LiMT provides baseline results and reviews existing liver-related datasets and methods, offering a resource for medical imaging research.

Conclusion: LiMT is a valuable public dataset for advancing multi-task CAD technology in liver lesion evaluation and treatment.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology can assist clinicians in evaluating liver lesions and intervening with treatment in time. Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LVLMs struggle with SVQA due to lack of quality datasets, exacerbated by systematic errors in synthesized QA pairs from existing methods.

Method: Proposes a Generate-then-Verify framework: generates QA pairs with figure context, then applies cross-modal checks and filters to remove errors.

Result: Curates VeriSciQA (20,351 QA pairs), showing accuracy gaps (64% vs. 82%) between open-source and proprietary models, and scaling improvements on benchmarks.

Conclusion: VeriSciQA's scalable framework advances SVQA capabilities, with potential for further enhancements through continued data expansion.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for scientific applications, yet open-source models still struggle with Scientific Visual Question Answering (SVQA), namely answering questions about figures from scientific papers. A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%). Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets. Human evaluation further validates the superior correctness of VeriSciQA. Together, these evidences demonstrate that continued data expansion by our scalable framework can further advance SVQA capability in the open-source community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of human-annotated supervision and text-based self-evaluation in vision-language agents.

Method: Integrates tool usage into reasoning, self-evaluation, and self-repair, featuring Solver and Verifier roles interacting via a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle.

Result: Achieves a 12.5% improvement over the base model in tasks like geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis.

Conclusion: Agent0-VL demonstrates stable self-improvement through tool-grounded critique and reinforcement learning, eliminating the need for external rewards.

Abstract: Vision-language agents have achieved remarkable progress in a variety of multimodal reasoning tasks; however, their learning remains constrained by the limitations of human-annotated supervision. Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal approach for recognizing continuous ASL signs using skeletal features and handshape information, improving segmentation and recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance continuous sign recognition by accurately detecting sign boundaries and leveraging multimodal data (skeletal and handshape features) for robustness.

Method: The method involves using 3D skeletal features for sign segmentation, pretraining a handshape classifier, and fusing modalities to improve boundary detection and recognition.

Result: The approach shows significant improvements over previous work when evaluated on the ASLLRP corpus.

Conclusion: The multimodal fusion of skeletal and handshape features effectively enhances continuous sign recognition accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal approach for continuous sign recognition that first uses machine learning to detect the start and end frames of signs in videos of American Sign Language (ASL) sentences, and then recognizes the segmented signs. For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects. We evaluate our method on the ASLLRP corpus and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work.

*Haoxuan Wang,Jiachen Tao,Junyi Wu,Gaowen Liu,Ramana Rao Kompella,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion Marionette is a zero-shot framework for transferring rigid motion from videos to images using a shared spatial-temporal prior, avoiding trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely on external priors (geometric, generative, or simulation) that introduce constraints, limiting generalizability and temporal consistency.

Method: The framework lifts source videos and target images into a unified 3D space, extracts motion trajectories, and constructs a SpaT prior. This prior integrates with the target object to synthesize a refined velocity field for video production.

Result: Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, ensures temporal consistency, aligns with source motion, and supports controllable video generation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages internal spatial-temporal priors to overcome limitations of external priors, enabling efficient and flexible motion transfer.

Abstract: We present Motion Marionette, a zero-shot framework for rigid motion transfer from monocular source videos to single-view target images. Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation.

TL;DR: Reasoning-VLA improves autonomous driving by combining learnable action queries with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features for efficient and generalizable decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models lack efficiency and struggle with generalization to new configurations and scenarios.

Method: Uses learnable action queries initialized via Gaussian sampling, interacts with reasoning-enhanced features for parallel action generation, and trains on a consolidated dataset with Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization, and fast inference speed.

Conclusion: Reasoning-VLA is a robust and efficient framework for autonomous driving decision-making.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong decision-making capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.

TL;DR: A framework predicting photochemical conversion in 3D-printed objects using a novel multimodal fusion architecture (C-PGA) that models physical coupling to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict dense, non-visual volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data, addressing limitations of conventional vision models in handling coupled optical and material physics.

Method: Introduces Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), which uses sparse parameters to dynamically gate and adapt dense visual features via FiLM, leveraging dual 3D visual streams processed by parallel 3D-CNNs.

Result: Enables precise virtual chemical characterisation without traditional post-print measurements, offering breakthrough control over chemical conversion.

Conclusion: C-PGA provides a novel and effective solution for predicting photochemical conversion in complex 3D-printed objects, advancing computer vision capabilities.

Abstract: We present a framework that pioneers the prediction of photochemical conversion in complex three-dimensionally printed objects, introducing a challenging new computer vision task: predicting dense, non-visual volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data. This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context. This approach offers a breakthrough in virtual chemical characterisation, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements and enabling precise control over the chemical conversion state.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoTTS introduces localized test-time scaling (TTS) to adaptively resample defective image regions, reducing computation while improving quality by focusing on problematic areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, wasting computation on satisfactory regions and inadequately addressing localized defects. Localized TTS aims to optimize resource use by targeting only defective areas.

Method: LoTTS localizes defects using cross- and self-attention signals with quality-aware prompts, refines these into coherent masks, and perturbs only defective regions while preserving global consistency through localized denoising.

Result: Experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX show LoTTS improves local quality and global fidelity while reducing GPU costs by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling.

Conclusion: Localized TTS is a promising approach for scaling diffusion models efficiently at inference time, balancing quality improvements with computational savings.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the dominant paradigm in text-to-image generation, and test-time scaling (TTS) further improves quality by allocating more computation during inference. However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling. These findings establish localized TTS as a promising new direction for scaling diffusion models at inference time.

TL;DR: HybriDLA is a generative framework combining diffusion and autoregressive decoding for document layout analysis, achieving 83.5% mAP on modern documents with diverse layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with modern documents' varied layouts and element counts, prompting the need for a flexible solution.

Method: Unifies diffusion (refining bounding boxes) and autoregressive decoding (adding semantic context) in a single layer, supported by a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder.

Result: Achieves 83.5% mAP, outperforming prior approaches on benchmarks like DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc.

Conclusion: HybriDLA sets a new state-of-the-art for document layout analysis and will be publicly available.

Abstract: Conventional document layout analysis (DLA) traditionally depends on empirical priors or a fixed set of learnable queries executed in a single forward pass. While sufficient for early-generation documents with a small, predetermined number of regions, this paradigm struggles with contemporary documents, which exhibit diverse element counts and increasingly complex layouts. To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues. This architecture elevates performance to 83.5% mean Average Precision (mAP). Extensive experiments on the DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc benchmarks demonstrate that HybriDLA sets a state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous approaches. All data and models will be made publicly available at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/HybriDLA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DetVLM combines object detection and Visual Large Models (VLMs) for fine-grained image retrieval, enabling state-specific and zero-shot searches with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack robustness, spatial grounding, or efficiency for fine-grained retrieval tasks.

Method: DetVLM uses a two-stage pipeline: YOLO for component screening and VLM for recall enhancement and state/zero-shot verification.

Result: Achieves 94.82% retrieval accuracy, 94.95% in zero-shot tasks, and over 90% in state searches.

Conclusion: DetVLM outperforms baselines, offering efficient and accurate fine-grained retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Fine-grained image retrieval, which aims to find images containing specific object components and assess their detailed states, is critical in fields like security and industrial inspection. However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., "sun visor lowered"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., "driver wearing a mask") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines. It also attains 94.95\% accuracy in zero-shot search for driver mask-wearing and over 90\% average accuracy in state search tasks.

TL;DR: CPDATrack is a novel tracking framework that suppresses background and distractor interference while enhancing efficiency through token pruning and selective attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-stream Transformer trackers suffer from excessive background token interference and loss of contextual information due to token pruning methods.

Method: CPDATrack integrates a learnable module to estimate target association probabilities, prunes less-informative tokens, and uses selective attention mechanisms.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably 75.1% average overlap on GOT-10k benchmark.

Conclusion: CPDATrack effectively addresses interference and efficiency issues in tracking, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: One-stream Transformer-based trackers have demonstrated remarkable performance by concatenating template and search region tokens, thereby enabling joint attention across all tokens. However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens. The proposed CPDATrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly on GOT-10k, where it attains an average overlap of 75.1 percent.

Motivation: Explore diffusion models' semantic structures for tasks beyond image generation, focusing on recognition and localization.

Method: Reinterpret self-attention maps as semantic label propagation kernels; extend to temporal kernels for zero-shot tracking. Use DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting for robustness.

Result: DRIFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on video object segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diffusion models' self-attention maps are versatile for semantic tasks, with DRIFT demonstrating effective zero-shot tracking.

Abstract: Image diffusion models, though originally developed for image generation, implicitly capture rich semantic structures that enable various recognition and localization tasks beyond synthesis. In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.

Motivation: High-resolution content creation is a critical challenge in vision and graphics, but existing methods are limited to low resolutions (up to 1K). The work aims to enable effective, controllable editing for higher resolutions.

Method: The framework includes patch-wise optimization on source images, a fine-grained detail transfer module, and a novel synchronization strategy to ensure patch consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's ability to produce high-quality edits, advancing high-resolution content creation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses high-resolution image editing, paving the way for improved visual content generation.

Abstract: High-resolution content creation is rapidly emerging as a central challenge in both the vision and graphics communities. While images serve as the most fundamental modality for visual expression, content generation that aligns with the user intent requires effective, controllable high-resolution image manipulation mechanisms. However, existing approaches remain limited to low-resolution settings, typically supporting only up to 1K resolution. In this work, we introduce the task of high-resolution image editing and propose a test-time optimization framework to address it. Our method performs patch-wise optimization on high-resolution source images, followed by a fine-grained detail transfer module and a novel synchronization strategy to maintain consistency across patches. Extensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality edits, facilitating the way toward high-resolution content creation.

Motivation: Existing methods require dense supervision and costly fine-tuning; SPROUT aims to eliminate these dependencies.

Result: SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPROUT sets a new paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology.

Abstract: Accurate nuclear instance segmentation is a pivotal task in computational pathology, supporting data-driven clinical insights and facilitating downstream translational applications. While large vision foundation models have shown promise for zero-shot biomedical segmentation, most existing approaches still depend on dense supervision and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Consequently, training-free methods present a compelling research direction, yet remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks demonstrate that SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining, establishing a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology.

Motivation: 3D face recognition faces privacy risks despite its robustness to spoofing and environmental variations. Protecting biometric templates is crucial for high-security applications.

Result: Achieves high recognition accuracy on BU-3DFE and FaceScape datasets with strong resilience to reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: GFT-GCN successfully balances privacy and performance, providing a secure solution for 3D face authentication.

Abstract: 3D face recognition offers a robust biometric solution by capturing facial geometry, providing resilience to variations in illumination, pose changes, and presentation attacks. Its strong spoof resistance makes it suitable for high-security applications, but protecting stored biometric templates remains critical. We present GFT-GCN, a privacy-preserving 3D face recognition framework that combines spectral graph learning with diffusion-based template protection. Our approach integrates the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to extract compact, discriminative spectral features from 3D face meshes. To secure these features, we introduce a spectral diffusion mechanism that produces irreversible, renewable, and unlinkable templates. A lightweight client-server architecture ensures that raw biometric data never leaves the client device. Experiments on the BU-3DFE and FaceScape datasets demonstrate high recognition accuracy and strong resistance to reconstruction attacks. Results show that GFT-GCN effectively balances privacy and performance, offering a practical solution for secure 3D face authentication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a truly input-size agnostic visual encoder, addressing limitations of previous Mamba-based vision encoders by preserving causality and enabling adaptability to arbitrary resolutions.

Method: Utilizes a unidirectional Mamba2 backbone with relative move embedding for translation invariance and introduces a diffusion-inspired loss for dense supervision.

Result: Demonstrates robust performance across resolutions, especially at high resolutions like 1536² on ImageNet-1K, with linear time and memory complexity.

Conclusion: MambaEye successfully addresses input-size agnosticism in visual encoders, maintaining efficiency and performance across varying resolutions.

Abstract: Despite decades of progress, a truly input-size agnostic visual encoder-a fundamental characteristic of human vision-has remained elusive. We address this limitation by proposing \textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a novel diffusion-inspired loss function that provides dense, step-wise supervision, training the model to build confidence as it gathers more visual evidence. We demonstrate that MambaEye exhibits robust performance across a wide range of image resolutions, especially at higher resolutions such as $1536^2$ on the ImageNet-1K classification task. This feat is achieved while maintaining linear time and memory complexity relative to the number of patches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchies, leading to concept omission and poor compositionality.

Method: HiCoGen decomposes prompts using LLMs, iteratively synthesizes images with visual context, and optimizes the process with RL and a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule.

Result: HiCoGen outperforms existing methods in concept coverage and compositional accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations in handling complex prompts, improving generative performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capability in generating high-quality images for simple prompts. However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels. We also construct HiCoPrompt, a new text-to-image benchmark with hierarchical prompts for rigorous evaluation. Experiments show our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both concept coverage and compositional accuracy.

TL;DR: VGGT4D extends VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction without training, leveraging global attention cues for dynamic element separation and achieving high performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in disentangling dynamic objects from static backgrounds in 4D scenes motivate leveraging VGGT's implicit dynamic cues for robust reconstruction without additional training.

Method: Dynamic cues are mined via gram similarity and aggregated temporally; masks are refined with projection gradient and integrated early in VGGT's inference to mitigate motion interference.

Result: Superior performance in dynamic segmentation, pose estimation, and dense reconstruction across six datasets, with support for long sequences (>500 frames).

Conclusion: VGGT4D effectively extends VGGT for 4D reconstruction, demonstrating robustness and scalability without requiring fine-tuning or heavy optimization.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 4D scenes is challenging, as it requires robust disentanglement of dynamic objects from the static background. While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. It also supports single-pass inference on sequences longer than 500 frames.

TL;DR: The paper explores how RLVR affects input activations in LMMs, showing it shifts low-entropy activations more than high-entropy ones, linking this to improved reasoning. It introduces Activation Replay, a training-free method to enhance reasoning by replaying low-entropy activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand RLVR's impact on LMMs and improve their reasoning capabilities without costly retraining.

Method: Using logit lens analysis, the paper investigates RLVR's effects on activations and proposes Activation Replay, which manipulates visual tokens at test time.

Result: Activation Replay boosts reasoning in diverse tasks, improves Pass@K, and mitigates narrow reasoning coverage of RLVR.

Conclusion: The proposed Activation Replay is a simple, effective method to enhance LMM reasoning, outperforming alternative approaches.

Abstract: Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach to incentivizing reasoning capability in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), while the underlying mechanisms behind this post-training paradigm are poorly understood. We begin by exploring how input activations are affected by RLVR through the perspective of logit lens. Our systematic investigations across multiple post-trained LMMs suggest that RLVR shifts low-entropy activations unexpectedly, while high-entropy ones are less affected. We further demonstrate that such phenomena are associated with LMM reasoning by controlled experiments, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of modulating low-entropy activations. To this end, we propose Activation Replay, a novel simple yet effective training-free approach that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs without requiring expensive policy optimization. Our design involves manipulation of visual tokens at test time, replaying low-entropy activations from the input context of base LMMs to regulating the RLVR counterparts. Activation Replay triggers better reasoning across diverse scenarios, including mathematics, o3-like visual agents, and video reasoning. We further show that Activation Replay boosts Pass@K and mitigates narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR. Our design is compared against alternative choices, such as replaying high-entropy activations instead of low-entropy ones, or direct cross-model intervention instead of manipulating input tokens, demonstrating the superiority of our implementation. Codes will be made publicly available.

### [77] [EmoFeedback2: Reinforcement of Continuous Emotional Image Generation via LVLM-based Reward and Textual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19982)
*Jingyang Jia,Kai Shu,Gang Yang,Long Xing,Xun Chen,Aiping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmoFeedback2, a reinforcement paradigm leveraging LVLM for continuous emotional image generation, improving emotional continuity and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack emotional feedback and adaptive emotional prompt adjustment, leading to poor control of emotional continuity and fidelity.

Method: EmoFeedback2 uses LVLM for reward and textual feedback, guiding generative model fine-tuning and refining prompts iteratively.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, generating high-quality images with desired emotions.

Conclusion: EmoFeedback2 effectively addresses limitations in continuous emotional image generation, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Continuous emotional image generation (C-EICG) is emerging rapidly due to its ability to produce images aligned with both user descriptions and continuous emotional values. However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset. The code and dataset will be released soon.

*Seungyeon Baek,Erqun Dong,Shadan Namazifard,Mark J. Matthews,Kwang Moo Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel training-free inpainting method optimizes initial seed noise to match unmasked data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of guidance-based methods for inpainting with generic text-to-image models necessitate specialized models, prompting a search for effective training-free solutions.

Method: Optimizes initial seed noise to match unmasked data using linear approximation and spectral domain optimization, followed by conventional training-free inpainting.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on various tasks, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully enables training-free inpainting with off-the-shelf models by optimizing initial noise, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free method for inpainting with off-the-shelf text-to-image models. While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art. Project page: https://ubc-vision.github.io/sonic/

*Farhaan Ebadulla,Chiraag Mudlpaur,Shreya Chaurasia,Gaurav BV*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal VR gaze prediction method combining gaze history, head movement, and scene content, improving accuracy with cross-modal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting gaze behavior in VR is challenging but crucial for optimizing rendering and interface design, reducing reliance on costly eye-tracking hardware.

Method: A multimodal approach using gated fusion and cross-modal attention integrates gaze patterns, head movements, and scene data for adaptive prediction.

Result: The method outperforms single-modality predictions, achieving 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in gaze trajectory predictions.

Conclusion: The approach enhances VR gaze prediction, offering applications in rendering, interaction design, and user experience evaluation.

Abstract: Predicting gaze behavior in virtual reality environments remains a significant challenge with implications for rendering optimization and interface design. This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories. These findings contribute to understanding attention mechanisms in virtual environments while suggesting potential applications in rendering optimization, interaction design, and user experience evaluation. The approach represents a step toward more efficient virtual reality systems that can anticipate user attention patterns without requiring expensive eye tracking hardware.

*Yaoli Liu,Ziheng Ouyang,Shengtao Lou,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a detail-aware refinement framework (“ourMthd”) for reference-guided image generation, addressing the loss of fine-grained details in current diffusion models by using a two-stage reference-driven correction process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lose fine-grained visual details when refining images using references due to VAE-based latent compression and inconsistent post-editing results.

Method: The framework performs two stages: globally coherent refinement via fine-tuning a single-image diffusion editor, and localized editing enhancement using reinforcement learning.

Result: “ourMthd” improves reference alignment and detail preservation, outperforming open-source and commercial models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively preserves fine-grained details and ensures visual coherence in reference-guided image generation.

Abstract: Reference-guided image generation has progressed rapidly, yet current diffusion models still struggle to preserve fine-grained visual details when refining a generated image using a reference. This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.

*Jiyeon Han,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang,Haedong Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CREward is a type-specific creativity reward model spanning geometry, material, and texture axes, trained using human benchmarks and LVLM-generated labels for evaluating and generating creative images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat creativity as a single quantity, which is limiting. This work aims to represent and assess creativity more granularly through specific types (geometry, material, texture) aligned with human perception.

Method: Human benchmark evaluations capture creativity perceptions, and LVLM predictions validate alignment with humans. LVLM-generated labels train CREward for creativity assessment, explainability, and creative generation.

Result: CREward successfully models creativity across three axes, aligns with human judgments, and enables applications like creativity assessment and guided generation.

Conclusion: CREward advances creativity modeling by integrating human perception and LVLM insights, offering practical tools for evaluation and creative applications.

Abstract: Creativity is a complex phenomenon. When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes," geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images. We then analyze the correlation between human judgments and predictions by large vision-language models (LVLMs), confirming that LVLMs exhibit strong alignment with human perception. Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images. We explore three applications of CREward: creativity assessment, explainable creativity, and creative sample acquisition for both human design inspiration and guiding creative generation through low-rank adaptation.

### [82] [On the Feasibility of Hijacking MLLMs' Decision Chain via One Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20002)
*Changyue Li,Jiaying Li,Youliang Yuan,Jiaming He,Zhicong Huang,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs) to hijack sequential decisions in neural networks, showing practical threats with a 70% success rate on multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adversarial attacks target single decisions, but cascading errors in sequential decision-making pose greater risks. This work aims to expose and address this overlooked threat.

Method: SAUPs manipulate inputs based on semantics, using an algorithm that searches in normalized space with semantic separation. The RIST dataset aids evaluation.

Result: Experiments on multimodal models show SAUPs achieve a 70% success rate in controlling five distinct targets with a single adversarial frame.

Conclusion: SAUPs reveal significant vulnerabilities in sequential decision-making models, highlighting the need for robust defenses against cascading adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Conventional adversarial attacks focus on manipulating a single decision of neural networks. However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.
  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying "non-motorized lane" signs as "motorized lane" and "pedestrian" as "plastic bag".
  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.

*Yuanzhe Li,Steffen Müller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal fusion network for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions, leveraging seven modalities to integrate complementary cues, validated by superior performance on the JAAD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian crossing intention prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles to enhance safety in urban environments, addressing diverse pedestrian behaviors and contextual dependencies.

Method: The network uses Transformer-based modules to extract motion and visual features, incorporates depth-guided attention for spatial interactions, and employs modality and temporal attention to prioritize important cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on the JAAD dataset confirm the network's effectiveness, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal fusion network successfully integrates diverse features to improve pedestrian intention prediction, advancing autonomous vehicle safety.

Abstract: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban environments. Ideal prediction provides AVs with critical environmental cues, thereby reducing the risk of pedestrian-related collisions. However, the prediction task is challenging due to the diverse nature of pedestrian behavior and its dependence on multiple contextual factors. This paper proposes a multimodal fusion network that leverages seven modality features from both visual and motion branches, aiming to effectively extract and integrate complementary cues across different modalities. Specifically, motion and visual features are extracted from the raw inputs using multiple Transformer-based extraction modules. Depth-guided attention module leverages depth information to guide attention towards salient regions in another modality through comprehensive spatial feature interactions. To account for the varying importance of different modalities and frames, modality attention and temporal attention are designed to selectively emphasize informative modalities and effectively capture temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on the JAAD dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, achieving superior performance compared to the baseline methods.

TL;DR: MFT is a Transformer-based model for pedestrian crossing intention prediction, leveraging multi-context fusion to improve accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian intention prediction is critical for autonomous vehicles to enhance safety and reduce accidents, but existing methods struggle with complex urban environments.

Method: MFT uses progressive fusion: intra-context attention for feature fusion within contexts, cross-context attention for multi-context integration, and guided attention for refined representations.

Result: Achieves 73%, 93%, and 90% accuracy on JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: MFT effectively integrates multi-context data for pedestrian intention prediction, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for autonomous vehicles to improve pedestrian safety and reduce traffic accidents. However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the network architecture and contribution of different input context.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for predicting pedestrian crossing intention, leveraging six visual and motion modalities grouped into three interaction pairs. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting pedestrian crossing intention is vital for autonomous vehicles to avoid collisions, but integrating cues from diverse data types is challenging.

Method: ACIT uses a dual-path attention mechanism for intra-modal and cross-modal interactions within three paired modalities, along with multi-modal fusion and Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation.

Result: ACIT achieves 70% and 89% accuracy on JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ACIT effectively integrates multi-modal data for pedestrian intention prediction, demonstrating superior performance validated through ablation studies.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian crossing intention is crucial for autonomous vehicles to prevent pedestrian-related collisions. However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step. Furthermore, a Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation module is introduced to capture sequential dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ACIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 70% and 89% on the JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the contribution of different modules of ACIT.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Safety-Critical Reasoning for autonomous driving, using multi-view inputs and a new dataset (WaymoQA) to improve MLLMs' ability to handle complex driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of high-level reasoning in safety-critical driving scenarios, where avoiding one risk can create another, requires comprehensive environmental understanding.

Method: Multi-view inputs are used to enhance reasoning. Safety-Critical Reasoning is structured into two stages: immediate risk resolution and downstream risk mitigation. WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 annotated Q&A pairs, is introduced.

Result: Existing MLLMs perform poorly in safety-critical scenarios but improve significantly when fine-tuned with WaymoQA.

Conclusion: WaymoQA effectively enhances MLLMs' reasoning in complex driving scenarios, contributing to safer autonomous driving agents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong understanding of driving scenes, drawing interest in their application to autonomous driving. However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improves their reasoning ability, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset in developing safer and more reasoning-capable driving agents.

*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Chong Feng,Zhixing Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGA improves MLLMs' visual attention by leveraging visual tokens' semantics for precise grounding, reducing hallucinations with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often hallucinate due to limited localization capability in visual attention, despite accurately extracting visual semantics.

Method: VGA constructs precise visual grounding using semantic content of visual tokens, dynamically guiding attention and suppressing redundant regions.

Result: VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance with only 4.36% latency overhead and is compatible with efficient attention methods.

Conclusion: Explicit visual guidance via VGA significantly enhances MLLMs' visual understanding capabilities, mitigating hallucination issues.

Abstract: Visual attention serves as the primary mechanism through which MLLMs interpret visual information; however, its limited localization capability often leads to hallucinations. We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance. Further analysis confirms that explicit visual guidance plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs.

TL;DR: COVec introduces an illumination-aware vectorization framework using intrinsic decomposition for editable, scalable vector images with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to represent complex images semantically concisely, often producing fragmented shapes.

Method: COVec uses intrinsic image decomposition (albedo, shade, light) and semantic-guided initialization with two-stage optimization via differentiable rendering.

Result: COVec outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity and editability across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: COVec advances vectorization by integrating illumination-aware decomposition and semantic guidance for superior results.

Abstract: Image vectorization aims to convert raster images into editable, scalable vector representations while preserving visual fidelity. Existing vectorization methods struggle to represent complex real-world images, often producing fragmented shapes at the cost of semantic conciseness. In this paper, we propose COVec, an illumination-aware vectorization framework inspired by the Clair-Obscur principle of light-shade contrast. COVec is the first to introduce intrinsic image decomposition in the vector domain, separating an image into albedo, shade, and light layers in a unified vector representation. A semantic-guided initialization and two-stage optimization refine these layers with differentiable rendering. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that COVec achieves higher visual fidelity and significantly improved editability compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-based methods for point cloud generation are simple and efficient but often underperform representation-based approaches. MFM-Point aims to bridge this gap.

Method: MFM-Point employs a multi-scale Flow Matching framework with a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, using structured downsampling and upsampling to preserve geometry and alignment.

Result: MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and competes with representation-based methods, excelling in multi-category and high-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: MFM-Point effectively enhances point cloud generation quality and scalability while retaining the simplicity of point-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, point cloud generation has gained significant attention in 3D generative modeling. Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods. In particular, MFM-point demonstrates strong results in multi-category and high-resolution generation tasks.

TL;DR: HACBSR is an unsupervised blind super-resolution framework for planetary images, eliminating the need for ground-truth images or external priors by using contrastive kernel sampling and history-augmented learning. It performs competitively on simulated datasets like Ceres-50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planetary remote sensing images suffer from unknown degradations due to environmental and hardware factors, limiting quality and posing challenges for supervised methods lacking ground-truth data.

Method: HACBSR combines contrastive kernel sampling (to reduce Gaussian bias) and history-augmented contrastive learning (using historical models for negative samples), enabling unsupervised optimization.

Result: HACBSR achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on diverse upscaling factors, validated using the Ceres-50 dataset.

Conclusion: HACBSR offers a novel unsupervised solution for blind super-resolution in planetary imaging, addressing key limitations without relying on ground-truth data.

Abstract: Planetary remote sensing images are affected by diverse and unknown degradations caused by imaging environments and hardware constraints. These factors limit image quality and hinder supervised blind super-resolution due to the lack of ground-truth images. This work presents History-Augmented Contrastive Blind Super-Resolution (HACBSR), an unsupervised framework for blind super-resolution that operates without ground-truth images and external kernel priors. HACBSR comprises two components: (1) a contrastive kernel sampling mechanism with kernel similarity control to mitigate distribution bias from Gaussian sampling, and (2) a history-augmented contrastive learning that uses historical models to generate negative samples to enable less greedy optimization and to induce strong convexity without ground-truth. A convergence analysis of the history-augmented contrastive learning is given in the Appendix. To support evaluation in planetary applications, we introduce Ceres-50, a dataset with diverse geological features simulated degradation patterns. Experiments show that HACBSR achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods across multiple upscaling factors.

TL;DR: DeLight-Mono is a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework designed for endoscopic navigation, addressing uneven illumination issues by decoupling and optimizing illumination-reflectance-depth components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uneven illumination in endoscopic images degrades depth estimation performance, and existing enhancement techniques fail to guide depth networks effectively.

Method: Proposes DeLight-Mono, which uses an illumination-reflectance-depth model and auxiliary networks for decomposition, alongside a self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel losses.

Result: Validated through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on two public datasets.

Conclusion: DeLight-Mono effectively mitigates the impact of uneven illumination on depth estimation in endoscopic images.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation serves as a key task in the development of endoscopic navigation systems. However, performance degradation persists due to uneven illumination inherent in endoscopic images, particularly in low-intensity regions. Existing low-light enhancement techniques fail to effectively guide the depth network. Furthermore, solutions from other fields, like autonomous driving, require well-lit images, making them unsuitable and increasing data collection burdens. To this end, we present DeLight-Mono - a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework with illumination decoupling. Specifically, endoscopic images are represented by a designed illumination-reflectance-depth model, and are decomposed with auxiliary networks. Moreover, a self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel losses leveraging the decoupled components is proposed to mitigate the effects of uneven illumination on depth estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was rigorously verified through extensive comparisons and an ablation study performed on two public datasets.

*Xiaoge Zhang,Zijie Wu,Mingtao Feng,Zichen Geng,Mehwish Nasim,Saeed Anwar,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLaTEC is a frequency-aware point cloud compression model that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, using triplane representations and a frequency-disentangling technique for efficient compression with superior rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality is challenging due to differing contributions of low- and high-frequency components at the same resolution.

Method: FLaTEC employs a frequency-aware mechanism, converts voxelized embeddings into triplane representations, disentangles frequency components, and uses a frequency-based attention mechanism to restore 3D correlation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, outperforming standard codecs by significant margins (78\% and 94\% BD-rate).

Conclusion: FLaTEC effectively compresses point clouds by addressing frequency disparities and offers superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Point cloud compression methods jointly optimize bitrates and reconstruction distortion. However, balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality is difficult because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution. To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points. Our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and outperforms the standard codecs by 78\% and 94\% in BD-rate on both SemanticKITTI and Ford datasets.

*Simon Damm,Jonas Ricker,Henning Petzka,Asja Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRADA introduces a method to detect and attribute AR-generated images using probability ratios, proving effective against multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AR image generation necessitates reliable detection methods to distinguish synthetic from real images, which current work lacks.

Method: PRADA inspects the ratio of conditional to unconditional probabilities in AR token sequences, using threshold-based classification.

Result: The approach effectively detects and attributes AR images across eight class-to-image and four text-to-image models.

Conclusion: PRADA provides a simple, interpretable solution for identifying AR-generated images, addressing a critical gap in detection techniques.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image synthesis. Leveraging the generation principle of large language models, they allow for efficiently generating deceptively real-looking images, further increasing the need for reliable detection methods. However, to date there is a lack of work specifically targeting the detection of images generated by AR image generators. In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function. Our experimental evaluation shows that PRADA is highly effective against eight class-to-image and four text-to-image models.

### [94] [Learning Procedural-aware Video Representations through State-Grounded Hierarchy Unfolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20073)
*Jinghan Zhao,Yifei Huang,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Task-Step-State (TSS) framework to improve procedural-aware video representations by grounding abstract tasks and steps in visually observable states, outperforming baselines on COIN and CrossTask datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align video content with high-level textual descriptions (tasks/steps), but these lack robust alignment with visual details. The paper introduces 'states' to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes TSS framework and progressive pre-training to hierarchically ground tasks/steps in observable states.

Result: Outperforms baselines on task/step recognition and next-step prediction. State supervision and progressive training drive gains.

Conclusion: States anchor procedural semantics in visual data, and progressive training enforces hierarchy, improving performance.

Abstract: Learning procedural-aware video representations is a key step towards building agents that can reason about and execute complex tasks. Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks. Additionally, our progressive pretraining strategy proves more effective than standard joint training, as it better enforces the intended hierarchical structure.

### [95] [Blind Adaptive Local Denoising for CEST Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20081)
*Chu Chen,Aitor Artola,Yang Liu,Se Weon Park,Raymond H. Chan,Jean-Michel Morel,Kannie W. Y. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method is proposed to address noise challenges in CEST MRI, outperforming existing methods in denoising and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI faces challenges like spatially varying noise and heteroscedasticity, which hinder clinical translation and accuracy in quantitative contrast mapping. Traditional denoising methods fail to preserve critical biomedical information.

Method: BALD leverages CEST data's self-similarity for an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform, equalizing noise distributions without prior noise knowledge. It uses a two-stage denoising approach with local SVD decomposition to avoid artifacts.

Result: BALD demonstrated superior performance in denoising metrics and downstream applications like molecular concentration mapping and cancer detection in phantom and in vivo experiments.

Conclusion: BALD effectively addresses noise issues in CEST MRI, improving accuracy and clinical utility without altering critical biomedical signals.

Abstract: Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables molecular-level visualization of low-concentration metabolites by leveraging proton exchange dynamics. However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \textit{in vivo} CEST scans. In these experiments, BALD consistently outperformed state-of-the-art CEST denoisers in both denoising metrics and downstream tasks such as molecular concentration maps estimation and cancer detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CONVAD integrates Concept Bottleneck Models into Visual Anomaly Detection to provide human-interpretable explanations for anomalies, improving interpretability without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of semantically meaningful interpretations in existing VAD models, aiming to bridge the gap between visual explanations and human understanding.

Method: The authors extend Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to VAD, develop a Concept Dataset, enhance CBM architecture for dual explanations, and introduce a pipeline for synthetic anomaly generation.

Result: CONVAD matches traditional VAD performance while offering richer, concept-driven explanations, enhancing interpretability and trust.

Conclusion: The proposed CONVAD framework successfully combines semantic and visual interpretability in VAD, paving the way for more transparent anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: In recent years, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant attention due to its ability to identify anomalous images using only normal images during training. Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.

TL;DR: WPT introduces a World-to-Policy Transfer paradigm for efficient online distillation guided by an end-to-end world model, improving planning performance and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world model approaches suffer from tight runtime coupling or reliance on offline reward signals, causing inefficiencies or hindering optimization.

Method: Developed a trainable reward model to infuse world knowledge into a teacher policy, followed by policy and world reward distillation to transfer reasoning to a lightweight student policy.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and 79.23 driving score (closed-loop), plus 4.9x faster inference speed.

Conclusion: WPT outperforms existing methods in accuracy, safety, and speed, showcasing the benefits of world-to-policy transfer.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in world models, which primarily aim to capture the spatio-temporal correlations between an agent's actions and the evolving environment. However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety. Moreover, the student sustains up to 4.9x faster inference, while retaining most of the gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fire detection methods suffer from missed detections due to inadequate datasets and models tailored for early fire identification.

Method: The authors propose a synthetic dataset for early forest fire detection, generated using game simulators like Red Dead Redemption 2, and combine it with existing images. They evaluate YOLOv7 and detection transformers for image classification and localization.

Result: The synthetic dataset and combined dataset provide a comprehensive resource for early fire detection, enabling comparison of deep learning models like YOLOv7 and detection transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model evaluation framework advance early forest fire detection, addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: There have been many recent developments in the use of Deep Learning Neural Networks for fire detection. In this paper, we explore an early warning system for detection of forest fires. Due to the lack of sizeable datasets and models tuned for this task, existing methods suffer from missed detection. In this work, we first propose a dataset for early identification of forest fires through visual analysis. Unlike existing image corpuses that contain images of wide-spread fire, our dataset consists of multiple instances of smoke plumes and fire that indicates the initiation of fire. We obtained this dataset synthetically by utilising game simulators such as Red Dead Redemption 2. We also combined our dataset with already published images to obtain a more comprehensive set. Finally, we compared image classification and localisation methods on the proposed dataset. More specifically we used YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) and different models of detection transformer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automatic detection of cardiomegaly using advanced imaging and deep learning techniques for better diagnosis.

Method: Combines CNN (Inception V3) with a multi-head attention mechanism to focus on relevant regions in X-ray images, preceded by data collection and preprocessing.

Result: Achieved high performance metrics: accuracy (95.6%), precision (95.2%), recall (96.2%), sensitivity (95.7%), specificity (96.1%), and AUC (96.0%).

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective and clinically significant for diagnosing cardiomegaly, with rigorous evaluation confirming its robustness.

Abstract: The healthcare industry has been revolutionized significantly by novel imaging technologies, not just in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases but also by the visualization of structural abnormalities like cardiomegaly. This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision. This will validate that the model can identify cardiomegaly and will also show the clinical significance of this method. The model has accuracy of 95.6, precision of 95.2, recall of 96.2, sensitivity of 95.7, specificity of 96.1 and an Area Under Curve(AUC) of 96.0 and their respective graphs are plotted for visualisation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LungEvaty is a transformer-based framework predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from LDCT scans without pixel-level annotations, matching state-of-the-art performance using whole-lung inputs and optional AIAG loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable methods are needed for lung cancer risk estimation in large screening datasets, overcoming limitations of existing approaches like reliance on annotations or fragmented analysis.

Method: LungEvaty uses a fully transformer-based framework, processes whole-lung LDCT scans, and incorporates an optional AIAG loss for anatomically focused attention.

Result: Trained on 90,000+ CT scans, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance without region supervision, offering a scalable solution.

Conclusion: LungEvaty provides a simple, data-efficient, open-source framework for lung cancer risk prediction, extensible for future research.

Abstract: Lung cancer risk estimation is gaining increasing importance as more countries introduce population-wide screening programs using low-dose CT (LDCT). As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets. Existing approaches either over-rely on pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability, or analyze the lung in fragments, weakening performance. We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation. The framework offers a simple, data-efficient, and fully open-source solution that provides an extensible foundation for future research in longitudinal and multimodal lung cancer risk prediction.

TL;DR: UltraViCo addresses attention dispersion in video diffusion transformers to improve video length extrapolation, achieving 4x extrapolation and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods fail to generalize beyond training lengths due to periodic repetition and quality degradation, which stem from attention dispersion.

Method: UltraViCo suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window using a constant decay factor, addressing attention dispersion without training.

Result: Achieves 4x extrapolation, improving Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over previous methods, and generalizes to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: UltraViCo effectively addresses attention dispersion, enhancing video length extrapolation and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Despite advances, video diffusion transformers still struggle to generalize beyond their training length, a challenge we term video length extrapolation. We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing.

Motivation: The rapid expansion of PET/CT scanners has outpaced specialist availability, necessitating automated report generation to reduce clinical workload, especially due to unique challenges posed by functional PET imaging.

Method: PETRG-3D is an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework encoding PET and CT volumes separately, incorporating style-adaptive prompts to handle reporting variability. A multi-center lymphoma dataset (PETRG-Lym) and benchmark (AutoPET-RG-Lym) are created.

Result: PETRG-3D outperforms existing methods significantly in natural language (+31.49% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (+8.18% PET-All), demonstrating the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for future PET/CT-specific models, emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and reliable clinical evaluation, with plans to release codes, models, and datasets.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is essential in oncology, yet the rapid expansion of scanners has outpaced the availability of trained specialists, making automated PET/CT report generation (PETRG) increasingly important for reducing clinical workload. Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for future PET/CT-specific models emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and clinically reliable evaluation. Codes, models, and AutoPET-RG-Lym will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching offers faster and flexible generative modeling compared to diffusion models, but current methods still face issues like slow processing or over-smoothed results.

Method: Restora-Flow uses a degradation mask to guide flow matching sampling and incorporates a trajectory correction mechanism for input consistency.

Result: Outperforms diffusion and flow matching-based methods in perceptual quality and processing time on tasks like inpainting, super-resolution, and denoising.

Conclusion: Restora-Flow is an effective, efficient solution for image restoration tasks, leveraging flow matching's advantages.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a promising generative approach that addresses the lengthy sampling times associated with state-of-the-art diffusion models and enables a more flexible trajectory design, while maintaining high-quality image generation. This capability makes it suitable as a generative prior for image restoration tasks. Although current methods leveraging flow models have shown promising results in restoration, some still suffer from long processing times or produce over-smoothed results. To address these challenges, we introduce Restora-Flow, a training-free method that guides flow matching sampling by a degradation mask and incorporates a trajectory correction mechanism to enforce consistency with degraded inputs. We evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets across several image restoration tasks involving a mask-based degradation, i.e., inpainting, super-resolution and denoising. We show superior perceptual quality and processing time compared to diffusion and flow matching-based reference methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates LMMs' ability to ground semantic understanding in visual input, focusing on pinpointing interaction events in videos. Despite naming objects and actions well, models fail to identify precise moments/locations of contact or release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LMMs truly ground their semantic understanding in visual input by testing their ability to locate specific interaction events ('contact' and 'release') in videos.

Method: Used a large-scale dataset with annotated interactions (20K+ videos) and tested two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) on locating events.

Result: Models named objects and actions accurately but consistently failed to identify exact frames or localize interaction events.

Conclusion: LMMs lack perceptual grounding for precise understanding of dynamic scenes, particularly in identifying moments/locations of physical contact.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) show increasing performance in realistic visual tasks for images and, more recently, for videos. For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical exams often have irregular observation intervals, challenging disease progression modeling. Euclidean space models fail to capture nonlinear geometric structures of irregular longitudinal data.

Method: R-TNAG projects sMRI features into manifold space, uses TNODE for continuous latent state evolution, and ARGRU to handle irregular intervals adaptively.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art models in disease prediction and cognitive score regression, showing stability across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates.

Conclusion: R-TNAG enhances predictive accuracy and temporal generalizability, validated across diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: The uncertainty of clinical examinations frequently leads to irregular observation intervals in longitudinal imaging data, posing challenges for modeling disease progression.Most existing imaging-based disease prediction models operate in Euclidean space, which assumes a flat representation of data and fails to fully capture the intrinsic continuity and nonlinear geometric structure of irregularly sampled longitudinal images. To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability. Cross-dataset validation further confirms its robustness and applicability in diverse clinical settings.

Method: The framework uses Masked Action Planning (MAP) to treat future motion as masked sequence completion, with trajectory queries expanded using injected noise. A lightweight world model rolls out future BEV semantics for each trajectory, and semantic losses are computed over multiple modes.

Result: MAP-World matches anchor-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods on NAVSIM, with real-time inference latency.

Conclusion: MAP-World successfully addresses the limitations of traditional planning methods by leveraging multi-modal futures efficiently and without reliance on anchors or reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous driving must handle multiple plausible futures while remaining computationally efficient. Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path. On NAVSIM, our method matches anchor-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods, while avoiding reinforcement learning and maintaining real-time inference latency.

### [107] [OmniAlpha: A Sequence-to-Sequence Framework for Unified Multi-Task RGBA Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20211)
*Hao Yu,Jiabo Zhan,Zile Wang,Jinglin Wang,Huaisong Zhang,Hongyu Li,Xinrui Chen,Yongxian Wei,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAlpha is a unified, multi-task generative framework for RGBA image generation and editing, outperforming specialized models with its novel architecture and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap between RGB synthesis and RGBA manipulation by proposing a versatile solution.

Method: Introduces OmniAlpha with MSRoPE-BiL for DiT backbone and AlphaLayers dataset, trained on 21 diverse tasks.

Result: Achieves 84.8% reduction in SAD for matting and 90% human preference in layer completion, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Unified multi-task models can excel in RGBA tasks, paving the way for advanced layer-aware generative systems.

Abstract: Generative models have excelled in RGB synthesis, but real-world applications require RGBA manipulation. This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion. Our work proves that a unified, multi-task model can learn a superior shared representation for RGBA, paving the way for more powerful, layer-aware generative systems.

*Ziqi Wang,Chang Che,Qi Wang,Hui Ma,Zenglin Shi,Cees G. M. Snoek,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HPA is a post-training framework for safety-aligned MLLMs that balances safety and task performance during continual adaptation, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVIT studies overlook safety alignment in MLLMs, risking degraded safety during continual adaptation. Addressing this imbalance is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: HPA uses focusing-based parameter partition, balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment to mitigate forgetting and preserve safety.

Result: HPA maintains high safety and reduces forgetting better than baselines, validated on CVIT benchmark and safety datasets.

Conclusion: HPA effectively balances safety and task performance in continual adaptation, offering a robust solution for safety-aligned MLLMs.

Abstract: While continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) has shown promise in adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs), existing studies predominantly focus on models without safety alignment. This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets demonstrate that HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting than existing baselines.

*Daniel Kienzle,Katja Ludwig,Julian Lorenz,Shin'ichi Satoh,Rainer Lienhart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline improves 3D motion tracking of table tennis balls in real-world videos by separating perception and uplifting tasks, using synthetic data for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods trained on synthetic data fail in real-world scenarios due to lack of 3D ground truth and noisy detections. Addressing this improves accuracy.

Method: Proposes a two-stage pipeline: front-end perception trains on 2D data (TTHQ dataset), while back-end uplifting uses synthetic data for robustness against real-world artifacts like missing detections and frame rate variations.

Result: The method transforms a basic uplifting technique into a practical, robust end-to-end solution for 3D trajectory and spin analysis.

Conclusion: Separating perception and uplifting tasks, combined with synthetic data training, enhances real-world performance for table tennis motion tracking.

Abstract: Obtaining the precise 3D motion of a table tennis ball from standard monocular videos is a challenging problem, as existing methods trained on synthetic data struggle to generalize to the noisy, imperfect ball and table detections of the real world. This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.

The model was fine-tuned on manually annotated data from the SurgToolLoc dataset and evaluated across three public datasets comprising over 70,000 frames.
  Results: The model achieved F1-scores between 0.993 and 1.000 for the binary detection of active cameras and correctly localized the camera tile in all cases without false multiple-camera detections.
  Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables reliable, real-time extraction of camera activation metadata from surgical videos, facilitating automated preprocessing and analysis for diverse downstream applications. All code, trained models, and annotations are publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD are limited in scope, hindering cross-context generalization and scalability evaluation in anomaly detection.

Method: ADNet aggregates 49 datasets (196,294 images) with standardized annotations. Dinomaly-m extends Dinomaly using a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts approach.

Result: State-of-the-art methods drop from 90.6% to 78.5% I-AUROC in scaling scenarios. Dinomaly-m achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC.

Conclusion: ADNet provides a scalable, standardized benchmark for anomaly detection, supporting future foundation models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify defects using normal-only training data. Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

Conclusion: End-to-end neuromorphic computing enables practical, always-on eye tracking for energy-efficient wearables.

Abstract: Eye tracking is fundamental to numerous applications, yet achieving robust, high-frequency tracking with ultra-low power consumption remains challenging for wearable platforms. While event-based vision sensors offer microsecond resolution and sparse data streams, they have lacked fully integrated, low-power processing solutions capable of real-time inference. In this work, we present the first battery-powered, wearable pupil-center-tracking system with complete on-device integration, combining event-based sensing and neuromorphic processing on the commercially available Speck2f system-on-chip with lightweight coordinate decoding on a low-power microcontroller. Our solution features a novel uncertainty-quantifying spiking neural network with gated temporal decoding, optimized for strict memory and bandwidth constraints, complemented by systematic deployment mechanisms that bridge the reality gap. We validate our system on a new multi-user dataset and demonstrate a wearable prototype with dual neuromorphic devices achieving robust binocular pupil tracking at 100 Hz with an average power consumption below 5 mW per eye. Our work demonstrates that end-to-end neuromorphic computing enables practical, always-on eye tracking for next-generation energy-efficient wearable systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models like WAN 2.2 are limited to same-view synthesis, missing opportunities for cross-view applications.

Method: Combines EgoExo-Align (latent-space alignment), MultiExoCon (multi-view conditioning), and PoseInj (pose-aware latent injection).

Result: Demonstrates high-fidelity egocentric video generation from exocentric inputs, validated on ExoEgo4D.

Conclusion: Exo2EgoSyn advances cross-view video generation without retraining, leveraging foundation models effectively.

Abstract: Foundation video generation models such as WAN 2.2 exhibit strong text- and image-conditioned synthesis abilities but remain constrained to the same-view generation setting. In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch. Experiments on ExoEgo4D validate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves Ego2Exo synthesis, paving the way for scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models. Source code and models will be released publicly.

Result: SFA achieves state-of-the-art results across public datasets, outperforming previous methods significantly.

Conclusion: SFA demonstrates effectiveness and generalizability in Video TextVQA, inspired by human question-answering processes.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) task aims to answer questions about videos by leveraging the visual text appearing within the videos. This task poses significant challenges, requiring models to accurately perceive and comprehend scene text that varies in scale, orientation, and clarity across frames, while effectively integrating temporal and semantic context to generate precise answers. Moreover, the model must identify question-relevant textual cues and filter out redundant or irrelevant information to ensure answering is guided by the most relevant and informative cues. To address these challenges, we propose SFA, a training-free framework and the first Video-LLM-based method tailored for Video TextVQA, motivated by the human process of answering questions. By adaptively scanning video frames, selectively focusing on key regions, and directly amplifying them, SFA effectively guides the Video-LLM's attention toward essential cues, enabling it to generate more accurate answers. SFA achieves new state-of-the-art results across several public Video TextVQA datasets and surpasses previous methods by a substantial margin, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LipNet, a Lipschitz-constrained network, and PromptCT, a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for SVCT reconstruction, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVCT reconstruction methods lack provable Lipschitz constraints and face high storage costs for multiple-view settings, hindering clinical use.

Method: Developed LipNet with explicit Lipschitz constraints and integrated a prompt module for discriminative knowledge. Combined these into PromptCT for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction.

Result: PromptCT outperforms benchmarks in SVCT reconstruction, offering higher-quality results with lower storage costs.

Conclusion: The proposed LipNet and PromptCT address key limitations, proving theoretical Lipschitz continuity and enabling practical clinical applications.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction algorithms, these methods still encounter two primary limitations: (i) It is challenging to explicitly prove that the prior networks of deep unfolding algorithms satisfy Lipschitz constraints due to their empirically designed nature. (ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms.

Motivation: The paper aims to improve Video QA by capturing intricate human-object interactions explicitly, moving beyond pixel-based approaches for better interpretability and reasoning.

Method: The framework represents frames as scene graphs, links human nodes across frames to a global root, and processes these graphs with GNNs. Hierarchical networks integrate graph embeddings with question features.

Result: GHR-VQA achieves a 7.3% improvement in object-relation reasoning on the AGQA dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The explicit human-centric approach enhances interpretability and performance in Video QA, validating the effectiveness of graph-based hierarchical reasoning.

Abstract: We propose GHR-VQA, Graph-guided Hierarchical Relational Reasoning for Video Question Answering (Video QA), a novel human-centric framework that incorporates scene graphs to capture intricate human-object interactions within video sequences. Unlike traditional pixel-based methods, each frame is represented as a scene graph and human nodes across frames are linked to a global root, forming the video-level graph and enabling cross-frame reasoning centered on human actors. The video-level graphs are then processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), transforming them into rich, context-aware embeddings for efficient processing. Finally, these embeddings are integrated with question features in a hierarchical network operating across different abstraction levels, enhancing both local and global understanding of video content. This explicit human-rooted structure enhances interpretability by decomposing actions into human-object interactions and enables a more profound understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. We validate our approach on the Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA) dataset, achieving significant performance improvements, including a 7.3% improvement in object-relation reasoning over the state of the art.

*Yuhang Qian,Haiyan Chen,Wentong Li,Ningzhong Liu,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CT-CIG introduces a text-guided method for generating realistic camouflage images by leveraging VLM and refining texture features, outperforming existing approaches in semantic alignment and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflage image generation methods lack logical consistency between objects and backgrounds, leading to unnatural results.

Method: CT-CIG uses a VLM-based dialogue mechanism (CRDM) to annotate datasets, finetunes Stable Diffusion with a controller for object placement, and employs FIRM for texture refinement.

Result: CLIPScore evaluations confirm semantic alignment, and camouflage effectiveness tests show photorealistic outputs.

Conclusion: CT-CIG advances CIG by integrating logical plausibility and high-frequency texture features, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Camouflage Images Generation (CIG) is an emerging research area that focuses on synthesizing images in which objects are harmoniously blended and exhibit high visual consistency with their surroundings. Existing methods perform CIG by either fusing objects into specific backgrounds or outpainting the surroundings via foreground object-guided diffusion. However, they often fail to obtain natural results because they overlook the logical relationship between camouflaged objects and background environments. To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness. Moreover, we design a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module (FIRM) to capture high-frequency texture features, facilitating the learning of complex camouflage patterns. Extensive experiments, including CLIPScore evaluation and camouflage effectiveness assessment, demonstrate the semantic alignment of our generated text prompts and CT-CIG's ability to produce photorealistic camouflage images.

TL;DR: BoxPromptIML is a weakly-supervised framework balancing annotation cost and localization accuracy in image manipulation localization, using coarse region annotations, knowledge distillation, and a dual-guidance feature fusion module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between annotation cost and localization accuracy in IML, as fully-supervised methods require costly pixel-level masks while weakly-supervised ones lack precision.

Method: Proposes coarse region annotations, a lightweight student model via knowledge distillation from SAM, and a dual-guidance feature fusion module inspired by human memory.

Result: Outperforms or matches fully-supervised models across datasets, offering strong generalization, low cost, and efficient deployment.

Conclusion: BoxPromptIML effectively balances cost and accuracy, advancing weakly-supervised IML with practical deployment benefits.

Abstract: Image manipulation localization (IML) faces a fundamental trade-off between minimizing annotation cost and achieving fine-grained localization accuracy. Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that BoxPromptIML outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models, while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment characteristics.

Method: Fine-tuning a pre-trained ViT encoder with a classification head on the BraTS-Path training dataset.

Result: Achieved MCC of 0.6509 and F1-score of 0.5330 on the test set, placing second in the challenge.

Conclusion: The ViT-based approach sets a baseline for histopathological analysis, with future work targeting performance improvements.

Abstract: The significant molecular and pathological heterogeneity of glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor, complicates diagnosis and patient stratification. While traditional histopathological assessment remains the standard, deep learning offers a promising path toward objective and automated analysis of whole slide images. For the BraTS-Path 2025 Challenge, we developed a method that fine-tunes a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a dedicated classification head on the official training dataset. Our model's performance on the online validation set, evaluated via the Synapse platform, yielded a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.7064 and an F1-score of 0.7676. On the final test set, the model achieved an MCC of 0.6509 and an F1-score of 0.5330, which secured our team second place in the BraTS-Pathology 2025 Challenge. Our results establish a solid baseline for ViT-based histopathological analysis, and future efforts will focus on bridging the performance gap observed on the unseen validation data.

### [122] [V-Attack: Targeting Disentangled Value Features for Controllable Adversarial Attacks on LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20223)
*Sen Nie,Jie Zhang,Jianxin Yan,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Attack introduces a novel method for precise local semantic manipulation in LVLMs by targeting value features (V) instead of patch-token representations, improving attack success rates by 36%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate specific semantics in images due to semantic entanglement in patch-token representations.

Method: V-Attack focuses on value features (V) in transformer attention blocks, using a Self-Value Enhancement module and a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module for precise semantic attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments on LVLMs (LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL, GPT-4o) show V-Attack improves attack success rates by 36% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: V-Attack demonstrates superior controllability in semantic manipulation, exposing vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have evolved from simply disrupting predictions on conventional task-specific models to the more complex goal of manipulating image semantics on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

*Jawaria Maqbool,M. Imran Cheema*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HistoSpeckle-Net is a deep learning model for reconstructing medical images from multimode fiber speckles, using distribution-aware learning and multiscale loss functions to outperform baseline models with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex datasets and are data-intensive, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Uses histogram-based mutual information loss and Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module for multiscale SSIM loss.

Result: Outperforms U-Net and Pix2Pix on OrganAMNIST, even with limited data and fiber bending.

Conclusion: HistoSpeckle-Net advances MMF imaging toward clinical use by improving fidelity and reducing data needs.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods in multimode fiber (MMF) imaging often focus on simpler datasets, limiting their applicability to complex, real-world imaging tasks. These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions. By effectively reconstructing complex anatomical features with reduced data and under fiber perturbations, HistoSpeckle-Net brings MMF imaging closer to practical deployment in real-world clinical environments.

*Matvei Shelukhan,Timur Mamedov,Karina Kvanchiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableTrack improves multi-object tracking accuracy under low-frequency detections by introducing a two-stage matching strategy and Bbox-Based Distance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on MOT17-val.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MOT approaches struggle with limited computing resources due to high-frequency detections. StableTrack aims to stabilize tracking quality in low-frequency scenarios.

Method: Proposes a two-stage matching strategy and Bbox-Based Distance for cross-frame association, integrating visual tracking into Kalman Filter and the pipeline.

Result: Achieves 11.6% HOTA improvement at 1 Hz on MOT17-val and performs comparably on standard benchmarks (MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack).

Conclusion: StableTrack effectively addresses low-frequency tracking challenges while maintaining performance in standard scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, where it is important to correctly detect objects and associate these detections across frames. Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.

*Bo-Kai Ruan,Teng-Fang Hsiao,Ling Lo,Yi-Lun Wu,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the fidelity-diversity dilemma in text-to-image models under long prompts, introduces LPD-Bench for evaluation, and proposes PromptMoG to enhance diversity without losing semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long prompts in text-to-image models often lead to repetitive outputs due to suppressed diversity despite high fidelity.

Method: The study introduces LPD-Bench for evaluation and proposes PromptMoG, a training-free method using Mixture-of-Gaussians sampling to boost diversity.

Result: PromptMoG improves diversity in long-prompt generation across four state-of-the-art models without semantic loss.

Conclusion: The work addresses the fidelity-diversity trade-off in long-prompt generation, offering a practical solution through PromptMoG.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved remarkable visual outcomes through large-scale rectified flow models. However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation. Building on our analysis, we develop a theoretical framework that increases sampling entropy through prompt reformulation and propose a training-free method, PromptMoG, which samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to enhance diversity while preserving semantics. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art models, SD3.5-Large, Flux.1-Krea-Dev, CogView4, and Qwen-Image, demonstrate that PromptMoG consistently improves long-prompt generation diversity without semantic drifting.

TL;DR: Zoo3D is a training-free 3D object detection framework using 2D instance masks and open-vocabulary labeling, achieving state-of-the-art results without requiring training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of closed-set methods in recognizing diverse, unseen objects by introducing a training-free approach for open-vocabulary 3D detection.

Method: Constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D masks and labels them using an open-vocabulary module with best-view selection. Includes zero-shot (Zoo3D$_0$) and self-supervised (Zoo3D$_1$) modes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, with Zoo3D$_0$ outperforming existing self-supervised methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of training-free approaches for real-world 3D object detection, offering adaptability and high performance.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for spatial understanding. Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

*Weijia Mao,Hao Chen,Zhenheng Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adv-GRPO introduces an adversarial RL framework for image generation, using dense visual rewards from reference images and foundation models to improve quality and avoid reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods rely on scalar rewards from pre-trained models, which often fail to capture human perception and suffer from reward hacking. Adv-GRPO aims to address these limitations.

Method: The framework iteratively updates a reward model and generator using adversarial rewards supervised by reference images. It leverages vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) for rich visual rewards instead of scalar outputs.

Result: Adv-GRPO outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively, in human evaluations.

Conclusion: Adv-GRPO's use of dense visual rewards and reference images improves image generation quality, aesthetics, and avoids reward hacking, enabling flexible style customization.

Abstract: A reliable reward function is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) in image generation. Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively. Code and models have been released.

### [128] [Modality-Balanced Collaborative Distillation for Multi-Modal Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20258)
*Xiaohan Wang,Zhangtao Cheng,Ting Zhong,Leiting Chen,Fan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MBCD is a unified collaborative distillation framework addressing Weight Averaging's limitations in multi-modal domain generalization by promoting balanced modality optimization and flatter loss landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight Averaging struggles in multi-modal settings due to uneven optimization speeds, leading to biased modality contributions and less generalizable solutions.

Method: MBCD uses adaptive modality dropout, gradient consistency constraints, and WA-based cross-modal distillation to ensure balanced modality learning and flatter minima.

Result: MBCD outperforms existing methods on MMDG benchmarks, achieving better accuracy and robustness across unseen domains.

Conclusion: MBCD effectively addresses WA's multi-modal limitations, enhancing generalization through balanced modality fusion and flatter loss landscapes.

Abstract: Weight Averaging (WA) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing generalization by promoting convergence to a flat loss landscape, which correlates with stronger out-of-distribution performance. However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions. Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show that MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiDiCM, a diffusion-based framework for image classification that outperforms conventional methods, especially under challenging conditions like corrupted inputs or limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image classification methods perform poorly under high-uncertainty conditions, such as corrupted images or limited training data, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: DiDiCM uses a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on input images, allowing flexible predictions on class probabilities or discrete labels.

Result: DiDiCM achieves higher classification accuracy on ImageNet compared to standard classifiers, with greater gains as task difficulty increases.

Conclusion: DiDiCM offers a flexible and effective alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in challenging scenarios, and its code is publicly available.

Abstract: Image classification is a well-studied task in computer vision, and yet it remains challenging under high-uncertainty conditions, such as when input images are corrupted or training data are limited. Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging. We release our code at https://github.com/omerb01/didicm .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of detecting subtle defects in industrial settings where defective samples are scarce.

Method: Integrates a neural batch sampler, autoencoder, and predictor using RL for adaptive patch selection and anomaly segmentation.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy and better localization of subtle anomalies on MVTec AD dataset, with average improvements of 0.15 in F1_max and 0.06 in AUC.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in industrial visual inspection is challenging due to the scarcity of defective samples. Most existing methods rely on unsupervised reconstruction using only normal data, often resulting in overfitting and poor detection of subtle defects. We propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor. The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space. This interaction enables the system to effectively learn both normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and better localization of subtle anomalies than recent state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining low complexity, yielding an average improvement of 0.15 in F1_max and 0.06 in AUC, with a maximum gain of 0.37 in F1_max in the best case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of intuitive, human-like understanding of physical and social principles in MLLMs, termed visual knowledge, which bridges perception and reasoning.

Method: Introduces VKnowU benchmark with 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 visual knowledge types. Proposes VideoKnow+, a model using a See-Think-Answer paradigm and reinforcement learning with visual knowledge rewards.

Result: Evaluation of 23 MLLMs shows gaps in world-centric understanding. VideoKnow+ improves performance by 3.7% on VKnowU and shows gains on other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual knowledge is crucial for generalizable MLLMs. VideoKnow+ demonstrates potential by integrating visual knowledge, enhancing understanding of physical and social worlds.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become adept at recognizing objects, they often lack the intuitive, human-like understanding of the world's underlying physical and social principles. This high-level vision-grounded semantics, which we term visual knowledge, forms a bridge between perception and reasoning, yet remains an underexplored area in current MLLMs. To systematically evaluate this capability, we present VKnowU, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 core types of visual knowledge spanning both world-centric (e.g., intuitive physics) and human-centric (e.g., subjective intentions). Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs. VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU. Our work highlights visual knowledge as a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can not only see but also truly understand our physical and social worlds.

TL;DR: ScenarioCLIP addresses the lack of explicit relational and compositional modeling in CLIP-based models by incorporating text, grounded relations, and focused regions for scene analysis, outperforming baselines in zero-shot and fine-tuned tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenes involve multiple objects and actions, but current CLIP-based methods focus on single-object tasks or predefined class lists, ignoring relational structure.

Method: ScenarioCLIP uses input texts, grounded relations, images, and focused regions, pretrained on curated scenario data and fine-tuned for tasks like cross-modal retrieval. A novel dataset was generated to address domain-specific data scarcity.

Result: ScenarioCLIP shows strong performance in zero-shot and fine-tuned tasks for scenario-based applications.

Conclusion: ScenarioCLIP advances CLIP-based models by explicitly modeling relational and compositional structures, providing a robust solution for complex scene understanding.

Abstract: Until recently, the general corpus of CLIP-type fundamental models has widely explored either the retrieval of short descriptions or the classification of objects in the scene as SINGLE-object image classification task. The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/scenario-clip/ScenarioCLIP

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses poor detection performance and conflicts between detection and association in transformer-based tracking models. It builds on the insight that MOTR-like models have hidden detection capabilities.

Method: SelfMOTR integrates self-generated detection priors, leveraging the hidden detection strengths of MOTR-like models. It employs extensive analysis and ablation studies to optimize these priors.

Result: SelfMOTR achieves strong performance on DanceTrack, competing with recent state-of-the-art end-to-end tracking methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that self-generated detection priors can effectively enhance tracking performance in transformer architectures, validating the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models.

Abstract: Despite progress toward end-to-end tracking with transformer architectures, poor detection performance and the conflict between detection and association in a joint architecture remain critical concerns. Recent approaches aim to mitigate these issues by (i) employing advanced denoising or label assignment strategies, or (ii) incorporating detection priors from external object detectors via distillation or anchor proposal techniques. Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively. On DanceTrack, SelfMOTR achieves strong performance, competing with recent state-of-the-art end-to-end tracking methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in video generation has led to impressive visual quality, yet current models still struggle to produce results that align with real-world physical principles. To this end, we propose an iterative self-refinement framework that leverages large language models and vision-language models to provide physics-aware guidance for video generation. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal chain-of-thought (MM-CoT) process that refines prompts based on feedback from physical inconsistencies, progressively enhancing generation quality. This method is training-free and plug-and-play, making it readily applicable to a wide range of video generation models. Experiments on the PhyIQ benchmark show that our method improves the Physics-IQ score from 56.31 to 62.38. We hope this work serves as a preliminary exploration of physics-consistent video generation and may offer insights for future research.

TL;DR: CrossEarth-Gate introduces a comprehensive RS module toolbox and a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism to address domain gaps in RS data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods fail to handle multifaceted domain gaps in large-scale Earth observation tasks, necessitating a more adaptable solution.

Method: Proposes CrossEarth-Gate with a RS module toolbox (spatial, semantic, frequency modules) and a Fisher-guided mechanism to dynamically activate critical modules.

Result: Achieves top performance across 16 cross-domain benchmarks for RS semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: CrossEarth-Gate effectively addresses domain gaps and enhances adaptation efficiency in RS tasks.

Abstract: In Remote Sensing (RS), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key approach to activate the generalizable representation ability of foundation models for downstream tasks. However, existing specialized PEFT methods often fail when applied to large-scale Earth observation tasks, as they are unable to fully handle the multifaceted and unpredictable domain gaps (\eg, spatial, semantic, and frequency shifts) inherent in RS data. To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow. It dynamically activates only the most critical modules at the appropriate layers, guiding the gradient flow to maximize adaptation effectiveness and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy and generalizability of our method, where CrossEarth-Gate achieves state-of-the-art performance across 16 cross-domain benchmarks for RS semantic segmentation. The code of the work will be released.

*Han Guo,Chenyang Liu,Haotian Zhang,Bowen Chen,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaCo introduces a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint to enhance remote sensing change detection by leveraging textual semantics and visual features, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on mask supervision, which lacks constraints on temporal semantic transitions, leading to semantic inconsistencies despite coherent spatial predictions.

Method: TaCo uses a Text-guided Transition Generator to integrate textual semantics with visual features and applies a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint for alignment and discrimination.

Result: TaCo achieves superior performance on six public datasets for binary and semantic change detection tasks.

Conclusion: TaCo effectively addresses semantic inconsistencies in remote sensing change detection by incorporating spatio-temporal constraints, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes across bi-temporal satellite images. Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes. This design can yield substantial performance gains without introducing any additional computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, spanning both binary and semantic change detection tasks, demonstrate that TaCo consistently achieves SOTA performance.

*Shengqian Li,Ming Gao,Yi Liu,Zuzeng Lin,Feng Wang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TReFT improves Rectified Flow models for faster, one-step image translation by leveraging pretrained velocity predictions and addressing convergence issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RF models for image translation rely on costly multi-step denoising, limiting real-time use. TReFT aims to enable one-step translation by solving convergence issues.

Method: TReFT uses pretrained DiT or UNet velocity predictions as output, introduces latent cycle-consistency and identity losses, and simplifies architectures for efficiency.

Result: TReFT achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets while enabling real-time inference.

Conclusion: TReFT successfully adapts pretrained RF models for efficient one-step image translation, overcoming prior limitations.

Abstract: Rectified Flow (RF) models have advanced high-quality image and video synthesis via optimal transport theory. However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.

### [138] [IrisNet: Infrared Image Status Awareness Meta Decoder for Infrared Small Targets Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20319)
*Xuelin Qian,Jiaming Lu,Zixuan Wang,Wenxuan Wang,Zhongling Huang,Dingwen Zhang,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IrisNet dynamically adapts detection strategies for Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) using meta-learning and a transformer-based approach, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static deep learning models struggle with diverse IRSTD scenarios due to pattern drift. IrisNet aims to improve robustness by dynamically adapting to input variations.

Method: IrisNet uses an image-to-decoder transformer to dynamically map infrared features to decoder parameters, integrates high-frequency components for better perception, and models inter-layer dependencies.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets.

Conclusion: IrisNet effectively addresses the limitations of static models in IRSTD by leveraging dynamic adaptation and transformer-based techniques.

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratios, complex backgrounds, and the absence of discernible target features. While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information. Experiments on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of our IrisNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Tianyi Yan,Tao Tang,Xingtai Gui,Yongkang Li,Jiasen Zhesng,Weiyao Huang,Lingdong Kong,Wencheng Han,Xia Zhou,Xueyang Zhang,Yifei Zhan,Kun Zhan,Cheng-zhong Xu,Jianbing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using an Impartial World Model to improve RL-based autonomous driving by addressing optimistic bias in world models, enhancing safety predictions through a novel data synthesis pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for autonomous driving suffer from optimistic biases in world models, leading to poor handling of safety-critical and long-tail events.

Method: Introduces an Impartial World Model trained via Counterfactual Synthesis, a data pipeline generating plausible collisions and off-road events, and integrates it as a critic in RL refinement.

Result: The model outperforms baselines in predicting failures and reduces safety violations in simulations, validated on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark.

Conclusion: Teaching models to anticipate dangers through honest forecasting is crucial for developing safer autonomous agents.

Abstract: End-to-end models for autonomous driving hold the promise of learning complex behaviors directly from sensor data, but face critical challenges in safety and handling long-tail events. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for estimating homography from single shelf images using ConvNeXt and normalized coordinate regression, achieving competitive accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homography estimation from a single image is valuable for retail shelf monitoring but challenging due to limited viewpoints.

Method: Uses ConvNeXt backbone and normalized coordinate regression, with synthetic homography augmentation for data scarcity.

Result: Achieves mean corner error of 1.298 pixels, outperforming classical and deep learning methods.

Conclusion: Proposed method is robust and efficient for real-world single-view rectification; dataset and code will be shared.

Abstract: Estimating homography from a single image remains a challenging yet practically valuable task, particularly in domains like retail, where only one viewpoint is typically available for shelf monitoring and product alignment. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework that predicts a 4-point parameterized homography matrix to rectify shelf images captured from arbitrary angles. Our model leverages a ConvNeXt-based backbone for enhanced feature representation and adopts normalized coordinate regression for improved stability. To address data scarcity and promote generalization, we introduce a novel augmentation strategy by modeling and sampling synthetic homographies. Our method achieves a mean corner error of 1.298 pixels on the test set. When compared with both classical computer vision and deep learning-based approaches, our method demonstrates competitive performance in both accuracy and inference speed. Together, these results establish our approach as a robust and efficient solution for realworld single-view rectification. To encourage further research in this domain, we will make our dataset, ShelfRectSet, and code publicly available

Result: AMB3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose, depth, metric-scale estimation, and 3D reconstruction, outperforming optimization-based SLAM and SfM methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMB3R demonstrates versatility and superior performance across multiple 3D vision tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution without task-specific adaptations.

Abstract: We present AMB3R, a multi-view feed-forward model for dense 3D reconstruction on a metric-scale that addresses diverse 3D vision tasks. The key idea is to leverage a sparse, yet compact, volumetric scene representation as our backend, enabling geometric reasoning with spatial compactness. Although trained solely for multi-view reconstruction, we demonstrate that AMB3R can be seamlessly extended to uncalibrated visual odometry (online) or large-scale structure from motion without the need for task-specific fine-tuning or test-time optimization. Compared to prior pointmap-based models, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose, depth, and metric-scale estimation, 3D reconstruction, and even surpasses optimization-based SLAM and SfM methods with dense reconstruction priors on common benchmarks.

*João Malheiro Silva,Andy Huynh,Tong Duy Son,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A camera-only pipeline for 3D reconstruction in Digital Twins uses 3D Gaussian Splatting and semantic material masks, eliminating LiDAR-camera fusion complexities while maintaining fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion lacks semantics and struggles with materials like glass, requiring complex calibration.

Method: Uses multi-view images for 3D Gaussian Splatting, extracts semantic masks with vision models, converts to meshes with material labels, and assigns physics-based properties.

Result: Achieves photorealistic reconstruction and physics-based material assignment without hardware complexity, validated against LiDAR ground truth.

Conclusion: The camera-only approach matches LiDAR-camera fusion fidelity while simplifying hardware and calibration.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics.

### [143] [Thinking in 360°: Humanoid Visual Search in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20351)
*Heyang Yu,Yinan Han,Xiangyu Zhang,Baiqiao Yin,Bowen Chang,Xiangyu Han,Xinhao Liu,Jing Zhang,Marco Pavone,Chen Feng,Saining Xie,Yiming Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces humanoid visual search using a 360° panoramic image and H* Bench, a benchmark for challenging real-world scenarios, showing proprietary models struggle (~30% success), while enhancing Qwen2.5-VL improves performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans, bypassing real-world hardware constraints and addressing limitations of prior static-image approaches.

Method: Proposes humanoid visual search with active head rotation in 360° panoramic images, using H* Bench for testing in visually-crowded scenarios.

Result: Even top models struggle (~30% success); post-training Qwen2.5-VL boosts object search from 14.83% to 47.38% and path search from 6.44% to 24.94%.

Conclusion: Humanoid visual search shows promise but highlights the challenge of integrating MLLM agents into everyday life, especially for complex spatial tasks.

Abstract: Humans rely on the synergistic control of head (cephalomotor) and eye (oculomotor) to efficiently search for visual information in 360°. However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360° panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense. Our results not only show a promising path forward but also quantify the immense challenge that remains in building MLLM agents that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday human life.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-Checker is a novel method for localizing tampered regions in 3DGS models without needing expensive 3D labels, using tampering attributes and a 3D contrastive mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about malicious manipulation of 3D content, the paper aims to provide a solution for detecting and localizing tampered areas in 3DGS models.

Method: The approach integrates a 3D tampering attribute into Gaussian parameters and uses a 3D contrastive mechanism to compare similarity between Gaussians. A cyclic optimization strategy refines the tampering attribute.

Result: Extensive experiments show GS-Checker effectively locates tampered areas in 3DGS models.

Conclusion: GS-Checker offers a practical and accurate solution for tampering localization in 3DGS models without requiring costly supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in editing technologies for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made it simple to manipulate 3D scenes. However, these technologies raise concerns about potential malicious manipulation of 3D content. To avoid such malicious applications, localizing tampered regions becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose GS-Checker, a novel method for locating tampered areas in 3DGS models. Our approach integrates a 3D tampering attribute into the 3D Gaussian parameters to indicate whether the Gaussian has been tampered. Additionally, we design a 3D contrastive mechanism by comparing the similarity of key attributes between 3D Gaussians to seek tampering cues at 3D level. Furthermore, we introduce a cyclic optimization strategy to refine the 3D tampering attribute, enabling more accurate tampering localization. Notably, our approach does not require expensive 3D labels for supervision. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to locate the tampered 3DGS area.

TL;DR: VGGTFace introduces an automatic method using VGGT for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from multi-view images, addressing limitations of manual efforts and 3DMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for facial geometry reconstruction are manual, lack generalization, or are limited by 3DMMs. VGGTFace aims to automate this with better generalization and expressiveness.

Method: Leverages VGGT for point map representation, augments it with Pixel3DMM for topology, and uses Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment to fuse point clouds with Laplacian energy.

Result: Achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on an RTX 4090, with state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and in-the-wild data.

Conclusion: VGGTFace effectively automates facial reconstruction with strong generalization and expressiveness, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing topologically consistent facial geometry is crucial for the digital avatar creation pipelines. Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and impressive generalization to in-the-wild data. Code is available at https://github.com/grignarder/vggtface.

*Xinwan Wen,Bowen Li,Jiajun Luo,Ye Li,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FREE is a novel framework accelerating DiTs by leveraging feature-level autoregression and uncertainty-guided relaxation, achieving up to 2.25x speedup without compromising generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs suffer from high inference latency due to long denoising trajectories, and existing speculative inference methods lack accuracy for efficient DiT acceleration.

Method: FREE uses a lightweight drafter for feature-level autoregression with parallel verification and introduces uncertainty-guided relaxation to adjust acceptance probabilities.

Result: On ImageNet-$512^2$, FREE achieves up to 1.86x speedup, and FREE (relax) reaches 2.25x acceleration while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: FREE significantly reduces DiTs' inference latency while preserving perceptual and quantitative fidelity, addressing the limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art generation quality but require long sequential denoising trajectories, leading to high inference latency. Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.

*Jiawei Lin,Guanlong Jiao,Jianjin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiID is a training-free method for multi-ID customization in images, addressing copy-paste issues and text controllability challenges using ID-decoupled cross-attention and enhanced generation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-ID customization is challenging due to copy-paste issues and poor text controllability, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: MultiID introduces an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism and three strategies (local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, extended self-attention) to improve results.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on IDBench show MultiID effectively tackles the challenges and outperforms training-based methods.

Conclusion: MultiID offers a robust, training-free solution for multi-ID customization, achieving high-quality, text-aligned outputs.

Abstract: Multi-ID customization is an interesting topic in computer vision and attracts considerable attention recently. Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continuous-time consistency distillation methods rely heavily on training data and resources, limiting scalability and deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Proposes Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), extracting latent representations from the teacher model's trajectory instead of external data, improving efficiency and simplicity.

Result: Achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k with one-step generation, reduces training time by ~40%, and saves GPU memory.

Conclusion: TBCM offers superior efficiency without quality loss, addresses the diffusion-generation space discrepancy, and provides insights for future distillation research.

Abstract: Timestep distillation is an effective approach for improving the generation efficiency of diffusion models. The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

Motivation: Existing methods fail to balance text-based creative flexibility with structural editability in 3D city generation, motivating MajutsuCity's development.

Method: MajutsuCity uses a four-stage pipeline and represents cities as controllable layouts, assets, and materials. It integrates MajutsuAgent for interactive editing and MajutsuDataset for multimodal assets.

Result: MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% vs CityDreamer and 20.1% vs CityCraft, ranking first in AQS and RDR scores, showcasing superior geometric fidelity and controllability.

Conclusion: MajutsuCity sets a new state-of-the-art in 3D city generation, inspiring future research. The dataset and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D cities is fundamental to world models, virtual reality, and game development, where an ideal urban scene must satisfy both stylistic diversity, fine-grained, and controllability. However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/MajutsuCity.

*Manil Shrestha,Edward Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid algorithms improve efficiency and verifiability in multi-hop QA over knowledge graphs by combining LLM-guided planning and embedding-guided neural search, reducing reliance on massive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the combinatorial explosion of reasoning paths and the inefficiency/unverifiability of LLM-based approaches in multi-hop QA.

Method: Two algorithms: (1) LLM-Guided Planning (single LLM call for relation sequences) and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search (no LLM calls, lightweight edge scorer).

Result: Achieves near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) and 100x speedup. Grounded reasoning outperforms ungrounded generation.

Conclusion: Verifiable multi-hop reasoning can be efficient without massive models by combining symbolic structure and learned representations.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering over knowledge graphs remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible reasoning paths. Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.

### [151] [Can LLMs Faithfully Explain Themselves in Low-Resource Languages? A Case Study on Emotion Detection in Persian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19719)
*Mobina Mehrazar,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Parisa Abolfath Beygi,Behnam Bahrak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates how faithful LLM-generated explanations are in Persian emotion classification, comparing them to human judgments. It tests two prompting strategies and finds LLMs often diverge from faithful reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations, especially in low-resource languages like Persian, prompted this evaluation.

Method: The study compares LLM-generated explanations (using two prompting strategies) to human annotations, assessing faithfulness via token-level log-probability confidence scores.

Result: LLMs perform well in classification but their explanations often deviate from faithful reasoning, aligning more with each other than human judgments.

Conclusion: Current LLM explanation methods lack faithfulness in multilingual/low-resource contexts, calling for more robust approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate self-explanations alongside their predictions, a practice that raises concerns about the faithfulness of these explanations, especially in low-resource languages. This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments. These results highlight the limitations of current explanation methods and metrics, emphasizing the need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Encoder-only models like BioLinkBERT outperform larger decoder-based models in cardiology text embeddings, offering better performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic comparisons of transformer-based models in clinical NLP, specifically for cardiology.

Method: Evaluated ten LoRA fine-tuned transformer models on 106,535 cardiology text pairs from medical textbooks.

Result: BioLinkBERT (encoder-only) achieved superior performance (separation score: 0.510) with lower computational demands.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that larger models aren't always better for domain-specific embeddings and provides resources for reproducible research.

Abstract: Domain-specific text embeddings are critical for clinical natural language processing, yet systematic comparisons across model architectures remain limited. This study evaluates ten transformer-based embedding models adapted for cardiology through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on 106,535 cardiology text pairs derived from authoritative medical textbooks. Results demonstrate that encoder-only architectures, particularly BioLinkBERT, achieve superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) compared to larger decoder-based models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. The findings challenge the assumption that larger language models necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings and provide practical guidance for clinical NLP system development. All models, training code, and evaluation datasets are publicly available to support reproducible research in medical informatics.

*Colton Casto,Anna Ivanova,Evelina Fedorenko,Nancy Kanwisher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that deep language understanding involves exporting information from the brain's core language system to other regions for richer mental models, supported by cognitive neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain how deep language understanding requires integrating linguistic input with perceptual, motor, and memory systems.

Method: Reviewing existing evidence and proposing a hypothesis based on cognitive neuroscience advances.

Result: Cognitive neuroscience supports the idea that understanding language involves broader neural integration.

Conclusion: Recent progress in cognitive neuroscience offers tools to test how language understanding works cognitively and neurally.

Abstract: Language understanding entails not just extracting the surface-level meaning of the linguistic input, but constructing rich mental models of the situation it describes. Here we propose that because processing within the brain's core language system is fundamentally limited, deeply understanding language requires exporting information from the language system to other brain regions that compute perceptual and motor representations, construct mental models, and store our world knowledge and autobiographical memories. We review the existing evidence for this hypothesis, and argue that recent progress in cognitive neuroscience provides both the conceptual foundation and the methods to directly test it, thus opening up a new strategy to reveal what it means, cognitively and neurally, to understand language.

TL;DR: The paper examines gender biases in LLMs' emotional theory of mind and evaluates debiasing strategies, favoring training interventions over prompt-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and ensure fairness in LLMs, particularly in their responses to emotional theory of mind queries, addressing potential gender biases.

Method: Investigates biases in LLMs by asking 'How does this person feel?' based on descriptions. Tests debiasing strategies, comparing training interventions with prompt-based approaches.

Result: Shows that training-based interventions are more effective than prompt engineering for reducing bias in LLMs.

Conclusion: Meaningful bias reduction in LLMs requires training interventions, not just prompt-based methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their growing integration into daily life underscore the importance of evaluating and ensuring their fairness. In this work, we examine fairness within the domain of emotional theory of mind, investigating whether LLMs exhibit gender biases when presented with a description of a person and their environment and asked, "How does this person feel?". Furthermore, we propose and evaluate several debiasing strategies, demonstrating that achieving meaningful reductions in bias requires training based interventions rather than relying solely on inference-time prompt-based approaches such as prompt engineering.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NRC VAD Lexicon v2, expanding the original lexicon with 10k MWEs and 25k words, showcasing high reliability and enabling diverse research applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the existing NRC VAD Lexicon by adding Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and updating word coverage for broader research utility.

Method: Human ratings for Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D) were collected for MWEs and their constituent words, alongside updating unigrams.

Result: The lexicon now includes 10k MWEs and 25k words, demonstrating high reliability and enabling analyses of MWEs' emotional characteristics.

Conclusion: NRC VAD Lexicon v2 is a reliable resource for studying emotional attributes in MWEs and words, applicable across multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences.

*Koena Ronny Mabokela,Tim Schlippe,Mpho Raborife,Turgay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automatic, language-independent sentiment labeling method using sentiment-bearing emojis and words, tested on English, Sepedi, and Setswana tweets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis is crucial but challenging for low-resource African languages due to lack of labeled data. Manual labeling is costly and time-consuming.

Method: Leverages sentiment-bearing emojis and words for automatic labeling, reducing manual effort.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 66% (English), 69% (Sepedi), and 63% (Setswana), with 34% of labels needing correction.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces manual labeling effort for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a helpful task to automatically analyse opinions and emotions on various topics in areas such as AI for Social Good, AI in Education or marketing. While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.

*Shi-Wei Dai,Yan-Wei Shie,Tsung-Huan Yang,Lun-Wei Ku,Yung-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaPulse optimizes prompts to enhance personality expression in LLMs, outperforming prior methods and exploring model size and trait control effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personality expression in LLMs by optimizing prompts, addressing gaps in prior work.

Method: Uses iterative prompt enhancement and situational benchmarks for realistic evaluation.

Result: Generated prompts outperform previous methods; model size and optimization pauses affect trait evocation.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization is key for realistic personality expression in LLMs, guiding future adaptive AI research.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be an effective way to create more engaging and enjoyable user-AI interactions. While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process. These findings underscore the importance of prompt optimization in shaping personality expression within LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research on adaptive AI interactions.

*Farzad Ahmed,Joniel Augustine Jerome,Meliha Yetisgen,Özlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates zero-shot, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for detecting and correcting medical errors in clinical documentation. RDP outperforms the other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical documentation errors can harm patient safety, and LLMs may help detect and correct these errors. The study aims to understand how LLMs perform under different prompting strategies.

Method: Using the MEDEC dataset, nine instruction-tuned LLMs are evaluated with zero-shot, SPR, and RDP strategies for three subtasks: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction. Performance metrics include accuracy, recall, FPR, and composite scores.

Result: Zero-shot performed poorly in recall, SPR improved recall but raised FPR, and RDP reduced FPR by 15%, boosted recall by 5-10%, and improved correction accuracy.

Conclusion: RDP is superior to zero-shot and SPR prompting, enhancing detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and improving medical error correction reliability.

Abstract: Objective: Clinical documentation contains factual, diagnostic, and management errors that can compromise patient safety. Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.
  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.
  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.
  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.

TL;DR: AppSelectBench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating application selection in Computer Using Agents (CUAs), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on inter-application reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack insight into models' ability to reason across and choose between different applications, limiting CUAs' effectiveness in task execution.

Method: AppSelectBench includes a user task generation pipeline for diverse user intents and unified evaluation protocols (random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, retrieval-augmented). It covers 100 desktop applications and over 100K tasks.

Result: Experiments show systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, revealing that even top models struggle with consistent application choices.

Conclusion: AppSelectBench provides a foundation for advancing application-level reasoning in CUAs, an essential yet underexplored capability.

Abstract: Computer Using Agents (CUAs) are increasingly equipped with external tools, enabling them to perform complex and realistic tasks. For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

TL;DR: R2R is a domain-aware framework combining dynamic expert routing and a two-stage training strategy to improve reranking in specialized fields like finance and law, outperforming generalist and fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist models lack domain-specific insights in critical fields, and naive fine-tuning leads to overfitting and knowledge loss.

Method: R2R uses Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG) with a counter-shortcut mechanism and a Latent Semantic Router for optimal expert selection.

Result: R2R outperforms baselines across diverse domains (legal, medical, financial) and demonstrates cross-domain robustness.

Conclusion: R2R offers a modular, model-agnostic solution for domain specialization with strong performance.

Abstract: Decoder-only rerankers are central to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines. Our results confirm that R2R is a model-agnostic and modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness.

### [161] [Directional Optimization Asymmetry in Transformers: A Synthetic Stress Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19997)
*Mihir Sahasrabudhe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why Transformers struggle with directional learning, using synthetic data to show directional optimization gaps persist even without linguistic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if directional failures in Transformers stem from architecture or linguistic statistics.

Method: A synthetic benchmark with tunable entropy tests directional learning in scratch-trained and pre-trained GPT-2 models.

Result: Transformers show significant directional gaps, unaffected by pre-training or LoRA, indicating intrinsic architectural bias.

Conclusion: The study reveals directional friction in Transformers is architecture-driven, motivating further mechanistic research.

Abstract: Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a "reversal curse," and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.

TL;DR: A unified multiclass framework detects mental health and cyberbullying issues from social media, with MentalBERT outperforming others. Ethical considerations and a practical dashboard are introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing rising mental health and cyberbullying challenges in digital spaces requires scalable, interpretable detection systems.

Method: Uses a "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data and evaluate on imbalanced sets. Compares lexical models, hybrids, and fine-tuned transformers like MentalBERT.

Result: MentalBERT achieves 0.92 accuracy and 0.76 Macro F1, outperforming generic models and zero-shot LLMs. A prototype dashboard aids moderators.

Conclusion: The framework is a scalable screening tool, not diagnostic, with future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets.

Abstract: Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online-PVLM, a framework for real-time online concept learning in personalized visual language models using hyperbolic representations, eliminating the need for separate embeddings for each concept. It also presents OP-Eval, a benchmark for evaluating this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for personalized VLMs require separate embeddings for each concept, lacking real-time adaptation and scalability. This gap motivates the proposed Online-PVLM framework.

Method: The authors leverage hyperbolic representations to enable a train-free paradigm for generating concept embeddings during testing, enhancing scalability and efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance, validated by the OP-Eval benchmark comprising 1,292 concepts and over 30K instances.

Conclusion: Online-PVLM offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-time concept learning in personalized VLMs, demonstrated by superior performance on a large-scale benchmark.

Abstract: Personalized Visual Language Models (VLMs) are gaining increasing attention for their formidable ability in user-specific concepts aligned interactions (e.g., identifying a user's bike). Existing methods typically require the learning of separate embeddings for each new concept, which fails to support real-time adaptation during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in large-scale scenarios, where efficient retrieval of concept embeddings is not achievable. To alleviate this gap, we propose Online-PVLM, a framework for online concept learning by leveraging hyperbolic representations. Our approach makes a train-free paradigm for concept embeddings generation at test time, making the use of personalized VLMs both scalable and efficient. In addition, we develop OP-Eval, a comprehensive and large-scale benchmark comprising 1,292 concepts and over 30K high-quality instances with diverse question types, designed to rigorously assess online concept learning in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed framework. Our source code and dataset will be made available.

TL;DR: MTA is a Merge-then-Adapt framework addressing scalability and sparse-data challenges in Personalized Large Language Models by merging meta-LoRAs dynamically and stacking lightweight LoRAs for few-shot personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for personalizing LLMs face scalability issues due to linear storage costs and suboptimal performance for users with sparse data.

Method: MTA involves: (1) creating a shared Meta-LoRA Bank, (2) dynamically merging relevant meta-LoRAs for flexible personalization, and (3) stacking lightweight LoRAs for few-shot tuning.

Result: MTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the LaMP benchmark across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: MTA provides a scalable, flexible, and effective solution for personalized LLMs, especially for users with limited data.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasPrompting improves LLMs' MCQ performance by generating and evaluating reasoning for all answer options before final prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCQ methods lack contextual grounding for answer choices, limiting reasoning capabilities.

Method: BiasPrompting involves reasoning generation for each option and synthesizing these reasonings to select the best answer.

Result: Significant improvements in five MCQ benchmarks, enhancing LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: BiasPrompting boosts LLM performance in complex questions, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their performance on multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks has improved significantly. However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks. Our experiments showcase that BiasPrompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex and challenging questions, particularly in settings where existing methods underperform.

*Zhenyi Shen,Junru Lu,Lin Gui,Jiazheng Li,Yulan He,Di Yin,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention) is a unified training framework addressing the paradox of low sparsity in native sparse-attention methods by ensuring bidirectional alignment and gradient flow, leading to improved performance and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full attention in LLMs has quadratic complexity, limiting long-context processing. Sparse attention reduces costs but often degrades performance due to gradient update deficiencies.

Method: SSA integrates sparse and full attention, enforcing bidirectional alignment and preserving gradient flow to all tokens, promoting stronger sparsity while aligning with full-attention outputs.

Result: SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on sparse and full attention tasks, adapts to varying sparsity budgets, and improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating over-allocation.

Conclusion: SSA effectively balances sparsity and performance, offering flexible compute-performance trade-offs and enhanced extrapolation capabilities.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of monolingual and single-label emotion corpora by capturing linguistic diversity and mixed emotions.

Method: Collects expressive utterances with intra-utterance code-switching, annotated for 32 emotion categories, and tests using self-supervised learning models.

Result: HuBERT-large-EN performed best in speaker-independent evaluations.

Conclusion: EM2LDL supports advanced affective computing applications like mental health monitoring and cross-cultural communication.

Abstract: This study introduces EM2LDL, a novel multilingual speech corpus designed to advance mixed emotion recognition through label distribution learning. Addressing the limitations of predominantly monolingual and single-label emotion corpora \textcolor{black}{that restrict linguistic diversity, are unable to model mixed emotions, and lack ecological validity}, EM2LDL comprises expressive utterances in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, capturing the intra-utterance code-switching prevalent in multilingual regions like Hong Kong and Macao. The corpus integrates spontaneous emotional expressions from online platforms, annotated with fine-grained emotion distributions across 32 categories. Experimental baselines using self-supervised learning models demonstrate robust performance in speaker-independent gender-, age-, and personality-based evaluations, with HuBERT-large-EN achieving optimal results. By incorporating linguistic diversity and ecological validity, EM2LDL enables the exploration of complex emotional dynamics in multilingual settings. This work provides a versatile testbed for developing adaptive, empathetic systems for applications in affective computing, including mental health monitoring and cross-cultural communication. The dataset, annotations, and baseline codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xingfengli/EM2LDL.

*Somsubhra De,Harsh Kumar,Arun Prakash A*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores prompting-based approaches using advanced LLMs like GPT-4.1 for Grammatical Error Correction in Indic languages, achieving top results with minimal adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is underdeveloped for Indic languages due to limited resources and linguistic complexity. This work aims to leverage large language models (LLMs) to address this gap.

Method: The study employs prompting strategies (zero-shot and few-shot) with LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5, LLaMA-4) to adapt them for Indic languages, without extensive fine-tuning.

Result: The approach outperformed fine-tuned models like Sarvam-22B, achieving top ranks in tasks for Tamil (GLEU: 91.57), Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97).

Conclusion: Prompt-driven techniques with LLMs effectively bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC, demonstrating their superior generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical mistakes in text. While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97). These findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt-driven NLP techniques and underscore the potential of large-scale LLMs to bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing grid-tagging models with image data augmentation techniques to improve discontinuous NER, showing significant F1 score improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing segmentation and omission issues in recognizing discontinuous entities in NER tasks, as traditional methods struggle with these challenges.

Method: Integrates image data augmentation techniques (cropping, scaling, padding) into grid-based models to improve discontinuous entity recognition.

Result: Achieves F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities on CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets.

Conclusion: The augmented grid models effectively improve recognition of discontinuous entities, outperforming traditional segmentation methods.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in natural language processing, yet it remains particularly challenging for discontinuous entities. The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Chuyi Kong,Gao Wei,Jing Ma,Hongzhan Lin,Zhiyuan Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REFLEX is a novel paradigm for automated fact-checking that improves accuracy and explanation quality by leveraging internal model knowledge and adaptive activation pairs, outperforming traditional methods with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation on social media erodes public trust, necessitating fast, reliable, and interpretable fact-checking systems. Existing LLM-based approaches suffer from latency and hallucinations due to reliance on external knowledge.

Method: REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as role-play dialogue, jointly training verdict prediction and explanation generation. It uses contrastive activation pairs to disentangle truth into style and substance, guiding inference for faithful reasoning.

Result: REFLEX achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 465 self-refined samples and improves accuracy by up to 7.57% by leveraging internal explanation signals.

Conclusion: REFLEX demonstrates that internal model signals can enhance both interpretation and reasoning in fact-checking, offering a scalable and efficient solution compared to external-knowledge-dependent methods.

Abstract: The prevalence of misinformation on social media threatens public trust, demanding automated fact-checking systems that provide accurate verdicts with interpretable explanations. However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.

*Luohe Shi,Zuchao Li,Lefei Zhang,Baoyuan Qi,Guoming Liu,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecFormer accelerates LLM inference by blending unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms, reducing reliance on large draft trees and achieving consistent speedup even in large-batch scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding methods assume high computing power and use complex draft trees, but batching outperforms them by compressing idle resources. Low-resource speculative decoding is needed.

Method: Proposes SpecFormer, integrating unidirectional and bidirectional attention to combine autoregressive and non-autoregressive benefits, eliminating large draft trees.

Result: Demonstrates consistent acceleration in large-batch scenarios with lower training and computational costs across various model scales.

Conclusion: SpecFormer sets a new standard for efficient LLM inference, addressing the limitations of traditional speculative decoding methods.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by utilizing otherwise idle computational resources during memory-to-chip data transfer. Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.

*Taewhoo Lee,Minju Song,Chanwoong Yoon,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' ability to encode and apply high-level relational concepts through analogical reasoning, identifying their strengths and limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations, an area not well understood in prior work.

Method: The study uses proportional and story analogies to analyze LLMs' encoding and application of relational concepts.

Result: LLMs can encode relationships but struggle with missing relational information and applying it to new entities. Strategic interventions improve performance, and structural alignment is key to success.

Conclusion: LLMs show emerging but limited capabilities in analogical reasoning, revealing parallels and gaps with human cognition.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities. While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.

TL;DR: BengaliFig is a Bengali dataset evaluating LLMs' figurative and cultural reasoning, revealing gaps in low-resource contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLMs' performance in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially for low-resource languages like Bengali.

Method: Created BengaliFig, a dataset of 435 culturally rich Bengali riddles annotated along multiple dimensions, and tested eight LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: LLMs showed consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning.

Conclusion: BengaliFig serves as a diagnostic tool for LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and promotes inclusive NLP evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models excel on broad multilingual benchmarks but remain to be evaluated extensively in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially in low-resource contexts. We present BengaliFig, a compact yet richly annotated challenge set that targets this gap in Bengali, a widely spoken low-resourced language. The dataset contains 435 unique riddles drawn from Bengali oral and literary traditions. Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a task-oriented framework to evaluate stemming methods, focusing on effectiveness, downstream impact, and semantic similarity, revealing issues with over-stemming in Bangla.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stemming evaluation methods are limited and fail to address potential harm from excessive stemming, necessitating a new comprehensive approach.

Method: A novel framework assesses stemming using SES (effectiveness), MPD (downstream impact), and ANLD (semantic similarity), applied to Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball) stemmers.

Result: Bangla stemmer shows high SES but harmful over-stemming (low ANLD), while English stemmer balances SES and ANLD, proving more reliable.

Conclusion: The framework distinguishes efficiency gains (high SES) from meaning preservation (low ANLD), offering a tool for better stemmer evaluation.

Abstract: Text normalization is an essential preprocessing step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and stemming is one such normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form. However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores using wearable devices and AI to monitor pain spikes in individuals with chronic pain and opioid use disorder, finding machine learning effective but LLMs limited for actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of integrated treatments for chronic pain and opioid use disorder by leveraging wearable devices and AI for real-time monitoring and personalized interventions.

Method: Pilot study using wearable data analyzed with machine learning and large language models to predict and understand pain spikes.

Result: Machine learning models achieved high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs provided limited insights.

Conclusion: Real-time monitoring with wearables and advanced AI can aid early detection of pain spikes, improve care integration, and reduce relapse risk, but LLMs need further development.

Abstract: Chronic pain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD) are common and interrelated chronic medical conditions. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-use agents lack large, high-quality datasets for human-computer interaction, unlike LLMs with abundant textual data.

Method: FaraGen generates diverse tasks, solution attempts, and filters successful trajectories, producing verified data cheaply. Fara-7B is trained on this data, using screenshots for perception and predicted coordinates for action.

Result: Fara-7B outperforms comparable models on benchmarks like WebVoyager and Online-Mind2Web and competes with larger models.

Conclusion: Scalable synthetic data generation like FaraGen enables efficient, small agentic models like Fara-7B, advancing CUAs.

Abstract: Progress in computer use agents (CUAs) has been constrained by the absence of large and high-quality datasets that capture how humans interact with a computer. While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models. We are making Fara-7B open-weight on Microsoft Foundry and HuggingFace, and we are releasing WebTailBench.

TL;DR: KOM, a multi-agent system, automates KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment, improving efficiency and care quality compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KOA affects millions globally, but personalized interventions are resource-intensive. KOM addresses this by automating key tasks in KOA management.

Method: Developed KOM for automated KOA evaluation, prediction, and treatment. Tested its performance vs. general-purpose models and clinician collaboration.

Result: KOM outperformed models in imaging/prescription tasks and reduced diagnostic time by 38.5% when collaborating with clinicians.

Conclusion: KOM enhances KOA care efficiency and quality, offering insights for AI-assisted management of other chronic conditions.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects more than 600 million individuals globally and is associated with significant pain, functional impairment, and disability. While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.

Result: MiniCheck-FISCAL surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo and similar-sized peers, nearing larger systems' accuracy (20x) and rivaling GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on external datasets.

Conclusion: Domain-specific synthetic data and efficient fine-tuning allow compact models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability in financial AI.

Abstract: Financial applications of large language models (LLMs) require factual reliability and computational efficiency, yet current systems often hallucinate details and depend on prohibitively large models. We propose FISCAL (Financial Synthetic Claim-Document Augmented Learning), a modular framework for generating synthetic data tailored to financial fact-checking. Using FISCAL, we generate a dataset called FISCAL-data and use it to train MiniCheck-FISCAL, a lightweight verifier for numerical financial claims.

*Chujie Wang,Zhiyuan Luo,Ruiqi Liu,Can Ran,Shenghua Fan,Xi Chen,Chu He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VICoT is a multimodal agent framework enhancing LLMs' reasoning in remote sensing tasks by integrating visual tools dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from object recognition to complex intelligence reasoning in remote sensing demands better reasoning and tool flexibility.

Method: VICoT uses a stack-based reasoning structure and modular tools for interleaved vision-language reasoning, plus Reasoning Stack distillation.

Result: Experimental results show VICoT surpasses SOTA frameworks in transparency, efficiency, and generation quality.

Conclusion: VICoT advances reasoning capabilities in remote sensing, balancing performance and complexity through distillation.

Abstract: The current remote sensing image analysis task is increasingly evolving from traditional object recognition to complex intelligence reasoning, which places higher requirements on the model's reasoning ability and the flexibility of tool invocation. To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.

*Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi,Pooya Razavi,Sonya Powers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can speed up educational item alignment reviews with high accuracy, especially when paired with candidate filtering, reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human alignment reviews are slow and labor-intensive; LLMs offer a potential solution.

Method: Tested three LLMs on 12,000 item-skill pairs for tasks like identifying misalignments and selecting correct skills, including pre-filtering strategies.

Result: GPT-4o-mini achieved 83-94% accuracy in identifying alignments; pre-filtering improved top-five suggestion accuracy to over 95%.

Conclusion: LLMs with hybrid pipelines (screening + human review) can scalably maintain alignment accuracy.

Abstract: As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance. Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.

TL;DR: VISTA-Gym is a scalable training environment designed to enhance VLMs' visual reasoning by integrating tools and reinforcement learning, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with multi-step visual reasoning and tool integration, limiting their ability to reason through visual interactions.

Method: VISTA-Gym provides a unified interface for visual tools, interaction loops, feedback signals, and trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning. VISTA-R1 is trained using multi-turn trajectory sampling and reinforcement learning.

Result: VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 9.51%-18.72% across 11 VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: VISTA-Gym effectively enhances VLMs' tool-integrated reasoning capabilities, demonstrating its potential for advancing visual reasoning.

Abstract: While recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong image understanding, their ability to "think with images", i.e., to reason through multi-step visual interactions, remains limited. We introduce VISTA-Gym, a scalable training environment for incentivizing tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities in VLMs. VISTA-Gym unifies diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks (7 tasks from 13 datasets in total) with a standardized interface for visual tools (e.g., grounding, parsing), executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning at scale. While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework combines structured intent ontology with compact language models for multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents, achieving near-GPT-4 accuracy with lower resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents by integrating symbolic intent structure into compact language models for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Uses retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing, and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into input/output representations.

Result: A 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation achieves 85% accuracy (vs GPT-4's 90%) with significantly lower energy and memory usage.

Conclusion: Symbolic alignment is effective for accurate and efficient on-device natural language understanding.

Abstract: We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents by integrating a structured intent ontology with compact language models. Our method leverages retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into both input and output representations. We formalize a new evaluation metric-Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS)-based on hierarchical ontology depth, capturing semantic proximity even when predicted intents differ lexically. Experiments on a subset of ambiguous/demanding dialogues of MultiWOZ 2.3 (with oracle labels from GPT-o3) demonstrate that a 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation approaches GPT-4 accuracy (85% vs 90%) at a tiny fraction of the energy and memory footprint. Qualitative comparisons show that ontology-augmented models produce more grounded, disambiguated multi-intent interpretations. Our results validate symbolic alignment as an effective strategy for enabling accurate and efficient on-device NLU.

*Ke Chen,Yifeng Wang,Hassan Almosapeeh,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic prompt evaluation framework and an execution-free evaluator for optimizing prompts dynamically, outperforming existing methods across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-optimization methods are ineffective in dynamic scenarios due to reliance on static templates or unreliable feedback, lacking a unified definition of prompt quality.

Method: Develops a performance-oriented evaluation framework and a text-based evaluator predicting multi-dimensional quality scores. The evaluator guides a metric-aware optimizer for dynamic prompt rewriting.

Result: The evaluator achieves top accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the optimization pipeline consistently outperforms baselines across eight datasets and three models.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified perspective on prompt quality and shows that evaluation-instructed optimization improves performance stably and interpretably across tasks.

Abstract: Most prompt-optimization methods refine a single static template, making them ineffective in complex and dynamic user scenarios. Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.

*Dominik Wagner,Leon Witzman,Luke Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in reinforcement learning (RL) by combining ω-regular objectives with explicit constraints to separate safety requirements and optimization targets, using a model-based RL algorithm for optimal policy synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalar rewards in RL lack expressiveness for complex goals and mask safety-performance trade-offs. ω-regular objectives improve this but still fall short in separating safety and optimization.

Method: Develops a model-based RL algorithm using linear programming to maximize ω-regular objective satisfaction while adhering to ω-regular constraints. Translates to constrained limit-average problems with optimality guarantees.

Result: The algorithm synthesizes policies that satisfy ω-regular objectives and constraints within thresholds, preserving optimality.

Conclusion: Combining ω-regular objectives with constraints enhances RL by clearly separating safety and performance goals, enabling risk-aware optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) commonly relies on scalar rewards with limited ability to express temporal, conditional, or safety-critical goals, and can lead to reward hacking. Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $ω$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.
  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $ω$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $ω$-regular objective while also adhering to $ω$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees.

Motivation: Traditional educational simulations require significant resources and expertise, limiting accessibility. MicroSims aims to democratize simulation creation and improve learning outcomes.

Method: The framework combines standardized design patterns, iframe-based architecture, and transparent code for AI-assisted generation, universal embedding, and customization.

Result: Empirical evidence shows interactive simulations improve conceptual understanding by 30-40%, with MicroSims extending these benefits while reducing barriers.

Conclusion: MicroSims offers a scalable, low-cost solution for equitable education, with potential applications in adaptive learning systems.

Abstract: Educational simulations have long been recognized as powerful tools for enhancing learning outcomes, yet their creation has traditionally required substantial resources and technical expertise. This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand. We discuss implementation considerations, present evidence of effectiveness, and outline future directions for AI-powered adaptive learning systems built on the MicroSim foundation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems lack in multimodal fusion, adaptive communication, and decision transparency for MEIDs in 6G networks.

Method: CC-EIN integrates PerceptiNet for multimodal fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and InDec for interpretability.

Result: Achieves 95.4% task completion and 95% transmission efficiency in post-earthquake rescue simulations.

Conclusion: CC-EIN effectively enhances MEID collaboration, efficiency, and transparency in complex 6G scenarios.

Abstract: In the 6G era, semantic collaboration among multiple embodied intelligent devices (MEIDs) becomes crucial for complex task execution. However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices. Finally, the InDec module enhances decision transparency through Grad-CAM visualization. Simulation results in post-earthquake rescue scenarios demonstrate that CC-EIN achieves 95.4% task completion rate and 95% transmission efficiency while maintaining strong semantic consistency and energy efficiency.

*Daniel I Jackson,Emma L Jensen,Syed-Amad Hussain,Emre Sezgin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs simulate self-assessment using the GSES, revealing stable responses but misaligned self-efficacy and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' simulated self-assessment capabilities and how they compare to human norms across different tasks.

Method: Adapted the GSES to ten LLMs across four conditions (no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, summarization), analyzing stability and accuracy.

Result: LLMs showed stable GSES responses but varying self-efficacy levels. Task accuracy was perfect for reasoning but varied for summarization, with self-assessment not reflecting actual performance.

Conclusion: Psychometric prompting reveals LLM communication styles but lacks calibrated performance insights, highlighting misalignment between self-efficacy and ability.

Abstract: Self-assessment is a key aspect of reliable intelligence, yet evaluations of large language models (LLMs) focus mainly on task accuracy. We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations. Psychometric prompting provides structured insight into LLM communication behavior but not calibrated performance estimates.

TL;DR: RPM-MCTS improves code generation by evaluating intermediate steps with knowledge-retrieval and sandbox feedback, reducing errors and token use by ~15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tree search methods struggle with evaluating and correcting intermediate algorithmic steps, leading to incorrect code and high costs.

Method: RPM-MCTS uses Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model with Monte Carlo Tree Search, similarity filtering for diversity, and sandbox feedback for error correction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, reduces token use by ~15%, and enhances base model capabilities via fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RPM-MCTS effectively addresses evaluation and correction challenges in code generation, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Tree search-based methods have made significant progress in enhancing the code generation capabilities of large language models. However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.

*Qiyao Wei,Edward Morrell,Lea Goetz,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using knowledge graphs to create benchmarks for evaluating semantic similarity in LLM outputs, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic similarity methods may prioritize syntax over semantics, and existing benchmarks are costly, limited, or poorly defined.

Method: Leverages knowledge graphs to generate semantically similar/dissimilar statement pairs across four domains, comparing various similarity methods.

Result: Performance of semantic similarity methods varies by semantic sub-type and domain, with no consistently superior method.

Conclusion: The study highlights implications for using LLM-as-a-judge and provides accessible datasets for further research.

Abstract: Evaluating the open-form textual responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) typically requires measuring the semantic similarity of the response to a (human generated) reference. However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in production, but their failure patterns differ from traditional ML models, and their behavior in real-world settings is poorly understood.

Method: The study identifies 15 failure modes in LLMs, analyzes evaluation gaps, and examines production challenges like observability and cost constraints.

Result: The paper provides a taxonomy of LLM failures, identifies gaps in benchmarks, and outlines principles for reliable system design.

Conclusion: Framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem offers a foundation for future research on robust AI deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly integrated into decision-support tools, automation workflows, and AI-enabled software systems. However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems. By framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem rather than a purely model-centric one, this work provides an analytical foundation for future research on evaluation methodology, AI system robustness, and dependable LLM deployment.

TL;DR: M$^3$Prune is a novel framework for multi-modal multi-agent systems that optimizes communication efficiency by pruning redundant edges, balancing performance and token overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems incur high token overheads and computational costs, hindering large-scale deployment.

Method: M$^3$Prune uses intra-modal graph sparsification to identify critical edges, constructs a dynamic communication topology, and progressively prunes redundant edges.

Result: The method outperforms single-agent and multi-agent systems while reducing token consumption.

Conclusion: M$^3$Prune effectively balances task performance and efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG), which enhance multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with external knowledge, have demonstrated that the collective intelligence of multiple agents can significantly outperform a single model through effective communication. Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPAgent reduces latency in LLM-based search agents by leveraging speculation, achieving faster performance without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based search agents face latency issues due to serialized reasoning and tool execution. Traditional speculation methods add overhead without fully addressing the bottleneck.

Method: SPAgent uses a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism and a two-level scheduler to selectively omit verification and regulate speculative requests.

Result: SPAgent achieves up to 1.65× speedup while maintaining or improving accuracy, enabling practical deployment.

Conclusion: SPAgent effectively reduces latency in search agents through algorithmic and system co-design, making multi-step agents more feasible.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.

Conclusion: Vision-based evaluation enhances CUA reliability and self-correction.

Abstract: Computer Use Agents (CUAs) are designed to autonomously operate digital interfaces, yet they often fail to reliably determine whether a given task has been completed. We present an autonomous evaluation and feedback framework that uses vision-language models to assess task completion directly from screenshots and task descriptions. Our dataset covers 42 built-in macOS applications and 1,260 human-labeled tasks across a wide range of scenarios. Our framework achieves up to 73 percent accuracy in task success detection and yields an average relative improvement of 27 percent in overall task success when evaluator feedback is applied. These results show that vision-based evaluation can serve as an effective feedback mechanism that improves the reliability and self-correction of autonomous computer-use agents.

In this article, we introduce the notion of a quasi-skeleton wiring diagram graph, and prove that quasi-skeleton wiring diagram graphs correspond to Hasse diagrams. Using this result, we designed algorithms that extract wiring diagrams from sequential data. We used our algorithms in analyzing the behavior of an autonomous agent playing a computer game, and the algorithms correctly identified the winning strategies. We compared the performance of our main algorithm with two other algorithms based on standard clustering techniques (DBSCAN and agglomerative hierarchical), including when some of the data was perturbed. Overall, this article brings together techniques in category theory, graph theory, clustering, reinforcement learning, and data engineering.

Result: Ranked 1st in Task 2 API, 2nd in Task 1 API, and 3rd in Task 3 API and GPU track.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances dialogue performance and stability, validated by strong competition results.

Abstract: This report presents the solution and results of our team MSRA\_SC in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC 2025). We propose a simple yet effective framework that unifies improvements across both GPU Track and API Track. Our method centers on two key components. First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool pruning and persona clipping for input compression, combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance. In the final evaluation, our team ranks 1st in Task 2 API, 2nd in Task 1 API, and 3rd in both Task 3 API and GPU track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: CostNav evaluates autonomous delivery robots' economic viability, revealing gaps between navigation success metrics and commercial feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook economic viability, crucial for commercializing autonomous delivery robots.

Method: CostNav models costs (hardware, training, energy, maintenance) and revenue with industry-derived parameters, projecting from simulation to real-world scenarios.

Result: Baseline achieves 43.0% SLA compliance but incurs a $30.009 loss per run due to collision-induced maintenance costs (99.7% of total).

Conclusion: CostNav bridges navigation research and commercial deployment, highlighting collision avoidance as key for economic viability.

Abstract: Existing navigation benchmarks focus on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability -- critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots. We introduce \emph{CostNav}, a \textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\% SLA compliance but is \emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DANCE, a method for generating actionable counterfactual explanations in machine learning, incorporating feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods often overlook complex dependencies in real-world datasets, leading to unrealistic modifications, especially in cybersecurity applications like email marketing.

Method: DANCE integrates linear and nonlinear constraints from data or expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible, actionable, and align with real-world constraints.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in generating meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals, as validated by a case study and extensive evaluation on 140 datasets.

Conclusion: DANCE addresses key limitations in counterfactual explanation methods by balancing plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios like cybersecurity.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance the actionable interpretability of machine learning models by identifying the minimal changes required to achieve a desired outcome of the model. However, existing methods often ignore the complex dependencies in real-world datasets, leading to unrealistic or impractical modifications. Motivated by cybersecurity applications in the email marketing domain, we propose a method for generating Diverse, Actionable, and kNowledge-Constrained Explanations (DANCE), which incorporates feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and real-world feasibility of counterfactuals. Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms. The work is developed based on a real-life case study with Freshmail, the largest email marketing company in Poland and supported by a joint R&D project Sendguard. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation using 140 public datasets, which highlights its ability to generate meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals that outperform other existing approaches based on widely used metrics. The source code for reproduction of the results can be found in a GitHub repository we provide.

### [201] [Improving Language Agents through BREW](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20297)
*Shashank Kirtania,Param Biyani,Priyanshu Gupta,Yasharth Bajpai,Roshni Iyer,Sumit Gulwani,Gustavo Soares*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BREW introduces a framework for optimizing LLM-based agents by refining experiential knowledge into a structured KB, improving task precision and efficiency while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent training methods are computationally expensive and lack interpretability, prompting the need for alternative optimization approaches.

Method: BREW partitions agent memory for efficient retrieval, uses task graders and behavior rubrics for learning, and employs state-space search for robustness.

Result: BREW achieves 10-20% better task precision, reduces API/tool calls by 10-15%, and maintains computational efficiency comparable to base models.

Conclusion: BREW demonstrates that structured memory refinement is a viable, transparent, and extensible method for improving LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly applied to tasks requiring structured reasoning, tool use, and environmental adaptation, such as data manipulation, multistep planning, and computer-use automation. However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.

### [202] [Data Augmentation Techniques to Reverse-Engineer Neural Network Weights from Input-Output Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20312)
*Alexander Beiser,Flavio Martinelli,Wulfram Gerstner,Johanni Brea*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores data augmentation techniques to improve the reverse-engineering of teacher network weights by sampling hidden layer representations, achieving recovery of networks with up to 100 times more parameters than training data points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to recover teacher network weights when the parameters exceed the training data size due to student overfitting. The goal is to better sample the teacher's input-output mapping to elicit richer hidden layer representations.

Method: The authors propose new data augmentation techniques tailored to sample the network's hidden representational space more effectively, moving beyond standard augmentations like rotation or noise addition.

Result: The new augmentation techniques significantly extend the recoverable network size range, demonstrating successful recovery for networks with up to 100 times more parameters than training data points.

Conclusion: Tailored data augmentation can overcome limitations of existing methods, enabling more effective reverse-engineering of larger teacher networks by focusing on hidden layer representations.

Abstract: Network weights can be reverse-engineered given enough informative samples of a network's input-output function. In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers. With our augmentations we extend the state-of-the-art range of recoverable network sizes. To test their scalability, we show that we can recover networks of up to 100 times more parameters than training data-points.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper clarifies active inference by separating it from the Free Energy Principle, proposing constrained divergence minimization for implementation, and noting differences in modeling perception versus action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle active inference from the Free Energy Principle and provide clearer optimization methods.

Method: Formulates optimizations as constrained divergence minimization problems solvable by standard mean field methods.

Result: Shows the proposed criterion aligns with variational free energy for perception but differs for action due to an entropy regularizer.

Conclusion: Active inference can be implemented without relying on expected free energy, with distinct criteria for perception and action.

Abstract: We seek to clarify the concept of active inference by disentangling it from the Free Energy Principle. We show how the optimizations that need to be carried out in order to implement active inference in discrete state spaces can be formulated as constrained divergence minimization problems which can be solved by standard mean field methods that do not appeal to the idea of expected free energy. When it is used to model perception, the perception/action divergence criterion that we propose coincides with variational free energy. When it is used to model action, it differs from an expected free energy functional by an entropy regularizer.

TL;DR: NNGPT is an open-source framework that transforms LLMs into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, integrating multiple LLM-based pipelines to generate, assess, and refine models autonomously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of building self-improving AI systems motivates the development of NNGPT, aiming to automate and enhance neural network development through continuous fine-tuning of LLMs.

Method: NNGPT integrates five LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, HPO, code-aware prediction, NN-RAG, and reinforcement learning, using the LEMUR dataset for reproducible metrics.

Result: NNGPT achieves strong performance, including 73% executability on NN-RAG, 3-shot accuracy boosts, and HPO outperforming Optuna. It has generated over 5K validated models.

Conclusion: NNGPT proves effective as an autonomous AutoML engine, with plans to release code and resources for community use, enhancing reproducibility and accessibility.

Abstract: Building self-improving AI systems remains a fundamental challenge in the AI domain. We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.

*Bo Pang,Chenxi Xu,Jierui Ren,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

TL;DR: VibraVerse introduces a dataset bridging 3D geometry, physical attributes, and acoustic signals, coupled with CLASP, a contrastive learning framework ensuring physical consistency across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal frameworks lack physical consistency and causal relationships between objects' geometry, material, and sound. VibraVerse addresses this gap.

Method: The paper proposes VibraVerse, a dataset with explicit physical properties and geometry, and CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Models trained on VibraVerse show superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization in tasks like geometry-to-sound prediction and sound-guided shape reconstruction.

Conclusion: VibraVerse sets a benchmark for physically consistent multimodal learning, enabling sound-guided perception and deeper understanding of the physical world.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning method using grammatical inference to predict tourist movements based on social network data, focusing on Paris as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding tourist behavior through digital traces on social networks helps improve tourism marketing and decision-making.

Method: Utilizes a grammatical inference algorithm adapted for big data to build a hidden Markov model representing tourist movements.

Result: The method successfully creates a flexible and updatable hidden Markov model for predicting tourist movements.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages social network data to model and predict tourist behavior, demonstrated through the Paris case study.

Abstract: Nowadays, social networks are becoming a popular way of analyzing tourist behavior, thanks to the digital traces left by travelers during their stays on these networks. The massive amount of data generated; by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos during their trip; makes it possible to model their journeys and analyze their behavior. Predicting the next movement of tourists plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support. In this paper, we propose a method to understand and to learn tourists' movements based on social network data analysis to predict future movements. The method relies on a machine learning grammatical inference algorithm. A major contribution in this paper is to adapt the grammatical inference algorithm to the context of big data. Our method produces a hidden Markov model representing the movements of a group of tourists. The hidden Markov model is flexible and editable with new data. The capital city of France, Paris is selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to quantify modality contributions in multimodal models, distinguishing unique, redundant, and synergistic components without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing accuracy-based approaches fail to distinguish whether a modality's contribution is inherently informative or arises through interaction with others, motivating the need for a principled representation-level analysis.

Method: The framework leverages PID and an algorithm based on Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) to decompose predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components, enabling scalable inference-only analysis.

Result: The method provides a clearer, interpretable view of modality contributions at both layer and dataset levels, distinct from outcome-based metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed PID-based framework offers a principled and scalable way to analyze multimodal behavior, improving interpretability and understanding of modality interactions.

Abstract: Quantifying modality contributions in multimodal models remains a challenge, as existing approaches conflate the notion of contribution itself. Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining. This provides a principled, representation-level view of multimodal behavior, offering clearer and more interpretable insights than outcome-based metrics.

*Ruogu Ding,Xin Ning,Ulf Schlichtmann,Weikang Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrefixGPT is a generative Transformer model designed to create optimized prefix adders from scratch, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prefix adders are crucial for high-speed computing, but their design is complex and constrained by rules and vast design spaces. PrefixGPT aims to automate and optimize this process.

Method: PrefixGPT represents adder topologies as 2D coordinate sequences, using legality masks for valid designs. It’s pre-trained on random valid adders, then fine-tuned for optimization.

Result: PrefixGPT discovered a new optimal design with a 7.7% better area-delay product (ADP) and improved exploration quality, reducing average ADP by up to 79.1%.

Conclusion: PrefixGPT demonstrates GPT-style models' potential to master hardware design rules and optimize designs efficiently.

Abstract: Prefix adders are widely used in compute-intensive applications for their high speed. However, designing optimized prefix adders is challenging due to strict design rules and an exponentially large design space. We introduce PrefixGPT, a generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that directly generates optimized prefix adders from scratch. Our approach represents an adder's topology as a two-dimensional coordinate sequence and applies a legality mask during generation, ensuring every design is valid by construction. PrefixGPT features a customized decoder-only Transformer architecture. The model is first pre-trained on a corpus of randomly synthesized valid prefix adders to learn design rules and then fine-tuned to navigate the design space for optimized design quality. Compared with existing works, PrefixGPT not only finds a new optimal design with a 7.7% improved area-delay product (ADP) but exhibits superior exploration quality, lowering the average ADP by up to 79.1%. This demonstrates the potential of GPT-style models to first master complex hardware design principles and then apply them for more efficient design optimization.

TL;DR: WavefrontDiffusion outperforms Standard and BlockDiffusion in text generation by dynamically expanding token updates from finalized positions, maintaining semantic coherence and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising strategies like Standard Diffusion and BlockDiffusion have limitations—Standard Diffusion causes premature predictions, while BlockDiffusion disrupts semantic coherence. A more adaptive approach is needed.

Method: WavefrontDiffusion introduces dynamic decoding, expanding a wavefront of active tokens outward from finalized positions, adapting to semantic flow while keeping computational costs low.

Result: WavefrontDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and code generation benchmarks, producing outputs with higher semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Adaptive scheduling in WavefrontDiffusion leads to more coherent and efficient text generation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for text generation and are becoming a competitive alternative to autoregressive models. The denoising strategy plays an important role in determining the quality of their outputs. Mainstream denoising strategies include Standard Diffusion and BlockDiffusion. Standard Diffusion performs global denoising without restricting the update range, often finalizing incomplete context and causing premature end-of-sequence predictions. BlockDiffusion updates fixed-size blocks in a preset order, but its rigid structure can break apart coherent semantic units and disrupt reasoning. We present WavefrontDiffusion, a dynamic decoding approach that expands a wavefront of active tokens outward from finalized positions. This adaptive process follows the natural flow of semantic structure while keeping computational cost equal to block-based methods. Across four benchmarks in reasoning and code generation, WavefrontDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing outputs with higher semantic fidelity, showing the value of adaptive scheduling for more coherent and efficient generation.

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in LLMs, focusing on pruning and unauthorized fine-tuning, and proposes defense strategies to secure them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE-LLMs' modularity makes them scalable but also vulnerable to adversarial pruning and fine-tuning, bypassing licensing and security.

Method: Develops an expert attribution framework to identify task-critical experts, evaluates pruning impacts, and proposes defense strategies like entangled training and selective fine-tuning.

Result: Finds a trade-off between knowledge loss and recovery: pruning can retain accuracy but requires targeted re-alignment to avoid degradation.

Conclusion: Highlights MoE modularity's dual-use nature, introduces a framework for secure MoE-LLMs, and proposes defenses against unauthorized compression.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are increasingly adopted in large language models (LLMs) for their scalability and efficiency. However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation. By positioning expert pruning as both a threat vector and a defense target, this work highlights the dual-use nature of MoE modularity and provides the first systematic evaluation framework for secure specialization of MoE-LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an XGBoost-based model enhanced by feature engineering and particle swarm optimization to improve retrieval quality in retrieval-augmented generation systems, demonstrating superior performance over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation systems suffer from performance bottlenecks due to low-quality retrievals, leading to distorted outputs. The study aims to enhance retrieval quality to improve answer accuracy.

Method: An XGBoost regression model is developed using feature engineering and particle swarm optimization, focusing on optimizing document relevance and addressing trade-offs among semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity.

Result: The proposed model outperforms baseline methods (decision trees, AdaBoost) in all metrics (lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE; higher R2), indicating better prediction accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: The model effectively optimizes retrieval quality, enhancing generation effects in retrieval-augmented systems, and holds significant value for advancing related technologies.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of large language models, retrieval enhanced generation technology has been widely used due to its ability to integrate external knowledge to improve output accuracy. However, the performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieval module. If the retrieval results have low relevance to user needs or contain noisy information, it will directly lead to distortion of the generated content. In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a trade- off between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model. The R2 value is higher, indicating that its prediction accuracy, stability, and data interpretation ability are more outstanding. This achievement provides an effective path for optimizing the retrieval quality and improving the generation effect of RAG system, and has important value in promoting the implementation and application of related technologies.

TL;DR: OmniTFT is a deep learning framework for forecasting ICU vital signs and lab results, addressing noise, missing data, and biases. It improves performance with novel strategies and achieves strong results across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of vital signs and lab results in ICUs is critical for early intervention and precision medicine, but challenges like noise, missing data, and biases complicate forecasting.

Method: OmniTFT uses Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) with four strategies: sliding window sampling, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage, hierarchical variable selection, and influence-aligned attention calibration.

Result: OmniTFT outperforms existing methods on MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets, with interpretable attention patterns aligned with pathophysiology.

Conclusion: OmniTFT offers a unified, generalizable solution for ICU forecasting, demonstrating clinical utility for decision support.

Abstract: Accurate multivariate time-series prediction of vital signs and laboratory results is crucial for early intervention and precision medicine in intensive care units (ICUs). However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets. Its attention patterns are interpretable and consistent with known pathophysiology, underscoring its potential utility for quantitative decision support in clinical care.

Conclusion: The combined framework outperforms individual approaches, offering better performance for LLM applications.

Abstract: Driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a growing body of work demonstrates the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses in market research and social science applications. Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages. Empirical analysis validates our framework, demonstrating improved estimation and inference performance compared to using either fine-tuning or rectification alone.

TL;DR: The paper extends RF proximities to all supervised distance-based machine learning tasks via the generalized PF model, introduces a regression variant, and showcases its advantages over RF and k-nearest neighbors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To broaden the utility of RF proximities beyond contexts where RF excels, enabling their application in supervised distance-based learning and regression.

Method: Develops the generalized Proximity Forest (PF) model for distance-based tasks and introduces a regression variant. Also proposes using PF as a meta-learning framework for supervised imputation.

Result: Experiments highlight the generalized PF model's superiority over RF and k-nearest neighbors models.

Conclusion: The generalized PF model effectively extends RF proximities to diverse supervised learning tasks, offering practical benefits.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the utility of Random Forest (RF) proximities for various supervised machine learning tasks, including outlier detection, missing data imputation, and visualization. However, the utility of the RF proximities depends upon the success of the RF model, which itself is not the ideal model in all contexts. RF proximities have recently been extended to time series by means of the distance-based Proximity Forest (PF) model, among others, affording time series analysis with the benefits of RF proximities. In this work, we introduce the generalized PF model, thereby extending RF proximities to all contexts in which supervised distance-based machine learning can occur. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the PF model for regression tasks. We also introduce the notion of using the generalized PF model as a meta-learning framework, extending supervised imputation capability to any pre-trained classifier. We experimentally demonstrate the unique advantages of the generalized PF model compared with both the RF model and the $k$-nearest neighbors model.

*Guijun Liu,Yuwen Cao,Tomoaki Ohtsuki,Jiguang He,Shahid Mumtaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GAN-based continual learning approach for CSI feedback in mMIMO-OFDM systems to address dynamic environments and catastrophic forgetting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CSI feedback models fail in dynamic environments due to user mobility and suffer from catastrophic forgetting, necessitating a solution that retains past knowledge.

Method: The method uses a GAN generator as a memory unit to preserve past CSI distributions, enabling adaptation to new scenarios without retraining.

Result: Simulations show improved generalization and low memory overhead, with seamless integration into other advanced CSI feedback models.

Conclusion: The GAN-based approach effectively addresses dynamic environments and forgetting, enhancing DAE framework performance.

Abstract: Deep autoencoder (DAE) frameworks have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting. Simulation results show that the proposed approach enhances the generalization capability of the DAE framework while maintaining low memory overhead. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated with other advanced CSI feedback models, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional machine learning models struggle with closed-world assumptions, limiting their ability to retain and apply knowledge for future tasks in dynamic environments.

Method: The model involves two connected tasks: discovering unknown classes in data and incrementally learning each new class, facilitating continual learning.

Result: The model achieved an average accuracy of 82.54% over four iterations, with a minimum accuracy of 65.87%, surpassing existing open-world learning approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses the challenges of open-world learning, demonstrating robust performance and adaptability in continuous learning scenarios.

Abstract: Open-world machine learning is an emerging technique in artificial intelligence, where conventional machine learning models often follow closed-world assumptions, which can hinder their ability to retain previously learned knowledge for future tasks. However, automated intelligence systems must learn about novel classes and previously known tasks. The proposed model offers novel learning classes in an open and continuous learning environment. It consists of two different but connected tasks. First, it discovers unknown classes in the data and creates novel classes; next, it learns how to perform class incrementally for each new class. Together, they enable continual learning, allowing the system to expand its understanding of the data and improve over time. The proposed model also outperformed existing approaches in open-world learning. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong performance in continuous learning, achieving a highest average accuracy of 82.54% over four iterations and a minimum accuracy of 65.87%.

TL;DR: This paper explores the interactions and optimal sequencing of model compression techniques (knowledge distillation, pruning, quantization) for LLMs, concluding that the sequence P-KD-Q is most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deploy LLMs efficiently in resource-limited environments by understanding how compression techniques interact and perform in combination.

Method: Systematically evaluates single and combined compression techniques on the Qwen2.5 3B model, measuring perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio.

Result: Quantization offers the highest standalone compression, pruning causes moderate quality loss, and the P-KD-Q sequence achieves the best balance (3.68x compression with preserved capabilities).

Conclusion: The ordering of compression techniques significantly impacts model quality; P-KD-Q is optimal, while early quantization harms performance. Provides guidance for deploying LLMs in constrained settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources, making model compression essential for efficient deployment in constrained environments. Among the dominant compression techniques: knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization, their individual effects are well studied, but their interactions and optimal sequencing remain unclear. This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training. Overall, this study offers practical insight into designing effective, ordering-aware compression pipelines for deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the impracticality of large language models for edge or cost-sensitive deployments by developing a smaller, efficient model.

Method: Utilizes maximal-update parameterization (μP) for hyper-parameter transfer, a Warmup--Stable--Decay curriculum, and switches from AdamW to Muon optimizer during decay. FP8-mixed-precision training ensures balance between accuracy and throughput.

Result: Achieves a 4.58% improvement in reasoning tasks by switching optimizers and maintains efficiency through FP8 training.

Conclusion: Xmodel-2.5 demonstrates robust performance with reduced computational demands, making it suitable for edge deployments, with open-source resources provided.

Abstract: Large language models deliver strong reasoning and tool-use skills, yet their computational demands make them impractical for edge or cost-sensitive deployments. We present \textbf{Xmodel-2.5}, a 1.3-billion-parameter small language model designed as a \emph{drop-in agent core}. Training with maximal-update parameterization ($μ$P) allows hyper-parameters tuned on a 20M-parameter proxy to transfer directly to the full model, even under the parameter-tied \emph{tie-word-embedding} architecture. A 1.4T-token Warmup--Stable--Decay curriculum is used, and we further show that \textbf{switching from AdamW to Muon during the decay phase} improves the 13-task reasoning average by 4.58\,\% while keeping every other hyper-parameter fixed, verifying that early AdamW stability can be paired with late Muon sharpening for better downstream performance.

TL;DR: PeriodNet introduces a novel structure with period attention and sparse period mechanisms for time series forecasting, outperforming six state-of-the-art models with a 22% improvement for long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite attention mechanisms' success in NLP (e.g., BERT, GPT), their application in time series forecasting (TSF) has underperformed. Enhancing attention networks for TSF is crucial across domains.

Method: PeriodNet uses period attention and sparse period mechanisms for analyzing adjacent periods, an iterative grouping mechanism to reduce cross-variable redundancy, and a redesigned Transformer architecture with a period diffuser.

Result: PeriodNet surpasses six state-of-the-art models in univariate and multivariate TSF, achieving a 22% improvement for sequences of length 720.

Conclusion: PeriodNet's innovative design effectively mines local and global dependencies in time series, demonstrating superior performance in forecasting tasks.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has demonstrated remarkable potential in sequence modeling, exemplified by its successful application in natural language processing with models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Despite these advancements, its utilization in time series forecasting (TSF) has yet to meet expectations. Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error. In particular, PeriodNet achieves a relative improvement of 22% when forecasting time series with a length of 720, in comparison to other models based on the conventional encoder-decoder Transformer architecture.

Motivation: To address privacy risks in LLMs due to memorization of sensitive healthcare data, ensuring compliance and ethical standards.

Result: Achieves 82.7% forgetting rate and 88.5% knowledge preservation, modifying only 0.1% of parameters.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances privacy and performance, meeting regulatory and ethical needs in clinical research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but pose substantial privacy risks due to training data memorization, particularly within healthcare contexts involving imperfect or privacy-sensitive patient information. We present a hierarchical dual-strategy framework for selective knowledge unlearning that precisely removes specialized knowledge while preserving fundamental medical competencies. Our approach synergistically integrates geometric-constrained gradient updates to selectively modulate target parameters with concept-aware token-level interventions that distinguish between preservation-critical and unlearning-targeted tokens via a unified four-level medical concept hierarchy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MedMCQA (surgical) and MHQA (anxiety, depression, trauma) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving an 82.7% forgetting rate and 88.5% knowledge preservation. Notably, our framework maintains robust privacy guarantees while requiring modification of only 0.1% of parameters, addressing critical needs for regulatory compliance, auditability, and ethical standards in clinical research.

*Hong-Hanh Nguyen-Le,Van-Tuan Tran,Dinh-Thuc Nguyen,Nhien-An Le-Khac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting synthetic images across different architectures (GANs and DMs) by proposing TriDetect, a semi-supervised method that leverages architectural patterns for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors fail to generalize across different synthetic image generators due to distinct artifacts produced by GANs and DMs, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Proposes TriDetect, combining balanced cluster assignment (Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm) and cross-view consistency to learn architectural differences within synthetic images.

Result: TriDetect outperforms 13 baselines on standard benchmarks and in-the-wild datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen generators.

Conclusion: TriDetect effectively bridges the generalization gap in detecting synthetic images across GANs and DMs by leveraging architectural patterns.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generators (e.g., StyleGAN, Midjourney, DALL-E) has produced highly realistic synthetic images, posing significant challenges to digital media authenticity. These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the "fake" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.

*Subramanyam Sahoo,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Divya Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Alignment Trilemma in RLHF, proving that achieving representativeness, tractability, and robustness simultaneously is impossible. Current implementations sacrifice representativeness, leading to documented issues like bias amplification. The paper suggests strategic relaxations of alignment requirements as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the persistent challenge in RLHF where improving safety often compromises fairness or scalability, and robustness amplifies biases. The paper aims to formalize these trade-offs and explain observed pathologies.

Method: The method involves a complexity-theoretic analysis combining statistical learning theory and robust optimization to prove the Alignment Trilemma. It evaluates current RLHF implementations' limitations in representativeness.

Result: The results show that achieving both representativeness and robustness requires super-polynomial operations (Ω(2^{d_context})). Current RLHF implementations sacrifice representativeness, leading to issues like preference collapse and bias.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the inevitability of the Alignment Trilemma and proposes strategic relaxations of alignment requirements to navigate the trade-offs effectively.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used for aligning large language models, yet practitioners face a persistent puzzle: improving safety often reduces fairness, scaling to diverse populations becomes computationally intractable, and making systems robust often amplifies majority biases. We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification. We conclude with concrete directions for navigating these fundamental trade-offs through strategic relaxations of alignment requirements.

*Bing Liu,Boao Kong,Limin Lu,Kun Yuan,Chengcheng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes decentralized learning with heterogeneous node weights, comparing two strategies: embedding weights into local losses (doubly stochastic matrix) and keeping original losses (row-stochastic matrix). Hilbert-space analysis reveals tighter convergence rates, showing row-stochastic matrices incur penalty terms slowing convergence. Conditions are derived for row-stochastic designs to outperform despite smaller spectral gaps, with practical topology-design guidelines provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the fundamental differences between two common strategies for handling heterogeneous node weights in decentralized learning, particularly their convergence behaviors and guarantees.

Method: Develops a weighted Hilbert-space framework to analyze convergence rates, compares doubly stochastic and row-stochastic matrices, and derives conditions for faster convergence using Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparisons.

Result: Hilbert-space analysis yields tighter convergence rates, revealing penalty terms in row-stochastic designs that slow consensus. Sufficient conditions for row-stochastic designs to outperform are identified, along with topology-design guidelines.

Conclusion: The row-stochastic strategy's convergence is slower due to penalty terms, but under certain conditions (e.g., spectral properties and topology), it can outperform the doubly stochastic approach. Practical guidelines for topology design are provided.

Abstract: Decentralized learning often involves a weighted global loss with heterogeneous node weights $λ$. We revisit two natural strategies for incorporating these weights: (i) embedding them into the local losses to retain a uniform weight (and thus a doubly stochastic matrix), and (ii) keeping the original losses while employing a $λ$-induced row-stochastic matrix. Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(λ;\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap. Finally, by using a Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparison, we further obtain topology conditions that guarantee this advantage and yield practical topology-design guidelines.

Motivation: To address the threat of multi-turn conversational attacks exploiting psychological principles and the limitations of manual dataset creation.

Method: Operationalizing FITD techniques into templates to create a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios, evaluating seven models under multi-turn and single-turn conditions.

Result: GPT models are highly vulnerable to conversational history, while Gemini 2.5 Flash is resilient and Claude 3 Haiku shows strong resistance.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical differences in LLMs' contextual robustness and emphasizes the need for defenses against narrative-based manipulation.

Abstract: Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.

*Shivam Pal,Sakshi Varshney,Piyush Rai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple training method to make classifiers ignore shortcut features by injecting targeted noise, achieving top OOD performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often learn shortcuts that fail in OOD scenarios. Existing robust representation methods are complex and brittle.

Method: The approach learns a robust function by injecting anisotropic noise into disentangled latent features to desensitize classifiers to shortcuts.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art OOD performance on shortcut learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Injecting targeted noise in latent space effectively improves robustness against shortcut learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning shortcuts, spurious and easily learned correlations in training data that cause severe failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals. The result is state-of-the-art OOD performance on established shortcut learning benchmarks.

*Yiven,Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neuroeconomics links neural data to welfare analysis, proposing a framework to validate neural evidence for policy use. It emphasizes the need for validated neural-computational mappings, decision models distinguishing true interests from mistakes, and explicit welfare criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgments for policy, not just describe behavior, addressing gaps in current applications.

Method: Develops a non-empirical, model-based framework connecting neural signals, computational decision models, and normative welfare criteria within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model.

Result: Neural evidence constrains welfare judgments only under specific conditions (validated mappings, clear decision models, explicit welfare criteria). A Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist is derived for regulators and NeuroAI designers.

Conclusion: Internal reward signals (biological or artificial) are computational and require normative models for welfare relevance. The framework advances neuroeconomic policy applications while highlighting challenges.

Abstract: Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OS2FS methods struggle with feature evaluation, leading to performance issues in handling incomplete streaming data.

Method: ODESFS combines latent factor analysis for missing data imputation and differential evolution for feature importance evaluation.

Result: Experiments on six datasets show ODESFS outperforms OSFS and OS2FS in feature selection and accuracy.

Conclusion: ODESFS effectively addresses limitations in current methods, offering improved performance for streaming data.

Abstract: The processing of high-dimensional streaming data commonly utilizes online streaming feature selection (OSFS) techniques. However, practical implementations often face challenges with data incompleteness due to equipment failures and technical constraints. Online Sparse Streaming Feature Selection (OS2FS) tackles this issue through latent factor analysis-based missing data imputation. Despite this advancement, existing OS2FS approaches exhibit substantial limitations in feature evaluation, resulting in performance deterioration. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel Online Differential Evolution for Sparse Feature Selection (ODESFS) in data streams, incorporating two key innovations: (1) missing value imputation using a latent factor analysis model, and (2) feature importance evaluation through differential evolution. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that ODESFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art OSFS and OS2FS methods by selecting optimal feature subsets and achieving superior accuracy.

TL;DR: OTMF introduces optimal transport-based masked fusion to merge task-specific models, addressing feature distribution shifts from naive parameter interpolation while preserving task identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods cause distribution shifts in feature space, undermining task-specific knowledge. OTMF aims to solve this by aligning semantic geometries.

Method: OTMF uses optimal transport theory to discover common masks for task vectors, selectively extracting transferable components and preserving structural identities.

Result: OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance on vision and language benchmarks, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: OTMF offers a scalable, efficient solution for merging models, demonstrating practical and theoretical value.

Abstract: Merging models fine-tuned for different tasks into a single unified model has become an increasingly important direction for building versatile, efficient multi-task systems. Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight the practical and theoretical value of our approach to model merging.

### [230] [ModHiFi: Identifying High Fidelity predictive components for Model Modification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19566)
*Dhruva Kashyap,Chaitanya Murti,Pranav K Nayak,Tanay Narshana,Chiranjib Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ModHiFi is a novel algorithm for model modification (pruning/unlearning) without needing gradients, loss functions, or training data. It uses Subset Fidelity to identify critical components, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open weight models lack access to training data or loss functions, limiting modification tasks like pruning or unlearning. Existing methods rely on gradients or labels, which aren't always feasible.

Method: The paper proposes ModHiFi, leveraging Subset Fidelity (based on local reconstruction errors) to identify critical model components without gradients or loss functions. Theoretical bounds are provided for Lipschitz-continuous networks.

Result: ModHiFi-P achieves an 11% speedup in ImageNet pruning and competitive results in language models. ModHiFi-U fully unlearns CIFAR-10 classes without fine-tuning and performs well on Swin Transformers.

Conclusion: ModHiFi efficiently modifies models without traditional dependencies, demonstrating practicality for pruning and unlearning tasks.

Abstract: Open weight models, which are ubiquitous, rarely provide access to their training data or loss function. This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. ModHiFi-U, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inv^2A, a method for language model inversion (LMI) by leveraging latent space invariants, outperforming baselines by 4.77% BLEU score and reducing reliance on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the threat of LMI to privacy and security by exploring consistent semantics in latent spaces.

Method: Inv^2A uses a lightweight inverse encoder and sparse concatenation of outputs, trained in two stages: contrastive alignment and supervised reinforcement.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 4.77% BLEU score across 9 datasets, with reduced dependency on large corpora.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LMI's effectiveness and highlights the limited protection of current defenses, urging stronger strategies.

Abstract: Language model inversion (LMI), i.e., recovering hidden prompts from outputs, emerges as a concrete threat to user privacy and system security. We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora. Our analysis further shows that prevalent defenses provide limited protection, underscoring the need for stronger strategies.

*Jialiang Li,Weitong Chen,Mingyu Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework combines neural models with search-based algorithms to improve solution quality and efficiency in solving NP-hard graph combinatorial optimization problems, outperforming neural solvers alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural models are efficient but lack optimality guarantees. The goal is to merge their speed with the solution quality of search-based methods.

Method: Uses parameterized algorithms (PAs) to identify easy instances and neural models to handle hard parts, integrating advisory signals for efficient search.

Result: Achieves superior solution quality comparable to commercial solvers and better out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances efficiency and solution quality, addressing limitations of neural solvers.

Abstract: Neural models have shown promise in solving NP-hard graph combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.
  We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.
  We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers. Furthermore, by using the neural model only for exploratory advisory signals, our framework exhibits improved out-of-distribution generalization, addressing a key limitation of existing neural CO solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Newt, a multitask agent trained on 200 diverse tasks using online RL and pretraining on demonstrations, showing improved performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scalability in online RL for continuous control by training a single agent across hundreds of tasks.

Method: Pretraining on demonstrations followed by online RL optimization across all tasks, using a language-conditioned multitask world model (Newt).

Result: Newt outperforms baselines in multitask performance, data efficiency, and adaptation to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates scalable online RL for continuous control and releases resources for further research.

Abstract: General-purpose control demands agents that act across many tasks and embodiments, yet research on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control remains dominated by single-task or offline regimes, reinforcing a view that online RL does not scale. Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks. Experiments show that Newt yields better multitask performance and data-efficiency than a set of strong baselines, exhibits strong open-loop control, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks. We release our environments, demonstrations, code for training and evaluation, as well as 200+ checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying diverse reasoning patterns in deep networks (Rashomon Effect) and provide interpretable, equally accurate solutions.

Method: Combines lightweight adapter modules with a diversity-regularized training objective to efficiently learn multiple concept-based models without retraining from scratch.

Result: Produces networks with fundamentally different reasoning processes for the same predictions, revealing variability in concept reliance and decision-making.

Conclusion: The framework enables systematic exploration of reasoning diversity in deep models, supporting auditing, comparison, and alignment across equally accurate solutions.

Abstract: Modern neural networks rarely have a single way to be right. For many tasks, multiple models can achieve identical performance while relying on different features or reasoning patterns, a property known as the Rashomon Effect. However, uncovering this diversity in deep architectures is challenging as their continuous parameter spaces contain countless near-optimal solutions that are numerically distinct but often behaviorally similar. We introduce Rashomon Concept Bottleneck Models, a framework that learns multiple neural networks which are all accurate yet reason through distinct human-understandable concepts. By combining lightweight adapter modules with a diversity-regularized training objective, our method constructs a diverse set of deep concept-based models efficiently without retraining from scratch. The resulting networks provide fundamentally different reasoning processes for the same predictions, revealing how concept reliance and decision making vary across equally performing solutions. Our framework enables systematic exploration of data-driven reasoning diversity in deep models, offering a new mechanism for auditing, comparison, and alignment across equally accurate solutions.

### [235] [Lower Complexity Bounds for Nonconvex-Strongly-Convex Bilevel Optimization with First-Order Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19656)
*Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses lower bounds in bilevel optimization, focusing on nonconvex-strongly-convex settings. It provides new hard instances for deterministic and stochastic oracle models, revealing gaps between upper and lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lower bounds for bilevel optimization are limited due to its complexity. The study aims to fill this gap by focusing on smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex settings and deriving tighter lower bounds.

Method: The authors develop new hard instances for deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. They analyze the required oracle calls for finding ε-accurate stationary points in these settings.

Result: In deterministic cases, a lower bound of Ω(κ^(3/2)ε^(-2)) is proven, surpassing known bounds for single-level and min-max problems. For stochastic cases, Ω(κ^(5/2)ε^(-4)) oracle calls are necessary, improving existing results.

Conclusion: The results highlight significant gaps between current upper and lower bounds in bilevel optimization, suggesting deeper investigation is needed even for simplified regimes like quadratic lower-level objectives.

Abstract: Although upper bound guarantees for bilevel optimization have been widely studied, progress on lower bounds has been limited due to the complexity of the bilevel structure. In this work, we focus on the smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex setting and develop new hard instances that yield nontrivial lower bounds under deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $Ω(κ^{3/2}ε^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $ε$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $Ω(κ^{5/2}ε^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings. Our results expose substantial gaps between current upper and lower bounds for bilevel optimization and suggest that even simplified regimes, such as those with quadratic lower-level objectives, warrant further investigation toward understanding the optimal complexity of bilevel optimization under standard first-order oracles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural models struggle with multi-scale temporal patterns, leading to unstable predictions. This work aims to enhance temporal fidelity and reliability in forecasting.

Method: Proposes a forecast-blur-denoise framework with a learnable Gaussian Process module for smooth perturbations and a refinement model for high-resolution details, trained jointly to avoid artifacts.

Result: Experiments on electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show improved multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows lightweight enhancement for pretrained models.

Conclusion: The framework strengthens fine-scale temporal predictions, contributing to more trustworthy AI systems in forecasting-driven domains like energy and infrastructure.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting remains difficult in real-world settings because temporal patterns operate at multiple scales, from broad contextual trends to fast, fine-grained fluctuations that drive critical decisions. Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios. By strengthening the reliability and interpretability of fine-scale temporal predictions, this framework contributes to more trustworthy AI systems used in forecasting-driven decision support across energy, infrastructure, and other time-critical domains.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new theoretical interpretation of reweighted losses for training diffusion models, improving data-model KL-divergences and demonstrating quality comparable to continuous diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the theoretical understanding and effectiveness of reweighted losses in diffusion models, addressing limitations of the standard evidence lower bound.

Method: Constructs cascade of time-dependent variational lower bounds on data log-likelihood, applicable to continuous Gaussian and masked diffusion models.

Result: Significant improvements in pixel-space image modeling, achieving sample quality comparable to continuous diffusion models.

Conclusion: The framework justifies existing weighting schemes in masked image models and advances the theoretical underpinnings of diffusion model training.

Abstract: We derive a new theoretical interpretation of the reweighted losses that are widely used for training diffusion models. Our method is based on constructing a cascade of time-dependent variational lower bounds on the data log-likelihood, that provably improves upon the standard evidence lower bound and results in reduced data-model KL-divergences. Combining such bounds gives rise to reweighted objectives that can be applied to any generative diffusion model including both continuous Gaussian diffusion and masked (discrete) diffusion models. Then, we showcase this framework in masked diffusion and report significant improvements over previous training losses in pixel-space image modeling, approaching sample quality comparable to continuous diffusion models. Our results also provide a theoretical justification for the simple weighting scheme widely used in masked image models.

*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BlockCert provides certified blockwise extraction and editing of transformer models with formal guarantees on approximation error and coverage, validated on models like GPT-2 and TinyLlama.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of formal guarantees in mechanistic interpretability and model editing by introducing certified methods for transformer mechanisms.

Method: Introduces BlockCert framework for extracting surrogate implementations of transformer blocks with certificates bounding error and coverage, and extends it for certified local edits. Uses Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4.

Result: Achieves high per-block coverage, small residual errors, and matches baseline perplexity closely on TinyLlama.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of certified blockwise extraction for transformers, bridging mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aspires to reverse-engineer neural networks into explicit algorithms, while model editing seeks to modify specific behaviours without retraining. Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour.

Result: Increased abnormal behavior detection performance by 111% and enhanced recommendation models by 104%.

Conclusion: TREASURE is effective as both a standalone model and an embedding provider, offering valuable insights for transaction data applications.

Abstract: Payment networks form the backbone of modern commerce, generating high volumes of transaction records from daily activities. Properly modeling this data can enable applications such as abnormal behavior detection and consumer-level insights for hyper-personalized experiences, ultimately improving people's lives. In this paper, we present TREASURE, TRansformer Engine As Scalable Universal transaction Representation Encoder, a multipurpose transformer-based foundation model specifically designed for transaction data.

TL;DR: TiCT is a transformer-based model pre-trained on synthetic data for in-context time-series classification, achieving competitive results without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of labeled time-series data and the lack of versatile, fine-tuning-free classification models motivate the development of TiCT.

Method: TiCT uses a novel architecture with scalable label encoding and output attention, along with synthetic pre-training combining Mixup and data augmentation.

Result: TiCT performs competitively against state-of-the-art supervised methods on the UCR Archive, using only in-context examples at inference.

Conclusion: TiCT demonstrates that synthetic pre-training and in-context learning can effectively address time-series classification challenges.

Abstract: The ubiquity of time series data creates a strong demand for general-purpose foundation models, yet developing them for classification remains a significant challenge, largely due to the high cost of labeled data. Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance. Extensive evaluations on the UCR Archive show that TiCT achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods. Crucially, this is accomplished using only in-context examples at inference time, without updating a single model weight.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes calibration-free algorithms for post-training quantization of large language models, achieving improved performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantization methods rely on calibration data, which may be unavailable or restricted by privacy laws, limiting their applicability.

Method: Uses proxy functions for quantization loss without calibration data, structured matrix transformations, and dual matrix transformations with adaptive rounding.

Result: Improves benchmark scores for Gemma 2 models (e.g., 4-bit from 61.9 to 62.4, 3-bit from 52.0 to 60.6) with <3% overhead, matching GPTQ's performance without calibration data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective, calibration-free quantization, addressing privacy and data availability limitations while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Post-training quantization is an effective method for reducing the serving cost of large language models, where the standard approach is to use a round-to-nearest quantization level scheme. However, this often introduces large errors due to outliers in the weights. Proposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in some real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods. We conduct experiments on Gemma 2 models, and observe consistent improvement over the baselines. For Gemma 2 9B quantization, our method improves the average benchmark score from 61.9 to 62.4 for 4-bit quantization and from 52.0 to 60.6 for 3-bit quantization, while adding less than 3% of computation overhead. Furthermore, our method achieves performance comparable to the commonly used GPTQ method, which requires calibration data.

TL;DR: LLM-AL, an active learning framework using large language models, reduces experiments by over 70% and outperforms traditional ML models in materials science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML models in active learning have cold-start limitations and lack generalizability due to domain-specific feature engineering.

Method: LLM-AL operates iteratively in a few-shot setting, using two prompting strategies: concise numerical inputs and expanded descriptive text.

Result: LLM-AL achieved broader searches, reached optima faster, and showed stable performance across runs, reducing needed experiments by over 70%.

Conclusion: LLM-AL is a generalizable, efficient, and interpretable alternative to conventional AL pipelines, enabling potential autonomous discovery.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) accelerates scientific discovery by prioritizing the most informative experiments, but traditional machine learning (ML) models used in AL suffer from cold-start limitations and domain-specific feature engineering, restricting their generalizability. Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data sharing barriers like privacy and legal constraints limit statistical power and create inequitable access to accurate predictive models.

Method: DISCO uses federated or decentralized learning paradigms, local browser-based training, and flexible weight aggregation strategies for model personalization and bias resilience.

Result: DISCO enables collaborative model building with privacy guarantees, no programming skills required, and cross-platform accessibility.

Conclusion: DISCO addresses data sharing challenges by providing an equitable, user-friendly solution for distributed collaborative learning.

Abstract: Data is often impractical to share for a range of well considered reasons, such as concerns over privacy, intellectual property, and legal constraints. This not only fragments the statistical power of predictive models, but creates an accessibility bias, where accuracy becomes inequitably distributed to those who have the resources to overcome these concerns. We present DISCO: an open-source DIStributed COllaborative learning platform accessible to non-technical users, offering a means to collaboratively build machine learning models without sharing any original data or requiring any programming knowledge. DISCO's web application trains models locally directly in the browser, making our tool cross-platform out-of-the-box, including smartphones. The modular design of \disco offers choices between federated and decentralized paradigms, various levels of privacy guarantees and several approaches to weight aggregation strategies that allow for model personalization and bias resilience in the collaborative training.

### [244] [When +1% Is Not Enough: A Paired Bootstrap Protocol for Evaluating Small Improvements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19794)
*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current ML practices for reporting small performance gains without uncertainty estimates, proposing a conservative evaluation protocol to prevent over-claiming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning evaluations often report minor improvements (1-2%) without accounting for noise, raising concerns about the validity of such claims. The authors aim to address this by introducing a robust evaluation method.

Method: The authors propose a protocol using paired multi-seed runs, BCa bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. This method is designed to be conservative and computationally efficient.

Result: Testing on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News, the protocol avoids falsely declaring significance for small gains (0.6-2.0 points) even with only three seeds, unlike single runs or unpaired t-tests.

Conclusion: The conservative evaluation protocol is recommended as a safer default for reporting small performance gains under constrained compute budgets.

Abstract: Recent machine learning papers often report 1-2 percentage point improvements from a single run on a benchmark. These gains are highly sensitive to random seeds, data ordering, and implementation details, yet are rarely accompanied by uncertainty estimates or significance tests. It is therefore unclear when a reported +1-2% reflects a real algorithmic advance versus noise.
  We revisit this problem under realistic compute budgets, where only a few runs are affordable. We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.
  We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text. With only three seeds, our paired protocol never declares significance in these settings. We argue that such conservative evaluation is a safer default for small gains under tight budgets.

### [245] [Terminal Velocity Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19797)
*Linqi Zhou,Mathias Parger,Ayaan Haque,Jiaming Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TVM generalizes flow matching for high-fidelity generative modeling, introducing terminal regularization, minimal architectural changes for stability, and efficient attention kernels, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve generative modeling by enabling high-fidelity results with very few function evaluations, addressing limitations of diffusion transformers and flow matching.

Method: TVM extends flow matching by transitioning between diffusion timesteps and regularizing at terminal time. It introduces minimal architectural changes for Lipschitz continuity and a fused attention kernel for efficient Jacobian-Vector Products.

Result: TVM achieves 3.29 FID (1-NFE) and 1.99 FID (4-NFE) on ImageNet-256x256, and 4.32 FID (1-NFE) and 2.94 FID (4-NFE) on ImageNet-512x512.

Conclusion: TVM sets new benchmarks for one/few-step generative models, demonstrating superior performance without requiring pretraining.

Abstract: We propose Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM), a generalization of flow matching that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling. TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.

*Sibo Ma,Julian Nyarko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient data attribution method for modern networks, avoiding costly backpropagation or Hessian inversion by simulating parameter influence during training and using forward evaluations for queries, achieving high accuracy with lower inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable practical data attribution for debugging, auditing, and data valuation in large-scale models without expensive inference-time computations.

Method: Proposes simulating training example influence via short-horizon gradient propagation during training and retrieving attributions using forward passes only.

Result: Matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines like TRAK on attribution metrics (LOO, LDS) with significantly lower inference costs.

Conclusion: Combines influence-function fidelity with scalability, offering a practical solution for real-time data attribution in large pretrained models.

Abstract: Data attribution seeks to trace model behavior back to the training examples that shaped it, enabling debugging, auditing, and data valuation at scale. Classical influence-function methods offer a principled foundation but remain impractical for modern networks because they require expensive backpropagation or Hessian inversion at inference. We propose a data attribution method that preserves the same first-order counterfactual target while eliminating per-query backward passes. Our approach simulates each training example's parameter influence through short-horizon gradient propagation during training and later reads out attributions for any query using only forward evaluations. This design shifts computation from inference to simulation, reflecting real deployment regimes where a model may serve billions of user queries but originate from a fixed, finite set of data sources (for example, a large language model trained on diverse corpora while compensating a specific publisher such as the New York Times). Empirically, on standard MLP benchmarks, our estimator matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines such as TRAK on standard attribution metrics (LOO and LDS) while offering orders-of-magnitude lower inference cost. By combining influence-function fidelity with first-order scalability, our method provides a theoretical framework for practical, real-time data attribution in large pretrained models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes RLNLC, a reinforcement learning framework for noisy label correction, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy labels degrade model performance, necessitating effective correction methods.

Method: RLNLC uses reinforcement learning with a state space, action space, and reward mechanism to learn a policy network for label correction.

Result: RLNLC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RLNLC provides an effective solution for noisy label correction via reinforcement learning, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: The challenge of learning with noisy labels is significant in machine learning, as it can severely degrade the performance of prediction models if not addressed properly. This paper introduces a novel framework that conceptualizes noisy label correction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. The proposed approach, Reinforcement Learning for Noisy Label Correction (RLNLC), defines a comprehensive state space representing data and their associated labels, an action space that indicates possible label corrections, and a reward mechanism that evaluates the efficacy of label corrections. RLNLC learns a deep feature representation based policy network to perform label correction through reinforcement learning, utilizing an actor-critic method. The learned policy is subsequently deployed to iteratively correct noisy training labels and facilitate the training of the prediction model. The effectiveness of RLNLC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques for learning with noisy labels.

TL;DR: EfficientXpert is a domain-pruning framework that combines Foresight Mask and Partial Brain Surgeon to transform general pretrained models into sparse, domain-adapted experts efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for domain-specialized LLMs in resource-constrained environments, overcoming the limitations of existing compression methods.

Method: Combines propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) with an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon) integrated into LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity in health and legal tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Highlights the necessity of adaptive, domain-aware pruning strategies due to domain-dependent structural shifts degrading general pruning masks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has increased the demand for domain-specialized variants in areas such as law, healthcare, and finance. However, their large size remains a barrier to deployment in resource-constrained environments, and existing compression methods either generalize poorly across domains or incur high overhead. In this work, we propose \textbf{EfficientXpert}, a lightweight domain-pruning framework that combines a propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) with an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon). Integrated into the LoRA fine-tuning process, EfficientXpert enables a one-step transformation of general pretrained models into sparse, domain-adapted experts. Across health and legal tasks, it retains up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis reveals substantial domain-dependent structural shifts that degrade the effectiveness of general pruning masks, underscoring the need for adaptive, domain-aware pruning strategies tailored to each domain.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RESPIRE, a technique for calibrating low-cost air-quality CO sensors, offering improved accuracy and robustness across diverse settings compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost air-quality sensors are vital for dense monitoring networks, but their calibration is costly and complex, especially in large-scale deployments.

Method: RESPIRE, a novel calibration technique, is proposed, featuring outlier resistance, explainability, and overfitting detection.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate RESPIRE's effectiveness in cross-site, cross-season, and cross-sensor scenarios using data from four sites, two seasons, and six sensor packages.

Conclusion: RESPIRE provides a scalable and reliable solution for calibrating low-cost CO sensors, with open-source code available for broader use.

Abstract: We present a case study for the calibration of Low-cost air-quality (LCAQ) CO sensors from one of the largest multi-site-multi-season-multi-sensor-multi-pollutant mobile air-quality monitoring network deployments in India. LCAQ sensors have been shown to play a critical role in the establishment of dense, expansive air-quality monitoring networks and combating elevated pollution levels. The calibration of LCAQ sensors against regulatory-grade monitors is an expensive, laborious and time-consuming process, especially when a large number of sensors are to be deployed in a geographically diverse layout. In this work, we present the RESPIRE technique to calibrate LCAQ sensors to detect ambient CO (Carbon Monoxide) levels. RESPIRE offers specific advantages over baseline calibration methods popular in literature, such as improved prediction in cross-site, cross-season, and cross-sensor settings. RESPIRE offers a training algorithm that is provably resistant to outliers and an explainable model with the ability to flag instances of model overfitting. Empirical results are presented based on data collected during an extensive deployment spanning four sites, two seasons and six sensor packages. RESPIRE code is available at https://github.com/purushottamkar/respire.

*Areeb Ahmad,Abhinav Joshi,Ashutosh Modi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores fine-grained decomposition of transformer components into singular directions, revealing overlapping subfunctions and distributed computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the internal computations of transformer models by decomposing attention heads and MLPs into orthogonal singular directions.

Method: Decompose transformer components (attention heads and MLPs) into orthogonal singular directions and analyze their subfunctions.

Result: Found that canonical functional heads encode overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions, indicating distributed computations.

Conclusion: Transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously thought, offering new insights for mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit complex and distributed behavior, yet their internal computations remain poorly understood. Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals.

*Zhentao Zhan,Xiaoliang Xu,Jingjing Wang,Junmei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCGSim is a new GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework addressing limitations of node-centric GNN-based approaches by focusing on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based GED approaches miss global structural alignment and misattribute edit costs due to node-centric focus, limiting accuracy.

Method: Proposes GCGSim with graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs to align with GED principles. Includes three core technical contributions.

Result: GCGSim outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks, learning meaningful substructure representations.

Conclusion: GCGSim effectively addresses node-centric limitations, improving GED accuracy and structural understanding.

Abstract: Graph Similarity Computation (GSC) is a fundamental graph related task where Graph Edit Distance (GED) serves as a prevalent metric. GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our comprehensive analyses further validate that the framework effectively learns disentangled and semantically meaningful substructure representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the opaque decision-making processes in LLMs and how they generalize across tasks.

Method: Large-scale study with 28 transformer models, estimating ID across layers and quantifying MCQA task performance per layer.

Result: Early layers use low-dimensional spaces, middle layers expand dimensionality, and later layers compress it, aligning with task decisions.

Conclusion: LLMs implicitly project inputs onto low-dimensional, task-aligned manifolds, offering geometric insights into their generalization and reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong generalization across diverse tasks, yet the internal decision-making processes behind their predictions remain opaque. In this work, we study the geometry of hidden representations in LLMs through the lens of \textit{intrinsic dimension} (ID), focusing specifically on decision-making dynamics in a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) setting. We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations. Together, these results suggest LLMs implicitly learn to project linguistic inputs onto structured, low-dimensional manifolds aligned with task-specific decisions, providing new geometric insights into how generalization and reasoning emerge in language models.

Conclusion: Multiresolution structure enhances forecasting accuracy, especially for observability data, without compromising general performance.

Abstract: We introduce the Cisco Time Series Model, a univariate zero-shot forecaster. This time series foundation model is the result of a general architectural innovation to a time series model enabling it to accept multiresolution input, applied to a popular decoder-only time series model (TimesFM). The resulting multiresolution decoder-only model is trained on over 300B unique data points, with more than half coming from the observability domain. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the resulting model achieves superior performance on observability datasets while retaining very similar performance on a standard general-purpose forecasting benchmark (GIFT-Eval), and suggest that the multiresolution structure enables the model to make more accurate predictions on long context input.

TL;DR: SAPO introduces soft adaptive policy optimization to address high variance and instability in RL for LLMs, outperforming existing methods like GSPO and GRPO in stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of unstable policy optimization in RL for LLMs, particularly due to high variance in token-level importance ratios, which worsens in Mixture-of-Experts models.

Method: SAPO replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate to adaptively attenuate off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals, achieving sequence-coherent and token-adaptive optimization.

Result: Empirical results show SAPO improves training stability and Pass@1 performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and enhances the Qwen3-VL model series across diverse tasks and sizes.

Conclusion: SAPO offers a more reliable, scalable, and effective RL optimization strategy for LLMs compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.

TL;DR: SX-GeoTree is a geospatial regression tree that improves explanation robustness and spatial dependence capture in tabular prediction by integrating impurity reduction, spatial residual control, and modularity maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision trees struggle with capturing spatial dependence and producing locally stable explanations, limiting their effectiveness for geospatial tasks.

Method: SX-GeoTree combines MSE impurity reduction, global Moran's I for spatial control, and modularity maximization on a consensus network from GWR coefficients and SHAP attributions.

Result: SX-GeoTree maintains predictive accuracy (within 0.01 R² of traditional trees) while improving spatial residual evenness and doubling attribution consensus modularity.

Conclusion: The framework embeds spatial similarity in interpretable models, advancing geospatial machine learning and offering a template for domain-aware explainability.

Abstract: Decision trees remain central for tabular prediction but struggle with (i) capturing spatial dependence and (ii) producing locally stable (robust) explanations. We present SX-GeoTree, a self-explaining geospatial regression tree that integrates three coupled objectives during recursive splitting: impurity reduction (MSE), spatial residual control (global Moran's I), and explanation robustness via modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network formed from (a) geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficient distances (stimulus-response similarity) and (b) SHAP attribution distances (explanatory similarity). We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability. The framework demonstrates how spatial similarity - extended beyond geometric proximity through GWR-derived local relationships - can be embedded in interpretable models, advancing trustworthy geospatial machine learning and offering a transferable template for domain-aware explainability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hybrid Split and Federated Learning (HSFL) to combine the strengths of FL (low latency) and SL (high accuracy). It addresses mode selection, batch size interaction, and resource optimization to minimize delay, proposing a two-stage solution validated by improved convergence results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of FL (lower accuracy) and SL (higher delay) by hybridizing them, optimizing resource usage, and accelerating convergence.

Method: Proposes HSFL, analyzes convergence interplay between modes and batch size, formulates a delay minimization problem, and solves it using a two-stage approach (block coordinate descent and rounding algorithm).

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method significantly accelerates convergence to target accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HSFL effectively balances FL and SL advantages, with the proposed optimization framework achieving faster convergence and reduced delay.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two effective distributed learning paradigms in wireless networks, enabling collaborative model training across mobile devices without sharing raw data. While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence to the target accuracy compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored use of survival analysis in modeling recurrent ride-hailing driver behavior and improve risk estimation.

Method: Formulates idle behavior as a recurrent survival process using large-scale data and introduces FACT, which combines Transformer architecture with driver-specific embeddings.

Result: FACT outperforms classical and deep learning survival models with higher time-dependent C-indices and lower Brier Scores.

Conclusion: FACT enables accurate risk estimation, aids platform retention, and offers policy insights.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms are characterized by high-frequency, behavior-driven environments. Although survival analysis has been applied to recurrent events in other domains, its use in modeling ride-hailing driver behavior remains largely unexplored. This study formulates idle behavior as a recurrent survival process using large-scale platform data and proposes a Transformer-based framework that captures long-term temporal dependencies with causal masking and incorporates driver-specific embeddings to model latent heterogeneity. Results on Toronto ride-hailing data demonstrate that the proposed Frailty-Aware Cox Transformer (FACT) achieves the highest time-dependent C-indices and lowest Brier Scores, outperforming classical and deep learning survival models. This approach enables more accurate risk estimation, supports platform retention strategies, and provides policy-relevant insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniGrad is a novel approach achieving universality and adaptivity in online learning, with variants UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman providing regret bounds scaling with gradient variation. UniGrad++ improves computational efficiency with reduced gradient queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack problem-dependent adaptivity, failing to account for gradient variation, which is crucial for applications like stochastic optimization and fast convergence in games. UniGrad addresses this gap.

Method: UniGrad introduces two variants: UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman, both adapting to gradient variation. UniGrad++ further reduces computational overhead by minimizing gradient queries.

Result: UniGrad achieves adaptive regret bounds: O(log V_T) for strongly convex functions, O(d log V_T) for exp-concave functions, and O(sqrt(V_T)) for convex functions. UniGrad++ retains these bounds with just one gradient query per round.

Conclusion: UniGrad bridges universality and adaptivity in online learning, offering improved regret bounds and computational efficiency, making it suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: Universal online learning aims to achieve optimal regret guarantees without requiring prior knowledge of the curvature of online functions. Existing methods have established minimax-optimal regret bounds for universal online learning, where a single algorithm can simultaneously attain $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for convex functions, $\mathcal{O}(d \log T)$ for exp-concave functions, and $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ for strongly convex functions, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $d$ is the dimension of the feasible domain. However, these methods still lack problem-dependent adaptivity. In particular, no universal method provides regret bounds that scale with the gradient variation $V_T$, a key quantity that plays a crucial role in applications such as stochastic optimization and fast-rate convergence in games. In this work, we introduce UniGrad, a novel approach that achieves both universality and adaptivity, with two distinct realizations: UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman. Both methods achieve universal regret guarantees that adapt to gradient variation, simultaneously attaining $\mathcal{O}(\log V_T)$ regret for strongly convex functions and $\mathcal{O}(d \log V_T)$ regret for exp-concave functions. For convex functions, the regret bounds differ: UniGrad.Correct achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_T \log V_T})$ bound while preserving the RVU property that is crucial for fast convergence in online games, whereas UniGrad.Bregman achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_T})$ regret bound through a novel design. Both methods employ a meta algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ base learners, which naturally requires $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ gradient queries per round. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce UniGrad++, which retains the regret while reducing the gradient query to just $1$ per round via surrogate optimization. We further provide various implications.

Motivation: MRF's complex parameter optimization challenges can be addressed using RL for automated, efficient sequence design.

Method: An RL framework is introduced to optimize flip-angle schedules in MRF, generating non-periodic patterns.

Result: The RL-optimized schedule improves fingerprint separability and may allow fewer repetition times.

Conclusion: RL offers a promising solution for MRF sequence optimization, enhancing performance and acquisition speed.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) leverages transient-state signal dynamics generated by the tunable acquisition parameters, making the design of an optimal, robust sequence a complex, high-dimensional sequential decision problem, such as optimizing one of the key parameters, flip angle. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to automate parameter selection, to optimize pulse sequences that maximize the distinguishability of fingerprints across the parameter space. In this work, we introduce an RL framework for optimizing the flip-angle schedule in MRF and demonstrate a learned schedule exhibiting non-periodic patterns that enhances fingerprint separability. Additionally, an interesting observation is that the RL-optimized schedule may enable a reduction in the number of repetition time, potentially accelerate MRF acquisitions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ad hoc methods trade correctness for diversity unevenly across tasks. This work aims to provide a rigorous foundation and a universally superior solution.

Method: The authors formalize the diversity collapse issue, propose differential smoothing reward modification, and validate it theoretically and experimentally.

Result: Differential smoothing outperforms vanilla RL and entropy-based heuristics, showing consistent gains in correctness and diversity across tasks and model sizes.

Conclusion: Differential smoothing is universally superior, with up to 6.7% improvements on benchmarks like AIME24.

Abstract: It is widely recognized that reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models often leads to \textit{diversity collapse}, where outputs lack variety. Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics. Our theory precisely characterizes when existing heuristics help and why they fail, while showing that differential smoothing is universally superior. Extensive experiments with models from 1B to 7B parameters, across domains including CountDown and real-world mathematical reasoning, demonstrate consistent gains. Differential smoothing improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k, with up to 6.7\% improvements on AIME24 dataset.

*Haoran Hu,Junren Shi,Shuo Jiang,Kun Cheng,Xia Yang,Changhao Piao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an integrated Forward Collision Warning (FCW) framework combining a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (HSTAN) and Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment (DTRA) algorithm to address computational complexity, modeling insufficiency, and high false alarm rates, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FCW systems struggle with computational cost for edge deployment and unreliable interaction models, leading to high false alarm rates. This paper aims to overcome these challenges by integrating advanced modeling and adaptive thresholding.

Method: The framework pairs HSTAN (using Graph Attention Network for spatial and cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal modeling) with DTRA (employing Conformalized Quantile Regression and physics-informed risk potential).

Result: Achieves 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods), 0.73m ADE (42.2% better than Social_LSTM), 91.3% prediction interval coverage, 0.912 F1 score, 8.2% false alarm rate, and 2.8s warning lead time.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates high efficacy and practical feasibility for FCW in complex environments, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Forward Collision Warning systems are crucial for vehicle safety and autonomous driving, yet current methods often fail to balance precise multi-agent interaction modeling with real-time decision adaptability, evidenced by the high computational cost for edge deployment and the unreliability stemming from simplified interaction models.To overcome these dual challenges-computational complexity and modeling insufficiency-along with the high false alarm rates of traditional static-threshold warnings, this paper introduces an integrated FCW framework that pairs a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with a Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment algorithm. HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.

*Meiyu Zhong,Noel Teku,Ravi Tandon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses prompt fairness in LLMs, revealing disparities in responses based on phrasing and demographic subgroups. It proposes metrics and interventions to improve fairness and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and quantify disparities in LLM responses due to prompt phrasing and demographic differences, aiming to enhance fairness.

Method: Uses information-theoretic metrics (subgroup sensitivity and cross-group consistency) and proposes interventions like majority voting and prompt neutralization.

Result: Identifies higher variability and divergence in certain subgroups. Interventions reduce cross-group divergence, improving consistency (e.g., largest gap reduced from 0.28 to 0.22).

Conclusion: The proposed methods mitigate disparities, enhancing fairness and stability in LLM responses across diverse user groups.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), though shown to be effective in many applications, can vary significantly in their response quality. In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups.

*Yujia Wang,Yuanpu Cao,Jinghui Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaBlock enhances communication efficiency in federated learning for large language models by parallelizing communication and computation, maintaining performance and convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of high communication latency in federated block coordinate descent schemes for large language models, especially for resource-constrained clients.

Method: Proposes ParaBlock, a novel approach with parallel threads for communication and computation to improve efficiency.

Result: Theoretical proof of achieving the same convergence rate as standard methods, with empirical results showing strong performance and improved communication efficiency.

Conclusion: ParaBlock effectively balances communication and computation in federated learning for large language models, offering practical benefits.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been extensively studied as a privacy-preserving training paradigm. Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning LLMs on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves communication efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedEcho improves asynchronous federated learning by using uncertainty-aware distillation to handle outdated updates and data heterogeneity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asynchronous FL faces challenges like outdated updates from stragglers and bias from faster clients, especially in heterogeneous settings, which existing methods inadequately address.

Method: Proposes FedEcho, a framework using uncertainty-aware distillation to dynamically adjust the influence of straggler clients' predictions based on their reliability.

Result: FedEcho outperforms existing asynchronous FL baselines, achieving robust performance without accessing private client data.

Conclusion: FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity in asynchronous FL, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (FL) has recently gained attention for its enhanced efficiency and scalability, enabling local clients to send model updates to the server at their own pace without waiting for slower participants. However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.

TL;DR: NCGC integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework, leveraging node community signals to improve label scarcity issues, outperforming existing GNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nodes in real graphs form communities with signals useful for semi-supervised classification, unexplored in prior methods, motivating NCGC to exploit these structures.

Method: NCGC combines soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) with a self-supervised clustering module, using multi-task learning to synergize classification and clustering objectives.

Result: NCGC outperforms popular GNN models and recent baselines in semi-supervised node classification across seven real graphs.

Conclusion: NCGC successfully integrates clustering and classification, demonstrating improved performance and model capacity by leveraging community signals.

Abstract: The emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs) has offered a powerful tool for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Subsequent studies have achieved further improvements through refining the message passing schemes in GNN models or exploiting various data augmentation techniques to mitigate limited supervision. In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods.
  Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity. Our extensive experiments showcase that the proposed NCGC framework consistently and considerably outperforms popular GNN models and recent baselines for semi-supervised node classification on seven real graphs, when working with various classic GNN backbones.

TL;DR: CHONKNORIS is a novel neural operator learning paradigm that achieves machine precision by regressing Cholesky factors of elliptic operators, outperforming simpler methods and traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operator learning methods often fail to significantly improve accuracy despite increased complexity, motivating the development of CHONKNORIS.

Method: CHONKNORIS regresses Cholesky factors of Tikhonov-regularized Newton-Kantorovich updates instead of the solution operator, enabling machine-precision behavior through contractive mapping.

Result: CHONKNORIS demonstrates high accuracy on various nonlinear PDE problems, including forward and inverse problems, and introduces a scalable foundation model variant, FONKNORIS.

Conclusion: CHONKNORIS and FONKNORIS advance neural operator learning by combining numerical analysis principles with scalable architectures, achieving machine precision and solving diverse PDEs effectively.

Abstract: Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing sparsity patterns for individual tasks ignores I/O overhead during frequent task switching, necessitating a solution that maximizes parameter reuse.

Method: The framework decomposes weights into reusable block-granular units and aligns sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap, dynamically loading only necessary blocks.

Result: Experiments on an autonomous driving platform show the framework accelerates task switching by over 6.6X compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces switching costs and cold-start latency, making it superior for resource-constrained edge platforms.

Abstract: Sparsity is essential for deploying large models on resource constrained edge platforms. However, optimizing sparsity patterns for individual tasks in isolation ignores the significant I/O overhead incurred during frequent task switching. We introduce an on-demand multi-task sparsity framework specifically designed to minimize switching costs by maximizing parameter reuse. Unlike monolithic approaches, we decompose weights into reusable block-granular units and align sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap. By dynamically loading only the small differential set of blocks required for the next task, our method effectively mitigates the cold-start latency inherent in traditional monolithic approaches.Experiments on a real-world autonomous driving platform demonstrate that our framework achieves superior switching efficiency, accelerating task switching by over 6.6X on average compared to existing sparsity methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RankOOD is a rank-based OOD detection method using Plackett-Luce loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance by leveraging ranking patterns from ID class predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve OOD detection by exploiting the ranking patterns inherent in ID class predictions, which are often overlooked by traditional methods.

Method: RankOOD involves training a model with Cross Entropy Loss to extract rank lists for each class, followed by training with Plackett-Luce loss to predict class ranks. OOD examples are identified by their low probability of respecting these ranks.

Result: RankOOD achieves SOTA performance on TinyImageNet, reducing FPR95 by 4.3%.

Conclusion: RankOOD effectively leverages ranking patterns for OOD detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We propose RankOOD, a rank-based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection approach based on training a model with the Placket-Luce loss, which is now extensively used for preference alignment tasks in foundational models. Our approach is based on the insight that with a deep learning model trained using the Cross Entropy Loss, in-distribution (ID) class prediction induces a ranking pattern for each ID class prediction. The RankOOD framework formalizes the insight by first extracting a rank list for each class using an initial classifier and then uses another round of training with the Plackett-Luce loss, where the class rank, a fixed permutation for each class, is the predicted variable. An OOD example may get assigned with high probability to an ID example, but the probability of it respecting the ranking classification is likely to be small. RankOOD, achieves SOTA performance on the near-ODD TinyImageNet evaluation benchmark, reducing FPR95 by 4.3%.

*Nikit Phadke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REWA introduces a theory of similarity based on witness-overlap structures, showing that monotone witness overlap admits compact encodings with ranking preservation. It unifies various similarity techniques and enables modular construction of similarity systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a general theory unifying diverse similarity measures (graph neighborhoods, causal relations, etc.) under a common framework based on witness overlap, reducing them to compact encodings with provable guarantees.

Method: REWA systems use finite witness sets, semi-random bit assignments, and monotonicity of expected similarity in witness overlap. The framework is compositional, allowing the combination of various transformations into pipelines.

Result: Under an overlap-gap condition, REWA preserves top-k rankings using logarithmic bits. The theory unifies existing techniques (Bloom filters, minhash, etc.) and enables modular similarity system design.

Conclusion: REWA offers a principled foundation for similarity systems, governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering, with broad applicability and potential extensions like weighted witnesses.

Abstract: REWA introduces a general theory of similarity based on witness-overlap structures. We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $Δ(u, v) = |W(u) \cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\log(|V|/δ))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering. This manuscript presents the axioms, the main reducibility theorem, complete proofs with explicit constants, and a detailed discussion of compositional design, limitations, and future extensions including multi-bit encodings, weighted witnesses, and non-set representations.

Motivation: To explore whether general-purpose time-series foundation models can outperform specialized supervised models in zero-shot forecasting for agricultural monitoring.

Method: Comparison of Sundial (a foundation model) with statistical baselines and a fully supervised LSTM on the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022) under various evaluation protocols.

Result: Sundial surpasses LSTMs in zero-shot LAI forecasting when the input context window covers more than one or two seasonal cycles.

Conclusion: Pretrained time-series foundation models like Sundial can serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.

Abstract: This work investigates the zero-shot forecasting capability of time-series foundation models for Leaf Area Index (LAI) forecasting in agricultural monitoring. Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.

TL;DR: iRadioDiff is a diffusion-based framework for constructing high-fidelity indoor radio maps (RMs) using AP positions and physics-informed prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for indoor RM construction face challenges like high latency of EM solvers and limitations of learning-based methods, which struggle with heterogeneous environments and sparse data.

Method: iRadioDiff uses a sampling-free diffusion-based approach, incorporating AP positions, material properties, and multipath-critical priors like diffraction points and LoS contours to guide RM generation.

Result: Experiments show iRadioDiff outperforms existing methods in RM construction and indoor localization, generalizing well across layouts and materials.

Conclusion: iRadioDiff effectively addresses the challenges of indoor RM construction, offering accurate and efficient solutions for localization.

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as environment-aware electromagnetic (EM) representations that connect scenario geometry and material properties to the spatial distribution of signal strength, enabling localization without costly in-situ measurements. However, constructing high-fidelity indoor RMs remains challenging due to the prohibitive latency of EM solvers and the limitations of learning-based methods, which often rely on sparse measurements or assumptions of homogeneous material, which are misaligned with the heterogeneous and multipath-rich nature of indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives. This design enables accurate modeling of nonstationary field discontinuities and efficient construction of physically consistent RMs. Experiments demonstrate that iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor RM construction and received signal strength based indoor localization, which offers effective generalization across layouts and material configurations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual Graph Filtering (DGF), a novel clustering method for Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs) that addresses limitations of existing multi-view clustering by incorporating feature-wise denoising and tri-cross contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view clustering methods fail to handle low correlation and high noise in multimodal attributes from pre-trained models, leading to poor performance.

Method: DGF combines feature-wise denoising with node representation learning and uses tri-cross contrastive training across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities.

Result: DGF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on eight MMAG datasets, achieving superior clustering quality.

Conclusion: DGF effectively addresses the unique challenges of MMAGs, offering robust and discriminative clustering performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs) are an expressive data model for representing the complex interconnections among entities that associate attributes from multiple data modalities (text, images, etc.). Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.
  Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RED-F is a novel framework combining Reconstruction-Elimination and Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting to proactively predict anomalies in multivariate time series by amplifying subtle precursors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised methods fail to detect weak anomaly precursors in normal data due to their bias toward reconstructing normal patterns.

Method: RED-F uses REM for precursor mitigation via hybrid time-frequency analysis, then DFM contrasts purified and original sequences to highlight precursors.

Result: RED-F outperforms existing methods in anomaly prediction across six real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RED-F effectively amplifies precursor signals and improves anomaly prediction robustness.

Abstract: The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in mul- tivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction- Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting frame- work, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future con- text to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficient exploration in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where system dynamics are unknown, and aims to provide a principled and scalable solution.

Method: SOMBRL learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and greedily maximizes a weighted sum of extrinsic reward and epistemic uncertainty, compatible with any policy optimizers or planners.

Result: SOMBRL achieves sublinear regret for nonlinear dynamics in finite-horizon, discounted infinite-horizon, and non-episodic settings, and outperforms baselines in state-based and visual-control environments, including hardware tests.

Conclusion: SOMBRL demonstrates the benefits of principled exploration in MBRL, offering scalability and strong performance across theoretical and practical applications.

Abstract: We address the challenge of efficient exploration in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where the system dynamics are unknown and the RL agent must learn directly from online interactions. We propose Scalable and Optimistic MBRL (SOMBRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. SOMBRL learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and the agent's epistemic uncertainty. SOMBRL is compatible with any policy optimizers or planners, and under common regularity assumptions on the system, we show that SOMBRL has sublinear regret for nonlinear dynamics in the (i) finite-horizon, (ii) discounted infinite-horizon, and (iii) non-episodic settings. Additionally, SOMBRL offers a flexible and scalable solution for principled exploration. We evaluate SOMBRL on state-based and visual-control environments, where it displays strong performance across all tasks and baselines.

TL;DR: CRUX-V introduces a structured intermediate space (CRUX) and a two-stage training framework to improve precise Verilog code generation from ambiguous natural language descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for HDL generation from natural language are ambiguous and unstructured, leading to challenges in accurate Verilog code generation.

Method: Introduces CRUX, a structured intermediate space, and a two-stage training framework (Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization) for precise Verilog generation.

Result: CRUX-V achieves state-of-the-art performance on Verilog generation benchmarks, excelling in complex design tasks.

Conclusion: CRUX effectively bridges the gap between natural language and Verilog generation, proving transferable and beneficial for other code models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve forecasting accuracy and understand Bitcoin volatility using advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: Uses LGBM with 69 predictors and compares it with econometric and ML baselines. Examines two quantile-based approaches for probabilistic forecasting.

Result: LGBM effectively captures Bitcoin's volatility dynamics, with key predictors identified via feature importance techniques.

Conclusion: LGBM models perform well for Bitcoin volatility forecasting and offer interpretable insights into market dynamics.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting of Bitcoin realized volatility. Utilizing a comprehensive set of 69 predictors -- encompassing market, behavioral, and macroeconomic indicators -- we evaluate the performance of LGBM-based models and compare them with both econometric and machine learning baselines. For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization. The results demonstrate that LGBM models effectively capture the nonlinear and high-variance characteristics of cryptocurrency markets while providing interpretable insights into the underlying volatility dynamics.

TL;DR: ClimateAgent is a multi-agent framework automating climate data workflows, outperforming existing tools like GitHub-Copilot and GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic LLM agents and scripting pipelines lack climate-specific context and flexibility, leading to poor performance in climate science.

Method: ClimateAgent uses specialized agents (Orchestrate-Agent, Plan-Agent, Data-Agents, Coding-Agent) to decompose tasks, acquire data, and generate reports with self-correction.

Result: Achieves 100% task completion and a report quality score of 8.32 on Climate-Agent-Bench-85, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration with dynamic API awareness and self-correction enhances reliable climate science automation.

Abstract: Climate science demands automated workflows to transform comprehensive questions into data-driven statements across massive, heterogeneous datasets. However, generic LLM agents and static scripting pipelines lack climate-specific context and flexibility, thus, perform poorly in practice. We present ClimateAgent, an autonomous multi-agent framework that orchestrates end-to-end climate data analytic workflows. ClimateAgent decomposes user questions into executable sub-tasks coordinated by an Orchestrate-Agent and a Plan-Agent; acquires data via specialized Data-Agents that dynamically introspect APIs to synthesize robust download scripts; and completes analysis and reporting with a Coding-Agent that generates Python code, visualizations, and a final report with a built-in self-correction loop. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce Climate-Agent-Bench-85, a benchmark of 85 real-world tasks spanning atmospheric rivers, drought, extreme precipitation, heat waves, sea surface temperature, and tropical cyclones. On Climate-Agent-Bench-85, ClimateAgent achieves 100% task completion and a report quality score of 8.32, outperforming GitHub-Copilot (6.27) and a GPT-5 baseline (3.26). These results demonstrate that our multi-agent orchestration with dynamic API awareness and self-correcting execution substantially advances reliable, end-to-end automation for climate science analytic tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural network compression method using tensor flow divergence to optimize filters and architecture, achieving high compression with maintained accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy in neural networks at both filter and architectural levels using a unified framework based on information flow analysis.

Method: Two-stage optimization: divergence-aware pruning for redundant filters and layer-wise contribution analysis for architectural pruning.

Result: Achieves significant parameter reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy across diverse architectures (CNNs, transformers).

Conclusion: Tensor flow divergence effectively guides optimization for resource-constrained deployments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network compression that addresses redundancy at both the filter and architectural levels through a unified framework grounded in information flow analysis. Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers. The results demonstrate how flow divergence serves as an effective guiding principle for both filter-level and layer-level optimization, offering practical benefits for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Riccardo Zaccone,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy,Carlo Masone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Momentum in distributed SGD, especially in Federated Learning, doesn't guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity and cyclic client participation. Decreasing step-sizes worsen the issue, converging to a constant value dependent on initialization and heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if momentum can overcome statistical heterogeneity in decentralized Federated Learning scenarios with cyclic client participation.

Method: Analyzed momentum theoretically under cyclic client participation, focusing on convergence guarantees and the impact of decreasing step-sizes.

Result: Momentum remains affected by heterogeneity; decreasing step-sizes faster than Θ(1/t) leads to convergence to a constant value, validated by numerical and deep learning experiments.

Conclusion: Momentum alone isn't sufficient to mitigate heterogeneity effects in FL under cyclic participation; alternative strategies are needed.

Abstract: Recent works have explored the use of momentum in local methods to enhance distributed SGD. This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity. Despite recent progress in this direction, it is still unclear if momentum can guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity in decentralized scenarios, where only some workers participate at each round. In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $Θ\left(1/t\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound. Numerical results corroborate the theory, and deep learning experiments confirm its relevance for realistic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks underperform on small datasets compared to tree-based models. AdaCap addresses this gap.

Method: AdaCap employs permutation-based contrastive loss and Tikhonov-based output mapping.

Result: AdaCap shows significant improvements on 85 datasets, especially for residual models, with a meta-predictor identifying beneficial cases.

Conclusion: AdaCap effectively regularizes neural networks for small datasets, enhancing their fragility points.

Abstract: Neural networks struggle on small tabular datasets, where tree-based models remain dominant. We introduce Adaptive Contrastive Approach (AdaCap), a training scheme that combines a permutation-based contrastive loss with a Tikhonov-based closed-form output mapping. Across 85 real-world regression datasets and multiple architectures, AdaCap yields consistent and statistically significant improvements in the small-sample regime, particularly for residual models. A meta-predictor trained on dataset characteristics (size, skewness, noise) accurately anticipates when AdaCap is beneficial. These results show that AdaCap acts as a targeted regularization mechanism, strengthening neural networks precisely where they are most fragile.

### [281] [Learning Subgroups with Maximum Treatment Effects without Causal Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20189)
*Lincen Yang,Zhong Li,Matthijs van Leeuwen,Saber Salehkaleybar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses subgroup discovery for maximum average treatment effects by shifting focus to the structural causal model (SCM) framework, simplifying the problem to standard supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods either rely on inaccurate pointwise estimation or ad-hoc causal heuristics without justification. The authors aim to provide a rigorous, heuristic-free solution under the SCM framework.

Method: The paper reduces subgroup discovery to supervised learning (regression/classification) under a partition-based SCM. It uses CART, a widely adopted tree-based method, to learn optimal subgroups.

Result: Experiments on synthetic/semi-synthetic datasets show the proposed method outperforms baselines in accurately identifying subgroups with maximum treatment effects.

Conclusion: The SCM-based approach avoids causal heuristics and effectively simplifies subgroup discovery, offering a practical solution for targeted decision-making domains.

Abstract: Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.

### [282] [In-Context Compositional Learning via Sparse Coding Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20194)
*Wei Chen,Jingxi Yu,Zichen Miao,Qiang Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing Transformer attention using sparse coding principles to improve performance on compositional learning tasks, demonstrating success on S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack inherent design for compositional tasks and structural inductive bias, prompting a need for improved methods.

Method: Reformulates attention by projecting inputs onto encoding and decoding dictionaries with sparse coefficients to capture compositional rules.

Result: Effectively maintains performance on compositional tasks where standard Transformers fail.

Conclusion: The sparse coding-based attention reformulation enhances Transformers' capability for compositional learning and generalization.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success across language, vision, and multimodal tasks, and there is growing demand for them to address in-context compositional learning tasks. In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets. For certain compositional generalization tasks, our method maintains performance even when standard Transformers fail, owing to its ability to learn and apply compositional rules.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address learning problems in satellite constellations efficiently, minimizing communication overhead while maintaining model accuracy.

Method: Employs federated learning with local data processing, compression techniques to reduce communication size, and an error feedback mechanism for accuracy.

Result: The proposed algorithm shows superior performance in simulations, with improved convergence and reduced communication costs compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The novel approach effectively balances communication efficiency and model accuracy, with potential broader applications due to its algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme.

Abstract: Satellite constellations in low-Earth orbit are now widespread, enabling positioning, Earth imaging, and communications. In this paper we address the solution of learning problems using these satellite constellations. In particular, we focus on a federated approach, where satellites collect and locally process data, with the ground station aggregating local models. We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression). We then propose an error feedback mechanism that enhances accuracy, which yields, as a byproduct, an algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme that can be more broadly applied. We analyze the convergence of the resulting algorithm, and compare it with the state of the art through simulations in a realistic space scenario, showcasing superior performance.

TL;DR: SR-GM introduces gradient decoupling and structural damping to improve multimodal graph condensation, addressing gradient conflicts and structural noise amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal graphs face computational burdens in GNN training due to conflicting gradients and structural noise amplification, which existing GC methods fail to address.

Method: Proposes SR-GM with gradient decoupling (orthogonal projection) and structural damping (Dirichlet energy regularization) to stabilize optimization.

Result: SR-GM outperforms baselines in accuracy and convergence, with strong cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: SR-GM offers a scalable solution for multimodal graph-based learning in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: In critical web applications such as e-commerce and recommendation systems, multimodal graphs integrating rich visual and textual attributes are increasingly central, yet their large scale introduces substantial computational burdens for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search. This research provides a scalable methodology for multimodal graph-based learning in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: RL agents often overfit to training environments, limiting their performance in different settings.

Method: Predict generalizability scores using internal neural network weights and modify PPO loss function accordingly.

Result: Agents trained with the improved PPO show stronger generalizability compared to the original version.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances RL agent generalizability by leveraging weight-based predictions and loss function adjustments.

Abstract: Generalizability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents (ability to perform on environments different from the ones they have been trained on) is a key problem as agents have the tendency to overfit to their training environments. In order to address this problem and offer a solution to increase the generalizability of RL agents, we introduce a new methodology to predict the generalizability score of RL agents based on the internal weights of the agent's neural networks. Using this prediction capability, we propose some changes in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) loss function to boost the generalization score of the agents trained with this upgraded version. Experimental results demonstrate that our improved PPO algorithm yields agents with stronger generalizability compared to the original version.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance the trade-off between performance and interpretability in air pollution forecasting for better public health management.

Method: Proposes a framework with two additive modules: a physics-guided transport kernel (advection) and an explainable attention mechanism for local responses.

Result: Consistently outperforms baselines on Stockholm region data across multiple forecasting horizons.

Conclusion: Integrates high performance with interpretability, offering a reliable tool for air-quality management.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable air pollution forecasting is crucial for public health, but most models face a trade-off between performance and interpretability. This study proposes a physics-guided, interpretable-by-design spatiotemporal learning framework. The model decomposes the spatiotemporal behavior of air pollutant concentrations into two transparent, additive modules. The first is a physics-guided transport kernel with directed weights conditioned on wind and geography (advection). The second is an explainable attention mechanism that learns local responses and attributes future concentrations to specific historical lags and exogenous drivers. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Stockholm region, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple forecasting horizons. Our model's integration of high predictive performance and spatiotemporal interpretability provides a more reliable foundation for operational air-quality management in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Anon is a novel optimizer with tunable adaptivity, bridging SGD and Adam behaviors, and surpassing both in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the generalization gap between adaptive and non-adaptive optimizers by identifying adaptivity in pre-conditioners as a key limitation.

Method: Proposes Anon with continuously tunable adaptivity and introduces incremental delay update (IDU) for robust convergence.

Result: Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks.

Conclusion: Anon unifies adaptive and non-adaptive optimizers, demonstrating adaptivity as a tunable design principle.

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have achieved great success in training large-scale models like large language models and diffusion models. However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity
  , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate the exhaustive RDO search in VVC intra partitioning by leveraging ML techniques, overcoming size limitations and incorporating neighboring block RD costs.

Method: 1) Regression predicts normalized RD costs for CUs. 2) RL models partitioning as an MDP, using DQN to learn CU decisions from trajectories. Both methods apply thresholds for split selection.

Result: Proposed ML techniques are size-independent and utilize neighboring RD costs, offering efficient alternatives to traditional exhaustive searches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective ML-based solutions for VVC intra partitioning, highlighting regression and RL as viable approaches for RDO optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, a complexity study is conducted for Versatile Video Codec (VVC) intra partitioning to accelerate the exhaustive search involved in Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) process. To address this problem, two main machine learning techniques are proposed and compared. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approaches are size independent and incorporate the Rate-Distortion (RD) costs of neighboring blocks as input features. The first method is a regression based technique that predicts normalized RD costs of a given Coding Unit (CU). As partitioning possesses the Markov property, the associated decision-making problem can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by Reinforcement Learning (RL). The second approach is a RL agent learned from trajectories of CU decision across two depths with Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Then a pre-determined thresholds are applied for both methods to select a suitable split for the current CU.

TL;DR: MoRE is a framework using frozen pre-trained transformers and PEFT to align multi-omics data efficiently, achieving robust integration and generalization with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multi-omics data representation like dimensionality, heterogeneity, and batch effects by leveraging pre-trained transformers.

Method: MoRE attaches modality-specific adapters and a fusion layer to a frozen transformer backbone, optimizing masked modeling and alignment losses.

Result: MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: MoRE is a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.

Abstract: Representation learning on multi-omics data is challenging due to extreme dimensionality, modality heterogeneity, and cohort-specific batch effects. While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with scArches, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.

TL;DR: An explainable deep learning model predicts TTX contamination in bivalve mollusks using environmental factors like sun hours, water temperature, and chloride concentration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of TTX contamination is crucial for food safety and economic protection, especially since its drivers in temperate European waters were previously unclear.

Method: Developed a deep learning model with meteorological and hydrological inputs to predict TTX presence or absence in Dutch Zeeland estuary bivalves.

Result: Sunrise/sunset times, global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration were key predictors of TTX contamination, with sun hours being particularly significant.

Conclusion: The model identifies environmental drivers of TTX contamination, offering a valuable tool for mitigating marine toxin risks in the food industry.

Abstract: Since 2012, tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been found in seafoods such as bivalve mollusks in temperate European waters. TTX contamination leads to food safety risks and economic losses, making early prediction of TTX contamination vital to the food industry and competent authorities. Recent studies have pointed to shallow habitats and water temperature as main drivers to TTX contamination in bivalve mollusks. However, the temporal relationships between abiotic factors, biotic factors, and TTX contamination remain unexplored.
  We have developed an explainable, deep learning-based model to predict TTX contamination in the Dutch Zeeland estuary. Inputs for the model were meteorological and hydrological features; output was the presence or absence of TTX contamination.
  Results showed that the time of sunrise, time of sunset, global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration contributed most to TTX contamination. Thus, the effective number of sun hours, represented by day length and global radiation, was an important driver for tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks.
  To conclude, our explainable deep learning model identified the aforementioned environmental factors (number of sun hours, global radiation, water temperature, and water chloride concentration) to be associated with tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks; making our approach a valuable tool to mitigate marine toxin risks for food industry and competent authorities.

*Joël Charles-Rebuffé,Nicolas Gast,Bruno Gaujal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLINQ is a model-based algorithm that efficiently learns Whittle indices for a specific MDP type, outperforming Q-learning in sample efficiency and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing Q-learning approaches by developing a more efficient method for learning Whittle indices in indexable, communicating, and unichain MDPs.

Method: BLINQ builds an empirical estimate of the MDP and uses an extended version of a state-of-the-art algorithm to compute Whittle indices.

Result: BLINQ converges to the desired Whittle indices and provides bounds on learning time. Numerical experiments show it outperforms Q-learning in sample efficiency and computational cost.

Conclusion: BLINQ offers a superior alternative to Q-learning for learning Whittle indices, with proven convergence and efficiency gains.

Abstract: We present BLINQ, a new model-based algorithm that learns the Whittle indices of an indexable, communicating and unichain Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach relies on building an empirical estimate of the MDP and then computing its Whittle indices using an extended version of a state-of-the-art existing algorithm. We provide a proof of convergence to the Whittle indices we want to learn as well as a bound on the time needed to learn them with arbitrary precision. Moreover, we investigate its computational complexity. Our numerical experiments suggest that BLINQ significantly outperforms existing Q-learning approaches in terms of the number of samples needed to get an accurate approximation. In addition, it has a total computational cost even lower than Q-learning for any reasonably high number of samples. These observations persist even when the Q-learning algorithms are speeded up using pre-trained neural networks to predict Q-values.

### [293] [Short-Range Oversquashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20406)
*Yaaqov Mishayev,Yonatan Sverdlov,Tal Amir,Nadav Dym*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MPNNs struggle with oversquashing, not just in long-range tasks but also in short-range ones, revealing two underlying mechanisms. Transformers outperform MPNNs with virtual nodes, offering a better solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of MPNNs in handling oversquashing, particularly in short-range tasks, and to compare their effectiveness with transformers.

Method: Analyzes oversquashing in MPNNs across long- and short-range tasks, identifying bottleneck and vanishing gradient effects. Tests virtual nodes in MPNNs and contrasts with transformers.

Result: Short-range bottleneck effect in MPNNs is distinct and unresolved by virtual nodes; transformers perform better here.

Conclusion: Transformers are superior to specialized MPNNs in mitigating oversquashing, especially in short-range tasks.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques.
  In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks.
  We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.

*Misha Padidar,Teresa Huang,Andrew Giuliani,Marina Spivak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using a conditional diffusion model is proposed to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs, achieving less than 5% deviation from desired characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing fast methods for stellarator design is crucial for advancing fusion research, leveraging large datasets and machine learning.

Method: A conditional diffusion model is trained on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics.

Result: Generated designs show less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and target characteristics, highlighting potential for further improvement.

Conclusion: Generative modeling, particularly diffusion models, offers promising avenues for advancing stellarator design beyond traditional time-consuming methods.

Abstract: Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.

*Shreevanth Krishnaa Gopalakrishnan,Stephen Hailes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of CSI-based deep learning models under adversarial threats, comparing small and large models, and suggests adversarial training as a mitigation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the robustness of CSI-based models is critical for secure and reliable deployment in real-world wireless sensing applications.

Method: A systematic evaluation framework compares compact autoencoder models with larger architectures under various adversarial threat models, including white-box, black-box, and universal perturbations.

Result: Smaller models perform similarly on clean data but are less robust. Physically realizable perturbations reduce attack success, and adversarial training improves robustness with minimal clean performance loss.

Conclusion: The findings provide quantitative robustness benchmarks and design principles for secure human-centered sensing systems.

Abstract: Machine learning has become integral to Channel State Information (CSI)-based human sensing systems and is expected to power applications such as device-free activity recognition and identity detection in future cellular and Wi-Fi generations. However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.
  This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems.

*Kiril Vasilev,Alexandre Misrahi,Eeshaan Jain,Phil F Cheng,Petros Liakopoulos,Olivier Michielin,Michael Moor,Charlotte Bunne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MTBBench introduces a multimodal, longitudinal benchmark simulating Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) to address gaps in current LLM evaluations, revealing LLM shortcomings and offering an agentic framework for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack the complexity of real-world clinical workflows, especially in multimodal, multi-agent decision-making like MTBs, necessitating a more realistic evaluation tool.

Method: MTBBench uses clinically validated, multimodal, longitudinal oncology questions to benchmark LLMs and provides an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools for enhanced reasoning.

Result: Benchmarked LLMs show reliability issues, including hallucinations and struggles with time-resolved data. MTBBench's framework improves performance by up to 9.0% and 11.2%.

Conclusion: MTBBench offers a realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning and tool-use in precision oncology, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for biomedical reasoning, but current benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical workflows. Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively. Overall, MTBBench offers a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning, reliability, and tool-use with a focus on MTB environments in precision oncology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-MicroAdam, a memory-efficient and sparsity-aware adaptive DP optimizer, outperforms existing DP optimizers and matches or surpasses DP-SGD in accuracy across benchmarks, improving performance and stability in differentially private training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DP training relies heavily on DP-SGD, which is computationally expensive and requires significant hyperparameter tuning. Adaptive optimizers, like DP-MicroAdam, aim to address these limitations while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Method: DP-MicroAdam is introduced as an adaptive optimizer designed for DP training. It is memory-efficient and sparsity-aware, with theoretical convergence guarantees for stochastic non-convex optimization.

Result: DP-MicroAdam achieves superior performance compared to existing adaptive DP optimizers and matches or outperforms DP-SGD in benchmarks like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and fine-tuning transformers.

Conclusion: Adaptive optimization, exemplified by DP-MicroAdam, enhances performance and stability in DP training, bridging the gap between non-private and private optimization techniques.

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers are the de facto standard in non-private training as they often enable faster convergence and improved performance. In contrast, differentially private (DP) training is still predominantly performed with DP-SGD, typically requiring extensive compute and hyperparameter tuning. We propose DP-MicroAdam, a memory-efficient and sparsity-aware adaptive DP optimizer. We prove that DP-MicroAdam converges in stochastic non-convex optimization at the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, up to privacy-dependent constants. Empirically, DP-MicroAdam outperforms existing adaptive DP optimizers and achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to DP-SGD across a range of benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, large-scale ImageNet training, and private fine-tuning of pretrained transformers. These results demonstrate that adaptive optimization can improve both performance and stability under differential privacy.

### [300] [Adam Simplified: Bias Correction Simplified](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20516)
*Sam Laing,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the necessity of bias-correction in the Adam optimizer, showing it doesn't improve performance optimally and can sometimes harm it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the misunderstood role of bias-correction in Adam, questioning its universal necessity.

Method: Systematic ablations on vision and language tasks, focusing on hyper-parameter configurations and learning rate scheduling.

Result: Bias-correction offers no performance boost optimally and can be detrimental without proper learning rate scheduling.

Conclusion: The universal inclusion of bias-correction in Adam is unwarranted; its effectiveness depends on hyper-parameters and scheduling.

Abstract: The Adam optimizer is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, yet the empirical necessity of each of its individual components is often taken for granted. This paper presents a focused investigation into the role of bias-correction, a feature whose contribution remains poorly understood. Through a series of systematic ablations on vision and language modelling tasks, we demonstrate that the conventional wisdom surrounding bias correction is misleading. In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $β_1, β_2 \in [0,1)$. Our findings challenge the universal inclusion of this component.

*Alhasan Abdellatif,Hannah P. Menke,Ahmed H. Elsheikh,Florian Doster,Kamaljit Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UFNO-FiLM improves UFNO by decoupling scalar inputs and using a spatially weighted loss, reducing gas saturation MAE by 21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UFNO inefficiently treats scalar inputs as spatially distributed fields and lacks spatial error sensitivity, limiting performance.

Method: UFNO-FiLM uses FiLM to decouple scalar inputs and a spatially weighted loss to prioritize critical regions.

Result: UFNO-FiLM achieves a 21% reduction in gas saturation MAE compared to UFNO.

Conclusion: UFNO-FiLM enhances predictive accuracy by addressing UFNO's inefficiencies.

Abstract: The UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) extends the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by incorporating a parallel UNet pathway, enabling the retention of both high- and low-frequency components. While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions. Our experiments on subsurface multiphase flow demonstrate a 21\% reduction in gas saturation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to UFNO, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy.

*Rui Xue,Shichao Zhu,Liang Qin,Guangmou Pan,Yang Song,Tianfu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E2E-GRec is an end-to-end training framework unifying GNNs and recommender systems, addressing computational overhead and lack of joint optimization in traditional pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage GNN pipelines for recommender systems suffer from high computational costs and suboptimal joint optimization, limiting performance.

Method: E2E-GRec introduces efficient subgraph sampling, a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder for self-supervised learning, and dynamic loss balancing for stable multi-task training.

Result: Offline and online tests show significant improvements, e.g., +0.133% in stay duration and reduced video skips.

Conclusion: E2E-GRec outperforms traditional approaches by enabling end-to-end optimization, enhancing recommendation metrics.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.

*Sumit S Shevtekar,Chandresh K Maurya,Gourab Sil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSTN, a multi-scale temporal network, to address limitations of fixed-scale models in handling non-stationary time-series data. It combines hierarchical feature extraction, sequence modeling, and dynamic fusion, achieving SOTA results across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time-series models often fail to adaptively capture multi-scale temporal dynamics due to fixed structural priors, limiting performance on unpredictable events.

Method: MSTN integrates a multi-scale convolutional encoder, sequence modeling (BiLSTM/Transformer), and a gated fusion mechanism with SE and MHTA for adaptive feature integration.

Result: MSTN outperforms contemporary models like EMTSF and PatchTST, achieving SOTA on 24 of 32 benchmark datasets in forecasting, imputation, and classification tasks.

Conclusion: MSTN's unified multi-scale approach effectively models diverse temporal patterns, demonstrating robust performance across various time-series tasks.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data is highly non stationary and complex in dynamics that operate across multiple timescales, ranging from fast, short-term changes to slow, long-term trends. Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST. In total, MSTN establishes new SOTA performance on 24 of 32 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its consistent performance across diverse temporal tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between adaptive optimizers and normalized steepest descent (NSD), highlighting differences in their geometric assumptions like smoothness. It extends adaptive smoothness theory to nonconvex settings, shows its role in convergence, and demonstrates acceleration with Nesterov momentum. Stochastic optimization is also analyzed using adaptive gradient variance for improved guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between adaptive optimizers and NSD by examining their geometric foundations, particularly smoothness conditions, and to extend these insights to nonconvex and stochastic optimization settings for better theoretical understanding and practical guarantees.

Method: The study extends adaptive smoothness theory to nonconvex optimization and uses it to analyze adaptive optimizers' convergence. It introduces adaptive gradient variance for stochastic optimization and compares it to standard variance assumptions.

Result: Adaptive smoothness precisely characterizes adaptive optimizers' convergence in nonconvex settings and enables acceleration with Nesterov momentum in convex cases. Adaptive gradient variance provides dimension-free guarantees in stochastic optimization.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that adaptive smoothness and gradient variance offer superior theoretical guarantees compared to traditional assumptions, enabling improved convergence and acceleration in both convex and nonconvex optimization problems.

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers can reduce to normalized steepest descent (NSD) when only adapting to the current gradient, suggesting a close connection between the two algorithmic families. A key distinction between their analyses, however, lies in the geometries, e.g., smoothness notions, they rely on. In the convex setting, adaptive optimizers are governed by a stronger adaptive smoothness condition, while NSD relies on the standard notion of smoothness. We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry. We further develop an analogous comparison for stochastic optimization by introducing adaptive gradient variance, which parallels adaptive smoothness and leads to dimension-free convergence guarantees that cannot be achieved under standard gradient variance for certain non-Euclidean geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise control over geometric and topological features in anatomical structures for synthetic dataset design.

Method: Uses cuboidal control domains to slice substructures, computes differentiable penalties, and enforces constraints via voxel-wise moments and persistent homology, implemented in latent diffusion models.

Result: Flexible control over anatomical properties across diverse systems, enabling rational design of synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Anatomica provides efficient and flexible geo-topological control for generating synthetic anatomical datasets.

Abstract: We present Anatomica: an inference-time framework for generating multi-class anatomical voxel maps with localized geo-topological control. During generation, we use cuboidal control domains of varying dimensionality, location, and shape to slice out relevant substructures. These local substructures are used to compute differentiable penalty functions that steer the sample towards target constraints. We control geometric features such as size, shape, and position through voxel-wise moments, while topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids are enforced through persistent homology. Lastly, we implement Anatomica for latent diffusion models, where neural field decoders partially extract substructures, enabling the efficient control of anatomical properties. Anatomica applies flexibly across diverse anatomical systems, composing constraints to control complex structures over arbitrary dimensions and coordinate systems, thereby enabling the rational design of synthetic datasets for virtual trials or machine learning workflows.

*Charlotte Beylier,Hannah Selder,Arthur Fleig,Simon M. Hofmann,Nico Scherf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATOMs (attention-oriented metrics) are introduced to study how reinforcement learning agents develop attention during training, showing different patterns across game variations and phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learning process of RL agents beyond algorithms by analyzing their attention development.

Method: ATOMs were tested on three Pong game variations with behavioral assessments to track attention patterns.

Result: ATOMs revealed distinct attention patterns for each game variant, linking them to behavioral differences and identifying phased development.

Conclusion: ATOMs enhance understanding of RL learning processes and the connection between attention and learning.

Abstract: The learning process of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent remains poorly understood beyond the mathematical formulation of its learning algorithm. To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations. Overall, we believe that ATOM could help improve our understanding of the learning processes of RL agents and better understand the relationship between attention and learning.

TL;DR: The paper explores latent code memorization in diffusion models, identifying non-uniform memorization patterns and proposing a method to rank latent dimensions by their memorization contribution, improving membership inference attack performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the overlooked role of latent codes and auto-encoder geometry in memorization for latent diffusion models (LDMs), aiming to understand and mitigate privacy risks.

Method: A principled method ranks latent dimensions by their contribution to the decoder pullback metric, isolating dimensions most responsible for memorization. This is tested with score-based membership inference attacks.

Result: Removing less-memorizing dimensions improves attack performance, with AUROC gains of 2.7% and TPR@1%FPR increases of 6.42% across datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: The findings reveal the impact of auto-encoder geometry on LDM memorization, offering insights for privacy risk analysis in diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: The recovery of training data from generative models (``model inversion'') has been extensively studied for diffusion models in the data domain. The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization. Empirically, removing less-memorizing dimensions when computing attack statistics for score-based membership inference attacker significantly improves performance, with average AUROC gains of 2.7\% and substantial increases in TPR@1\%FPR (6.42\%) across diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-1K, Pokémon, MS-COCO, and Flickr. This indicates stronger confidence in identifying members under extremely low false-positive tolerance. Our results highlight the overlooked influence of the auto-encoder geometry on LDM memorization and provide a new perspective for analyzing privacy risks in diffusion-based generative models.

TL;DR: The paper investigates prompt injection attacks in AI-powered web browsers, creating a realistic benchmark to evaluate defenses and proposing a multi-layered defense strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the real-world impact of prompt injection attacks on AI agents in browsers, which traditional threat models don't address.

Method: Synthesizing a benchmark of realistic HTML payloads for prompt injection attacks and evaluating existing defenses across AI models.

Result: A multi-layered defense strategy combining architectural and model-based defenses is proposed to counter evolving attacks.

Conclusion: Provides a practical blueprint for securing web agents using a defense-in-depth approach.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into web browsers introduces security challenges that go beyond traditional web application threat models. Prior work has identified prompt injection as a new attack vector for web agents, yet the resulting impact within real-world environments remains insufficiently understood.
  In this work, we examine the landscape of prompt injection attacks and synthesize a benchmark of attacks embedded in realistic HTML payloads. Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models. We propose a multi-layered defense strategy comprising both architectural and model-based defenses to protect against evolving prompt injection attacks. Our work offers a blueprint for designing practical, secure web agents through a defense-in-depth approach.

### [309] [The Driver-Blindness Phenomenon: Why Deep Sequence Models Default to Autocorrelation in Blood Glucose Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20601)
*Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'Driver-Blindness' in deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting, where models fail to leverage key drivers like insulin, meals, and activity. It proposes metrics and solutions to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite known physiological mechanisms, current models overlook clinically informative drivers in blood glucose forecasting. The paper aims to formalize and address this oversight.

Method: The authors introduce $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to measure performance gain from drivers, analyze causes (C1-C3), and suggest mitigation strategies like feature encoders and personalization.

Result: The study finds $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ near zero in literature, attributing it to architectural biases, data gaps, and physiological heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Future work should report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ and adopt proposed strategies to avoid driver-blind models being labeled as state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.

*Shurong Wang,Yuqi Pan,Zhuoyang Shen,Meng Zhang,Hongwei Wang,Guoqi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reframes associative memory retrieval by introducing adaptive similarity, a learned measure that optimizes correctness by approximating the likelihood of stored patterns generating queries, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing associative memory models assess retrieval quality based on proximity, which lacks correctness guarantees for the strongest pattern association. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose adaptive similarity, a mechanism that learns to approximate the likelihood of stored patterns generating queries, and integrate it into an adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop).

Result: Theoretical proofs confirm optimal retrieval for noisy, masked, and biased variants. Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance in diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The adaptive similarity approach enhances associative memory retrieval correctness and versatility, demonstrating superior performance across multiple applications.

Abstract: Associative memory models are content-addressable memory systems fundamental to biological intelligence and are notable for their high interpretability. However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.

*Adam Karvonen,Daniel Reuter,Roy Rinberg,Luke Marks,Adrià Garriga-Alonso,Keri Warr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token-DiFR and Activation-DiFR are methods introduced to verify LLM inference outputs by comparing tokens or activations against a trusted reference, ensuring correctness without additional cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for LLM inference necessitates reliable verification methods to detect errors or tampering, as benign numerical noise complicates traditional verification.

Method: Token-DiFR compares generated tokens to predictions from a trusted reference with synchronized seeds. Activation-DiFR compresses activations into fingerprints for efficient verification.

Result: Token-DiFR detects quantization with AUC > 0.999 within 300 tokens. Activation-DiFR achieves similar accuracy with just 2 tokens, reducing communication overhead by 25-75%.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide efficient and reliable verification for LLM inference, with open-source integration for practical deployment.

Abstract: As demand for LLM inference grows, it is becoming increasingly important that providers and their customers can verify that inference processes are performed correctly, without errors or tampering. However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods. We release an open-source integration with vLLM to accelerate practical deployment of verifiable inference.

*Wei He,Kai Han,Hang Zhou,Hanting Chen,Zhicheng Liu,Xinghao Chen,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROOT is a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer designed to enhance training stability in LLMs through dimension-robust orthogonalization and outlier noise suppression, outperforming existing optimizers in noisy and non-convex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The optimization of large language models faces challenges like sensitivity to algorithmic imprecision and training instability, exacerbated by model scaling. Existing optimizers lack robustness against dimensional fragility and outlier-induced noise.

Method: ROOT employs dual mechanisms: (1) dimension-robust orthogonalization using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients, and (2) proximal optimization to suppress outlier noise while preserving gradient directions.

Result: ROOT demonstrates superior robustness, faster convergence, and better performance compared to Muon and Adam-based optimizers, especially in noisy and non-convex settings.

Conclusion: ROOT introduces a robust optimization framework capable of handling modern large-scale model training complexities, setting a new standard for optimizer precision and stability.

Abstract: The optimization of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly as model scaling exacerbates sensitivity to algorithmic imprecision and training instability. Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training.

*Ziyue Wang,Yayati Jadhav,Peter Pak,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Image2Gcode bypasses CAD modeling by generating G-code directly from 2D images, speeding up prototyping and reducing reliance on manual CAD updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current workflows depend on slow and manual CAD modeling, hindering rapid prototyping and design iteration.

Method: The framework uses a denoising diffusion model to convert Gaussian noise into executable G-code from 2D images.

Result: Image2Gcode eliminates CAD intermediates, enabling faster design-to-fabrication cycles and lowering barriers to additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: This approach enhances accessibility and efficiency in prototyping, repair, and distributed manufacturing.

Abstract: Mechanical design and manufacturing workflows conventionally begin with conceptual design, followed by the creation of a computer-aided design (CAD) model and fabrication through material-extrusion (MEX) printing. This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: TSLEC improves multi-agent communication by using trust-based social learning, reducing convergence time by 23.9% and producing robust protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emergent communication in multi-agent systems relies on independent learning, which is slow and often suboptimal.

Method: Introduced TSLEC, a framework where agents teach strategies based on learned trust relationships, tested over 100 episodes across 30 random seeds.

Result: Trust-based social learning reduced convergence time significantly (23.9%) and produced robust protocols, with trust scores correlating strongly with teaching quality.

Conclusion: Explicit social learning accelerates emergent communication in multi-agent systems effectively.

Abstract: Emergent communication in multi-agent systems typically occurs through independent learning, resulting in slow convergence and potentially suboptimal protocols. We introduce TSLEC (Trust-Based Social Learning with Emergent Communication), a framework where agents explicitly teach successful strategies to peers, with knowledge transfer modulated by learned trust relationships. Through experiments with 100 episodes across 30 random seeds, we demonstrate that trust-based social learning reduces episodes-to-convergence by 23.9% (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.98) compared to independent emergence, while producing compositional protocols (C = 0.38) that remain robust under dynamic objectives (Phi > 0.867 decoding accuracy). Trust scores strongly correlate with teaching quality (r = 0.743, p < 0.001), enabling effective knowledge filtering. Our results establish that explicit social learning fundamentally accelerates emergent communication in multi-agent coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems often rely on static rules and fixed parameters despite operating in dynamic environments. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing a flexible and adaptive learning framework.

Method: The framework includes four dynamic regimes, information-theoretic diagnostics (entropy rate, statistical complexity, predictive information), structural causal models, procedures for generating agent-level priors, and unsupervised methods for identifying behavioral regimes.

Result: The framework provides a structured methodology for analyzing stability, performance, and interpretability across various system dynamics (non-equilibrium, oscillatory, or drifting).

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances the development of explainable and contestable multi-agent decision processes, offering tools for systematic comparison and analysis.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems often operate under feedback, adaptation, and non-stationarity, yet many simulation studies retain static decision rules and fixed control parameters. This paper introduces a general adaptive multi-agent learning framework that integrates: (i) four dynamic regimes distinguishing static versus adaptive agents and fixed versus adaptive system parameters; (ii) information-theoretic diagnostics (entropy rate, statistical complexity, and predictive information) to assess predictability and structure; (iii) structural causal models for explicit intervention semantics; (iv) procedures for generating agent-level priors from aggregate or sample data; and (v) unsupervised methods for identifying emergent behavioral regimes. The framework offers a domain-neutral architecture for analyzing how learning agents and adaptive controls jointly shape system trajectories, enabling systematic comparison of stability, performance, and interpretability across non-equilibrium, oscillatory, or drifting dynamics. Mathematical definitions, computational operators, and an experimental design template are provided, yielding a structured methodology for developing explainable and contestable multi-agent decision processes.

TL;DR: LCDSP introduces a novel LC-RL paradigm for executing high-level instructions in complex environments like football games, using Diverse Style Training and Style Interpreter to translate abstract commands into diverse behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending LC-RL to handle high-level instructions in complex, multi-agent environments like football remains challenging due to their abstract nature.

Method: LCDSP uses Diverse Style Training (DST) to train a single policy with diverse behaviors via style parameters, and a Style Interpreter (SI) to translate language instructions into these parameters.

Result: Experiments in a 5v5 football environment show LCDSP effectively executes diverse behaviors from abstract tactical instructions.

Conclusion: LCDSP demonstrates potential for real-world applications by bridging the gap between high-level language instructions and complex multi-agent behaviors.

Abstract: Despite advancements in language-controlled reinforcement learning (LC-RL) for basic domains and straightforward commands (e.g., object manipulation and navigation), effectively extending LC-RL to comprehend and execute high-level or abstract instructions in complex, multi-agent environments, such as football games, remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we introduce Language-Controlled Diverse Style Policies (LCDSP), a novel LC-RL paradigm specifically designed for complex scenarios. LCDSP comprises two key components: a Diverse Style Training (DST) method and a Style Interpreter (SI). The DST method efficiently trains a single policy capable of exhibiting a wide range of diverse behaviors by modulating agent actions through style parameters (SP). The SI is designed to accurately and rapidly translate high-level language instructions into these corresponding SP. Through extensive experiments in a complex 5v5 football environment, we demonstrate that LCDSP effectively comprehends abstract tactical instructions and accurately executes the desired diverse behavioral styles, showcasing its potential for complex, real-world applications.

### [317] [Realistic gossip in Trust Game on networks: the GODS model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20248)
*Jan Majewski,Francesca Giardini*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Gossip in reputation-based systems is often idealized; this study uses an agent-based model with realistic gossip dynamics and Trust Games, showing that realistic gossiping boosts resources but may favor defection, complicating cooperation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on gossip in cooperative systems often oversimplify its dynamics, assuming perfect information or unrealistic spread, prompting a need for more realistic modeling.

Method: The study employs an agent-based model combining realistic gossip processes with various Trust Game variants to analyze cooperation and defection dynamics.

Result: Realistic gossiping increases resource totals but promotes defection, creating trade-offs for cooperators between competition and growth. Gossip enhances cooperation efficiency significantly when combined with reciprocity and reputations.

Conclusion: Gossiping's realism complicates cooperation strategies by favoring defection in certain contexts, but integrating direct/indirect reciprocity with reputations can dramatically improve cooperative efficiency.

Abstract: Gossip has been shown to be a relatively efficient solution to problems of cooperation in reputation-based systems of exchange, but many studies don't conceptualize gossiping in a realistic way, often assuming near-perfect information or broadcast-like dynamics of its spread. To solve this problem, we developed an agent-based model that pairs realistic gossip processes with different variants of Trust Game. The results show that cooperators suffer when local interactions govern spread of gossip, because they cannot discriminate against defectors. Realistic gossiping increases the overall amount of resources, but is more likely to promote defection. Moreover, even partner selection through dynamic networks can lead to high payoff inequalities among agent types. Cooperators face a choice between outcompeting defectors and overall growth. By blending direct and indirect reciprocity with reputations we show that gossiping increases the efficiency of cooperation by an order of magnitude.
