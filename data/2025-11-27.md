### [1] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores privacy risks in multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs) and introduces a neuroscience-inspired topological regularization framework to enhance their resilience against membership inference attacks (MIA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of multi-modal models (MMs) has raised concerns about privacy leaks, particularly through attacks like MIA. While prior research focused on unimodal systems, this study investigates whether neuro-inspired MMs can better resist such attacks.

Method: The authors propose a topological regularization (tau) framework inspired by neuroscience to analyze VLMs' resilience. They test this on three VLMs (BLIP, PaliGemma 2, ViT-GPT2) using datasets COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps, comparing baseline and neuro VLMs (tau > 0).

Result: Experiments show NEURO VLMs reduce MIA attack success by 24% (mean ROC-AUC) on BLIP with COCO, while maintaining model utility (measured by MPNet and ROUGE-2). Similar results are confirmed with other models and datasets.

Conclusion: Neuro-inspired VLMs demonstrate improved resilience against privacy attacks without compromising utility, contributing to understanding and mitigating privacy risks in MMs.

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

*Inferix Team,Tianyu Feng,Yizeng Han,Jiahao He,Yuanyu He,Xi Lin,Teng Liu,Hanfeng Lu,Jiasheng Tang,Wei Wang,Zhiyuan Wang,Jichao Wu,Mingyang Yang,Yinghao Yu,Zeyu Zhang,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World models like Inferix use semi-autoregressive decoding to generate realistic, interactive videos, advancing beyond LLM-centric vision models with efficient, high-quality generation and real-time interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current video diffusion models and LLM-centric approaches by enabling coherent, stable, and high-quality video synthesis for immersive world simulation.

Method: Employs semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding, combining diffusion and autoregressive methods, with LLM-style KV Cache management for efficient, variable-length generation.

Result: Inferix enables realistic, interactive video streaming and integrates LV-Bench for fine-grained evaluation, setting it apart from high-concurrency and classic diffusion systems.

Conclusion: Inferix represents a breakthrough in world simulation, fostering community collaboration for advancing immersive video generation and world model exploration.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [3] [Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716)
*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LTED-Ada, a hybrid approach combining edge detection and local tracking for video object recognition, optimized using deep reinforcement learning and federated learning for single- and multi-device scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-constrained devices struggle with fast and accurate video object recognition, prompting the need for efficient hybrid solutions leveraging mobile edge computing.

Method: LTED-Ada adaptively selects between edge detection and local tracking using deep reinforcement learning, enhanced by federated learning for multi-device collaboration.

Result: Extensive experiments show LTED-Ada's superiority in balancing frame rate, accuracy, and delay requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed LTED-Ada effectively addresses the challenge of optimizing hybrid video object recognition systems for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [4] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD is a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that reduces inference latency in Vision-Language Action models by evaluating trajectory feasibility and skipping redundant layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Action models face high inference latency due to deep transformer stacks, prompting the need for efficient acceleration without compromising planning quality.

Method: DeeAD uses lightweight planning priors to terminate inference early when trajectories meet feasibility criteria (<2m deviation). It also employs a multi-hop controller to skip redundant layers based on score changes.

Result: Experiments show DeeAD achieves up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction while maintaining planning quality and safety on the Bench2Drive benchmark.

Conclusion: DeeAD effectively accelerates VLA planning without retraining, offering a practical solution for latency-sensitive autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [5] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMD compresses large SSL models into efficient proxies while retaining general-purpose representational power, demonstrated by Foundry for 3D point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impracticality of deploying large foundation models on edge devices due to their size and computational cost, while preserving their generality.

Method: Introduces Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), using Foundry to train students with SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's representations, compressing the latent space.

Result: Distilled models achieve strong transferability across tasks (classification, segmentation, few-shot) with fewer tokens and FLOPs, nearing full foundation-model performance.

Conclusion: FMD successfully creates compact, efficient models suitable for resource-constrained hardware without sacrificing generality.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [6] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer is a DINOv2-based model for detecting manipulated regions in generative inpainting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with robustness to post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve localization of manipulated regions in generative inpainting using DINOv2's strong representational power.

Method: A linear classification head is added to DINOv2's patch embeddings, trained to detect semantic edits. Sliding-window and post-processing refine predictions.

Result: DinoLizer achieves 12% higher IoU than competitors and remains robust to post-processing like resizing or compression.

Conclusion: DinoLizer demonstrates Vision Transformers' effectiveness for manipulation localization, with DINOv2 outperforming DINOv3 in ablation studies.

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [7] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CANVAS, a benchmark evaluating VLMs' ability to use design tools for UI tasks, highlighting their potential collaboration with designers and identifying common errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance VLMs' capacity to operate design software iteratively, addressing the lack of benchmarks for tool-based UI design performance.

Method: Introduces CANVAS, a benchmark with 598 tasks sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs, focusing on design replication and modification via tool invocations.

Result: Leading models show strategic tool usage, improving design quality, while common error patterns are identified for future improvements.

Conclusion: CANVAS highlights VLMs' potential in UI design collaboration and provides insights for enhancing their tool-based capabilities.

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [8] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIE, a Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder, improves vision-language models by generating image representations conditioned on text queries, enhancing performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image encoders process images agnostically, ignoring downstream tasks or text queries, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: TIE generates image representations based on input text queries, optimizing the encoder for query-specific visual features.

Result: TIE-based VLMs outperform conventional models by up to 6 points on benchmarks, use fewer image tokens, and generalize well with generic queries.

Conclusion: TIE enhances performance, efficiency, and interpretability in vision-language models by focusing on query-relevant visual features.

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

### [9] [LongVT: Incentivizing "Thinking with Long Videos" via Native Tool Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20785)
*Zuhao Yang,Sudong Wang,Kaichen Zhang,Keming Wu,Sicong Leng,Yifan Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Shijian Lu,Xingxuan Li,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVT is an agentic framework for long-video reasoning, using multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought to reduce hallucinations by iteratively zooming in on relevant clips, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models struggle with hallucinations in long-form videos due to sparse evidence. LongVT mimics human comprehension by skimming globally and examining clips locally.

Method: LongVT employs an end-to-end framework with interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought, leveraging LMMs' temporal grounding to crop and resample video clips iteratively.

Result: LongVT outperforms baselines on four benchmarks, supported by a curated dataset (VideoSIAH) with 247.9K training samples and 1,280 evaluation QA pairs.

Conclusion: LongVT advances long-video reasoning by combining global-to-local reasoning with iterative grounding, validated by extensive benchmarks and publicly released resources.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

### [10] [Revisiting KRISP: A Lightweight Reproduction and Analysis of Knowledge-Enhanced Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20795)
*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight reproduction of KRISP, a knowledge-enhanced VQA model, uncovering design flaws and offering insights into scalability under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational demands and industrial-scale requirements of KRISP by creating a lightweight version suitable for edge devices.

Method: Replicates KRISP with fewer parameters, evaluates scalability and efficacy through ablation studies on synthetic VQA data and DAQUAR dataset, and confines outputs to a knowledge graph domain to prevent hallucinations.

Result: The replicated model achieves ~75% of KRISP's performance while identifying previously undisclosed design flaws and demonstrating feasibility on edge devices.

Conclusion: Lightweight knowledge-enhanced VQA models can effectively function under resource constraints, providing insights for future scalable architectures.

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

### [11] [Intriguing Properties of Dynamic Sampling Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20800)
*Dario Morle,Reid Zaffino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'warping,' a generalized operator unifying dynamic sampling methods in deep learning, analyzes its statistical properties, and explores training stability and loss landscape visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and theoretically analyze various dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures for computer vision.

Method: Develops a novel 'warping' operator generalizing existing methods, analyzes it statistically using IID variables and homogeneous random fields, and studies training stability and discretization effects.

Result: Demonstrates warping as a minimal, analyzable operator reconstructing existing architectures, reveals training asymmetry, and identifies stable training conditions.

Conclusion: Warping provides a unified framework for dynamic sampling, offering insights into training dynamics and enabling better understanding of learning behavior.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

### [12] [$Δ$-NeRF: Incremental Refinement of Neural Radiance Fields through Residual Control and Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20804)
*Kriti Ghosh,Devjyoti Chakraborty,Lakshmish Ramaswamy,Suchendra M. Bhandarkar,In Kee Kim,Nancy O'Hare,Deepak Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF introduces a modular residual framework for incremental refinement of NeRFs, addressing catastrophic forgetting and reducing training time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining for new views, limiting their use in sequential data scenarios like satellite-based terrain analysis.

Method: Δ-NeRF uses a residual controller, uncertainty-aware gating, and view selection to refine NeRFs incrementally, and employs knowledge distillation for compression.

Result: Δ-NeRF reduces training time by 30-42%, maintains performance, and outperforms baselines by up to 43.5% in PSNR.

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF offers an efficient solution for incremental NeRF refinement, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StM is a novel framework for generative video composition that splits unlabeled videos into foreground/background layers and self-composes them to learn dynamics, outperforming SoTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance control in generative video composition and address data scarcity by leveraging unlabeled videos.

Method: StM splits videos into dynamic layers, self-composes them, and uses transformation-aware training with multi-layer fusion and identity-preservation loss.

Result: StM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: StM effectively learns compositional dynamics for realistic video generation without relying on annotated datasets.

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

*Md Tanvirul Alam,Saksham Aggarwal,Justin Yang Chae,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sphinx is a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning, generating puzzles with verifiable solutions to evaluate and improve models like GPT-5, which currently lags behind humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address gaps in multimodal reasoning by creating a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing visual perception and reasoning tasks.

Method: Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles with motifs, tiles, charts, and geometric primitives, paired with ground-truth solutions. It evaluates models like GPT-5 and introduces reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: GPT-5 achieves only 51.1% accuracy on Sphinx tasks, significantly below human performance. RLVR improves model accuracy and benefits external benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sphinx provides a robust benchmark for visual reasoning, and RLVR shows promise for advancing multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

### [15] [Training-Free Diffusion Priors for Text-to-Image Generation via Optimization-based Visual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20821)
*Samuele Dell'Erba,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) as a training-free alternative to costly diffusion priors in text-to-image generation, proposing two novel constraints for regularization and revealing flaws in current evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to challenge the necessity of expensive and data-intensive diffusion priors in text-to-image generation by offering a simpler, training-free alternative.

Method: The method involves using OVI to initialize latent visual representations from pseudo-tokens and optimize them iteratively with cosine similarity to text embeddings. Two constraints (Mahalanobis-based and Nearest-Neighbor loss) are introduced to regularize the optimization.

Result: Experiments on Kandinsky 2.2 show OVI is a viable alternative to traditional priors. The Nearest-Neighbor approach improves visual fidelity and matches or exceeds state-of-the-art data-efficient priors in quantitative scores.

Conclusion: OVI demonstrates promise as a training-free alternative to diffusion priors, with potential flaws identified in current benchmarks. The Nearest-Neighbor constraint stands out as particularly effective, warranting further investigation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

### [16] [RefTr: Recurrent Refinement of Confluent Trajectories for 3D Vascular Tree Centerline Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20823)
*Roman Naeem,David Hagerman,Jennifer Alvén,Fredrik Kahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr is a 3D image-to-graph model for vascular tree centerline detection using recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories, achieving high recall, precision, and efficiency with fewer parameters compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of tubular tree centerlines (e.g., blood vessels, lung airways) is vital for clinical applications like diagnosis and surgery, where missing branches can lead to critical errors.

Method: RefT uses a Producer-Refiner architecture with a Transformer decoder to propose and refine confluent trajectories, ensuring valid tree topology. A non-maximum suppression algorithm merges duplicate branches for precision.

Result: RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to SOTA methods, with faster inference and fewer parameters, validated on public datasets.

Conclusion: RefTr is a promising SOTA framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging, combining topology-aware refinement with efficiency.

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

*Nisarg K. Trivedi,Vinayak A. Belludi,Li-Yun Wang,Pardis Taghavi,Dante Lok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-resolution stereo DSLR dataset with 18,000 images is introduced to address the lack of real-world optical data for tasks like depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, enabling controlled analysis across diverse optical configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of large-scale, high-fidelity stereo DSLR datasets limits the generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data, particularly for real-world optical conditions in vision systems.

Method: The dataset includes 18,000 images captured with two identical DSLR cameras across 9 scenes, varying focal lengths (28-70mm) and apertures (f/2.8-f/22), totaling 50 optical configurations per scene (2000 images per scene). Dedicated calibration sets are provided for each configuration.

Result: The dataset enables analysis of geometric and optical effects for tasks like depth estimation, deblurring, and 3D scene reconstruction, while highlighting challenges faced by current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This dataset bridges the realism gap between synthetic and real-world optics, supporting reproducible research and revealing limitations in current vision methods.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale unsupervised dataset for visual memorability research, leveraging Reddit's ToT queries. It outperforms state-of-the-art models in recall generation and ToT retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diverse and scalable datasets for visual memorability, which traditionally rely on expensive human annotations.

Method: Utilizes unsupervised data from Reddit's ToT queries to create a dataset of 82,000 videos with recall descriptions. Employs large vision-language models fine-tuned on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperform GPT-4o in generating memorability descriptions and enable multimodal ToT retrieval.

Conclusion: The dataset and models advance visual memorability research by providing scalable, nuanced signals for tasks like recall generation and retrieval.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

### [19] [Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20865)
*Yining Ding,João F. C. Mota,Andrew M. Wallace,Sen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for estimating fog parameters from stereo images simultaneously, outperforming sequential approaches, with a new dataset (SDIRF) for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods estimate fog parameters sequentially, leading to error propagation. Addressing real-world fog's inhomogeneity requires a more robust approach.

Method: Simultaneously estimates all fog parameters via a new optimization problem, assuming local homogeneity of fog. Compatible with SLAM/odometry systems.

Result: Accurate parameter estimation on synthetic and real foggy data (SDIRF dataset), adapting better to real fog than prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves accuracy and adaptability, supported by SDIRF, advancing foggy visual perception research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V^2-SAM is a framework adapting SAM2 for cross-view object correspondence using two prompt generators and a multi-expert design, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models struggle with cross-view object correspondence due to viewpoint and appearance variations.

Method: V^2-SAM uses Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor) and Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) to handle geometry-aware and appearance-guided cues, respectively, along with a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) for reliability.

Result: V^2-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D, DAVIS-2017, and HANDAL-X benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses cross-view challenges and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Null-TTA aligns diffusion models by optimizing unconditional embeddings in classifier-free guidance, preventing reward hacking and improving semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods often under-optimize or over-optimize (reward hack) rewards, requiring a more stable and effective approach.

Method: Null-TTA optimizes the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance instead of manipulating latent or noise variables.

Result: Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target alignment and maintains strong cross-reward generalization.

Conclusion: Semantic-space optimization via Null-TTA is a principled and effective paradigm for TTA.

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaINeR is a novel Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation combining Gaussian distributions with INR for 2D images, enabling editable, interpretable geometric structure and interactive manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional INRs lack explicit geometric structure and local editing capabilities, limiting their use in dynamic or interactive settings.

Method: GaINeR integrates trainable Gaussian distributions with INR, retrieving K nearest Gaussians per coordinate, aggregating embeddings, and predicting RGB values via a neural network.

Result: The framework offers continuous image representation, interpretable geometry, and flexible local editing for physically aware manipulation.

Conclusion: GaINeR advances INR capabilities by incorporating geometric awareness, making it suitable for interactive and dynamic applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model was developed to enhance low-dose contrast-enhanced MRI images of the cerebellopontine angle cistern, achieving improved image quality and segmentation performance with only 10%-30% of the standard contrast agent dose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to reduce the contrast agent dose in MRI scans for cerebellopontine angle imaging while maintaining diagnostic quality, addressing potential side effects and cost concerns.

Method: Deep learning models were trained to restore standard-dose images from simulated low-dose contrast-enhanced MRI scans. Performance was evaluated using metrics like structural similarity index and segmentation accuracy.

Result: The DL model significantly improved image quality and segmentation metrics, with restored images at 10%-30% standard dose being deemed diagnostically useful.

Conclusion: The DL model successfully enabled high-quality MRI imaging with reduced contrast agent doses, demonstrating clinical feasibility for lesion detection and diagnosis.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

*Gil Goldman,Raja Giryes,Mahadev Satyanarayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a smooth regularization technique inspired by Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) to enhance temporal coherence in lightweight video recognition models, improving accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight video recognition models often struggle with capturing temporal dynamics effectively. The proposed method aims to address this by enforcing smoothness in intermediate-layer embeddings.

Method: The technique models changes in intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames as a GRW, penalizing abrupt shifts and promoting low-acceleration solutions.

Result: The method yields accuracy improvements of 3.8%-6.4% on Kinetics-600, with notable gains for MoViNets and MobileNetV3 models.

Conclusion: The smooth regularization technique effectively enhances temporal coherence in lightweight models, outperforming prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for open vocabulary compositional explanations in AI, addressing limitations of human-annotated datasets by using semantic segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the restriction of relying on human-annotated datasets for understanding neuron activations.

Method: The framework involves specifying concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks, and deriving explanations.

Result: The framework offers improved flexibility and interpretability compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances understanding of neuron activations across arbitrary concepts and datasets.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the UruDendro4 dataset for tree-ring growth analysis, addressing data scarcity by providing annotated cross-sectional images of Pinus taeda L. It also benchmarks automatic ring detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tree-ring measurement is time-consuming and imprecise, highlighting the need for automated solutions. Existing datasets lack volumetric modeling capabilities, which UruDendro4 aims to address.

Method: The UruDendro4 dataset includes 102 annotated images of Pinus taeda L., sampled at multiple stem heights for volumetric modeling. State-of-the-art methods, like DeepCS-TRD, are benchmarked for ring detection.

Result: DeepCS-TRD achieved top performance (mean AP: 0.838, mean AR: 0.782, ARE: 0.084). Training with UruDendro4 improved model generalization in ring detection.

Conclusion: UruDendro4 fills a gap in tree-ring datasets, enabling volumetric modeling and enhancing automated ring detection methods.

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

TL;DR: BUSTR is a multitask vision-language framework generating breast ultrasound reports without paired image-report data, using structured descriptors and radiomics, improving both metrics and clinical efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated radiology report generation lacks paired datasets and faces hallucination risks; BUSTR addresses this by leveraging structured descriptors and avoiding paired supervision.

Method: BUSTR uses a multi-head Swin encoder with multitask loss, combines descriptor-aware visual representations, and aligns visual-textual tokens via dual-level objectives (cross-entropy and cosine-similarity).

Result: BUSTR improves natural language and clinical metrics (e.g., BI-RADS category, pathology) on BrEaST and BUS-BRA datasets without paired data.

Conclusion: BUSTR's descriptor-aware approach and multitask training enhance report generation accuracy and clinical relevance, offering a robust solution without paired supervision.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

*Haoming Lu,David Kocharian,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: motivationmethodresultconclusion


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditionally, image composition focuses on realism and semantic plausibility, but modern content creation often prioritizes artistic, playful, or socially engaging outcomes. This paper introduces the expressive composition task to reflect real-world editing behaviors on creative platforms.

Method: The authors propose StickerNet, a two-stage framework: first classifying composition type, then predicting placement parameters like opacity, mask, location, and scale. The dataset is built from 1.8M editing actions on an anonymous platform, ensuring authentic supervision.

Result: StickerNet outperforms common baselines and aligns closely with human placement behavior, as shown by user studies and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: This work shifts focus from realism to expressiveness and user intent in image composition, demonstrating the value of learning from real-world editing patterns.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

TL;DR: TrafficLens is a proposed algorithm for efficiently analyzing multi-camera traffic feeds by using sequential VLM processing and object-level similarity detection, reducing conversion time by up to 4×.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing and analyzing multi-camera traffic feeds is challenging due to large data volumes and slow text conversion with VLMs, necessitating faster methods for timely insights.

Method: TrafficLens uses sequential VLM processing with overlapping camera coverage and object-level similarity detection to bypass redundant VLM calls.

Result: Experiments show TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to 4× without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: TrafficLens effectively addresses inefficiencies in multi-camera traffic analysis, offering faster and accurate results.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

### [30] [Privacy-Preserving Federated Vision Transformer Learning Leveraging Lightweight Homomorphic Encryption in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20983)
*Al Amin,Kamrul Hasan,Liang Hong,Sharif Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving federated learning framework combines Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) to securely classify histopathology data across institutions, reducing communication costs and preventing model inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning for healthcare, where traditional federated learning remains vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, compromising sensitive medical data.

Method: The framework uses ViT CLS tokens as compact feature representations, encrypting them with CKKS homomorphic encryption before server transmission, significantly reducing communication overhead.

Result: Encrypting CLS tokens reduces communication by 30x and prevents model inversion attacks (high PSNR, SSIM, NMI values). The system achieves 96.12% accuracy unencrypted and 90.02% encrypted.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning for healthcare, offering a secure and efficient solution for multi-institutional collaboration.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

### [31] [Inversion-Free Style Transfer with Dual Rectified Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20986)
*Yingying Deng,Xiangyu He,Fan Tang,Weiming Dong,Xucheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an inversion-free style transfer framework using dual rectified flows, avoiding computational inefficiencies and distortions of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing diffusion-based style transfer methods, which rely on computationally heavy inversion processes and suffer from inefficiency and visual distortions.

Method: The proposed framework uses dual rectified flows to predict content and style trajectories in parallel, fuses them via dynamic midpoint interpolation, and employs attention injection for improved style integration.

Result: The method achieves robust fusion, avoids distortions, and enhances visual fidelity and content preservation, demonstrating generalization across diverse styles and content.

Conclusion: The inversion-free approach provides an efficient and effective pipeline for style transfer, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

*Yu-Huan Wu,Zi-Xuan Zhu,Yan Wang,Liangli Zhen,Deng-Ping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Ref-COD framework that eliminates the need for reference images at test time by distilling references into a class-prototype memory and synthesizing reference vectors via query-conditioned prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-COD systems rely on dual-branch designs requiring reference images at test time, which limits deployability, increases latency, and adds data-collection burden.

Method: The proposed framework uses EMA-updated class prototypes and a query-conditioned mixture to synthesize reference vectors. It also includes a bidirectional attention alignment module to bridge representation gaps.

Result: The method achieves competitive or superior performance on the R2C7K benchmark without requiring test-time references.

Conclusion: The presented approach provides a simpler, more efficient solution for Ref-COD, eliminating the dependency on reference images during inference.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

TL;DR: WavePCNet is a physics-driven network for localizing and segmenting obscured objects using wavefront propagation, addressing challenges like noise and perturbations with innovative modules like TriWCP and high-frequency compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture coherent light propagation physics and perform poorly under low signal-to-noise conditions, leading to non-physical solutions and unreliable observations.

Method: WavePCNet uses Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) for precise wavefront modeling, momentum memory for perturbation suppression, and high-frequency cross-layer compensation for robustness.

Result: WavePCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across four physically collected datasets.

Conclusion: WavePCNet effectively enhances obscured object perception by integrating physics-driven constraints and compensation mechanisms, offering superior performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GuardTrace-VL is introduced as a vision-aware safety auditor that detects unsafe content in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) during the reasoning process, improving safety detection by 13.5% F1 score over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal safety guards fail to monitor intermediate reasoning traces, allowing unsafe content like biases or policy violations to go undetected.

Method: GuardTrace-VL employs joint image-text analysis to monitor the QTA pipeline. It uses a constructed dataset (GuardTrace) and a three-stage progressive training scheme.

Result: The model achieves a 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection, outperforming previous methods by 13.5%.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL effectively addresses the gap in multimodal safety by detecting unsafe content during reasoning, supported by robust training and evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for image layer decomposition, introducing a multi-modal context fusion module for detail preservation. It achieves strong results in object removal and occlusion recovery using synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for decomposing images into layers (foreground/background) are limited, hindering independent editing flexibility. The paper leverages the connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks to address this gap.

Method: The authors adapt a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition with lightweight finetuning. They introduce a multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity to preserve latent space detail. Training uses synthetic data from open-source assets.

Result: The model excels in object removal and occlusion recovery, demonstrating superior performance and enabling downstream editing applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances layer decomposition, unlocking new creative possibilities for image editing and content creation.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MERGE, a multimodal entity-aware retrieval-augmented framework, addresses challenges in news image captioning by enhancing information coverage, cross-modal alignment, and visual-entity grounding, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve news image captioning by tackling incomplete information coverage, weak cross-modal alignment, and suboptimal visual-entity grounding, which limit current methods' effectiveness.

Method: MERGE introduces an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) for enriched background retrieval, uses a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy for better alignment, and employs dynamic retrieval guided by image content for improved visual-entity matching.

Result: MERGE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on GoodNews and NYTimes800k datasets, with significant improvements in CIDEr scores (+6.84, +1.16) and F1-scores (+4.14, +2.64). It also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset (+20.17 CIDEr, +6.22 F1).

Conclusion: MERGE demonstrates robust performance and domain adaptability, effectively addressing key challenges in news image captioning.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

### [37] [MetaRank: Task-Aware Metric Selection for Model Transferability Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21007)
*Yuhang Liu,Wenjie Zhao,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaRank is a meta-learning framework that automatically selects the best Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) metric for transfer learning tasks by learning relationships between dataset descriptions and metric performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective transfer learning depends on choosing the right pre-trained model, but current MTE metric selection is ad hoc or based on average performance, which is suboptimal due to task-dependent variations.

Method: MetaRank uses a pretrained language model to encode dataset and metric descriptions into a shared semantic space, training a meta-predictor offline with a listwise ranking objective to learn optimal metric selections.

Result: Experiments across 11 models and 11 datasets show MetaRank's effectiveness in ranking MTE metrics accurately for unseen tasks.

Conclusion: MetaRank provides a task-aware, automated solution for MTE metric selection, improving transfer learning efficiency without full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

*Haojian Huang,Jiahao Shi,Zhe Liu,Harold Haodong Chen,Han Fang,Hao Sun,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel TMVC framework using prototypes simplifies neighbor relations and aligns structures dynamically, improving efficiency and consistency in multi-view classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TMVC methods face high computational costs and inconsistent inter-view relationships due to reliance on globally dense neighbor structures and manual weight assignment.

Method: Introduces prototypes to represent neighbor structures per view, simplifying intra-view relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structures.

Result: Outperforms prevalent TMVC methods in downstream performance and robustness across multiple public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances trustworthiness in multi-view classification by efficiently discovering cross-view consensus.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster is a unified framework for image retouching that decouples camera directives and integrates them with precise parameter control, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on ambiguous text prompts or separate parameter adjustments, limiting scalability and precision in camera control.

Method: CameraMaster decouples camera directives, integrates them with parameter embeddings, and modulates content features via cross-attention for precise control.

Result: CameraMaster achieves monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports multi-parameter composition, and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: CameraMaster provides a scalable and precise solution for physically consistent image retouching with unified parameter control.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: CaptionQA is a utility-based benchmark evaluating if captions can replace images in downstream tasks, covering 4 domains with 33,027 annotated questions. It reveals gaps between image and caption utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices overlook whether captions can effectively substitute images in real-world tasks.

Method: CaptionQA uses densely annotated multiple-choice questions requiring visual info, answered by an LLM using captions to measure utility.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs show up to 32% drop in caption utility compared to image utility.

Conclusion: CaptionQA highlights significant utility gaps between images and captions, providing a tool for future extensions.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

TL;DR: Music-to-dance generation improved via FlowerDance for efficient, high-quality motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack efficiency for high-fidelity 3D rendering, limiting expressiveness in real-world applications.

Method: Combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints and uses a BiMamba-based backbone with Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion for non-autoregressive generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art motion quality and efficiency on AIST++ and FineDance datasets.

Conclusion: FlowerDance outperforms existing methods in efficiency and motion quality, supporting interactive motion editing.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: LungNoduleAgent is a collaborative multi-agent system designed to improve lung CT scan analysis by breaking down the diagnostic process into sequential components, enhancing nodule description and malignancy grading. It outperforms existing models and highlights the value of multi-agent collaboration and region-level semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with accurately describing lung nodule morphology and integrating medical expertise, limiting their clinical reliability. Collaborative multi-agent systems could bridge this gap by balancing generality and precision.

Method: LungNoduleAgent uses three modules: Nodule Spotter for nodule detection, Radiologist for CT report generation, and Doctor Agent System for malignancy reasoning. It leverages a pathology knowledge base and multi-agent collaboration.

Result: Extensive testing on private and public datasets (LIDC-IDRI) showed LungNoduleAgent outperforms mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and expert models.

Conclusion: LungNoduleAgent demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-agent collaboration and region-level semantic alignment in lung nodule diagnosis, positioning it as a promising clinical tool.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combines generative models with dense physical constraints for spatially varying image deblurring, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current learning-based approaches—over-smoothed results from model-based methods and hallucinated details from generative models—by integrating strong physical constraints with generative priors.

Method: Proposes a framework that models degradation as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, conditioning a ControlNet architecture to guide diffusion sampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art model-based and generative methods in handling severe blurring, achieving better physical accuracy and perceptual realism.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the gap between physical constraints and generative priors, offering superior performance in complex deblurring scenarios.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Conclusion: MUSE establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis by unifying generation and editing tasks effectively.

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

### [45] [Long-Term Alzheimers Disease Prediction: A Novel Image Generation Method Using Temporal Parameter Estimation with Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution on Uneven Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21057)
*Xin Hong,Xinze Sun,Yinhao Li,Yen-Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the T-NIG model to improve long-term AD prediction by handling irregular time intervals in sequential imaging data, maintaining disease-related characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in maintaining disease-related characteristics in AD predictions due to irregular time intervals in sequential data.

Method: The T-NIG model uses Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution with temporal parameters to generate intermediate and future brain images, leveraging coordinate neighborhoods and uncertainty estimation.

Result: T-NIG achieves state-of-the-art performance in short- and long-term prediction tasks, effectively forecasting disease progression despite irregular temporal data.

Conclusion: T-NIG successfully maintains disease-related characteristics in AD predictions, demonstrating robustness against irregular time intervals.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

*Ziyun Zeng,Hang Hua,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRA, a lightweight multimodal reasoning agent, improves instruction-guided image editing by iteratively predicting atomic edits using visual feedback, outperforming proprietary systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based editing models struggle with complex instructions, leading to semantic drift or inaccurate edits. MIRA aims to address this by simulating human-model interaction processes.

Method: MIRA uses an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop and a two-stage training pipeline (SFT + GRPO) with the MIRA-Editing dataset to predict atomic edit instructions step by step.

Result: When paired with open-source editing models, MIRA significantly enhances semantic consistency and perceptual quality, matching or surpassing proprietary systems like GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Conclusion: MIRA demonstrates effective multimodal reasoning for complex image editing tasks, offering a plug-and-play solution that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel iris authentication pipeline using 3D-CNN captures spatio-temporal cues, trained with triplet and ArcFace loss, enhancing robustness against common challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iris authentication methods struggle with rotation, scale, reflections, blur, and simplistic comparisons, lacking effective spatio-temporal modeling.

Method: Splits iris images into sub-image sequences, processes via 3D-CNN, and trains with curriculum learning using triplet and ArcFace loss.

Result: Achieves robust and generalizable iris recognition by embedding temporal dependencies into discriminative feature spaces.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline outperforms traditional methods by leveraging spatio-temporal dynamics, offering a resilient solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

*Gayoung Lee,Junho Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a framework for 3D reconstruction of reflective objects by translating them into clay-like forms to handle reflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflective objects pose challenges in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under reflections.

Method: The framework uses a dual-branch network: one branch handles BRDF-based reflections, while the other stabilizes geometry using clay-like images. Both branches are trained jointly.

Result: Experiments show improved normal accuracy and mesh completeness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Translating radiance into neutrality (clay-like forms) is an effective inductive bias for learning reflective object geometry.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadarFM introduces a radar foundation model using structured spatial language supervision to unify scene-level representations, addressing fragmentation in existing radar approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radar methods are task-specific, lacking transferability. Recent advances in foundation models for vision and language inspire their integration with radar sensing.

Method: RadarFM uses structured captions to encode vehicle distributions in radar coordinates and employs hash-aware contrastive learning for fine-grained spatial reasoning. Large-scale datasets are generated via CARLA simulator.

Result: The model achieves unified representations and introduces localization-aware metrics for spatial accuracy.

Conclusion: RadarFM bridges gaps in radar sensing by leveraging foundation models, enabling transferable representations and improved spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

*Ze Feng,Sen Yang,Boqiang Duan,Wankou Yang,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EM-KD enhances Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by addressing unbalanced vision tokens via Manhattan distance and Hungarian matching, followed by Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD), outperforming prior methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficient MLLMs lose fine-grained visual comprehension due to compressed vision tokens, and prior Knowledge Distillation methods fail to address the imbalance between student and teacher models.

Method: EM-KD uses Manhattan distance and Hungarian matching to align vision tokens, then applies VLAD (minimizing smooth L1 distance of affinity matrices) and VSD (using reverse KL divergence for semantic distillation).

Result: EM-KD-trained models outperform prior Efficient MLLMs significantly in accuracy and efficiency, even when compared fairly with previous distillation methods.

Conclusion: EM-KD effectively addresses unbalanced vision tokens and enhances comprehension, making it a superior approach for efficient MLLMs.

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

TL;DR: FaithFusion combines 3DGS and diffusion models using Expected Information Gain for coherent 3D scene reconstruction and synthesis, achieving SOTA results on Waymo dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maintain geometric fidelity and visual plausibility under large viewpoint shifts in driving-scene reconstruction.

Method: Uses Expected Information Gain (EIG) to guide diffusion models and distill edits back into 3DGS, without extra prior conditions.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on Waymo dataset (FID of 107.47 at 6 meters lane shift).

Conclusion: FaithFusion effectively addresses challenges in geometric fidelity and appearance synthesis.

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DATGN for automating morphological change learning in brain images to predict Alzheimer's disease early, improving classification accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can slow progression, but current methods rely on manual feature extraction of brain images.

Method: DATGN interpolates missing MRI data and uses a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module to generate future MRI images adhering to AD progression.

Result: DATGN showed competitive PSNR and MMSE metrics. Integration into classification methods improved AD vs. NC accuracy by 6.21-16% and AD vs. MCI vs. NC by 7.34-21.25%.

Conclusion: DATGN effectively predicts AD early by generating realistic MRI images aligned with brain atrophy trends.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntPruner is an entropy-guided pruning framework for diffusion and flow models, reducing parameter redundancy while preserving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision generative models often suffer from parameter redundancy when transferred to downstream tasks, needing efficient pruning methods.

Method: Introduces entropy-guided pruning with Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) for importance assessment and a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework.

Result: Achieves up to 2.22× inference speedup on DiT and SiT models while maintaining generation quality on ImageNet and downstream datasets.

Conclusion: EntPruner effectively balances efficiency and performance in pruning generative models.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff is a unified diffusion model leveraging multi-modal cues (depth, normals, segmentation, etc.) to enhance video understanding and controllable generation, addressing challenges like temporal drift and missing inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometry-only cues in video understanding and generation often under-constrain appearance and physics-based edits (e.g., relighting). Integrating additional graphics-based modalities disambiguates understanding and enables precise control.

Method: Proposes CtrlVDiff, a diffusion model trained with Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS), fusing features from diverse modalities (depth, normals, intrinsics, etc.). Uses MMVideo dataset, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset with aligned modalities and captions.

Result: CtrlVDiff achieves superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material swaps) and outperforming baselines while remaining robust to missing modalities.

Conclusion: Enriching video models with multi-modal cues enhances both understanding and generation, enabling precise edits and temporal coherence.

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchorOPT introduces dynamic anchors in prompt learning, improving flexibility and performance over static methods, with seamless integration into existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static anchors in prompt learning lack adaptability across tasks and stages, limiting CLIP generalizations.

Method: AnchorOPT learns dynamic anchor values and optimizes their positional relationships via a learnable matrix, trained in two stages.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to methods with extra modules or regularization, with consistent gains across datasets.

Conclusion: AnchorOPT effectively addresses the limitations of static anchors, offering a flexible and high-performing solution.

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) for kernel-level blur understanding in image deblurring, improving performance by converting spatial convolution to Fourier multiplication and leveraging feature-based convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep networks fail to understand the blur process at the kernel level, limiting deblurring performance. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces FKE for kernel-level learning in Fourier space, uses feature-based convolution, and employs a decoupled multi-scale architecture with reversible sub-unets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and demonstrates potential for solving other kernel-related problems.

Conclusion: FKE enables effective kernel-level blur understanding with low complexity and no additional supervision, advancing deblurring performance.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Conclusion: Ent-Prog effectively addresses efficiency challenges in training diffusion models for human video generation, offering significant speed and memory improvements.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how visual distractors impact vision-language models (VLMs) during testing, revealing differences from textual distractors, and proposes solutions to mitigate bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work showed textual distractors cause inverse scaling in language models, but multimodal settings were unexplored. The study aims to understand if VLMs exhibit similar effects with visual distractors.

Method: The authors created Idis, a visual QA dataset with varied distractors (semantic, numerical, spatial) and analyzed reasoning length and accuracy. They also tracked attribute counts in reasoning traces and tested prompting strategies.

Result: Visual distractors reduce accuracy without increasing reasoning length, unlike textual ones. Attribute tracking provided insights, and a prompting method helped mitigate bias-driven predictions.

Conclusion: Visual distractors uniquely affect VLMs, offering practical insights for model improvement and bias mitigation.

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

TL;DR: TEAR is a temporal-aware framework designed to uncover safety risks in Text-to-Video (T2V) models by crafting adversarial prompts that exploit temporal dynamics, achieving an 80% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation methods for static images and texts are inadequate for capturing the complex temporal dynamics in video generation, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: TEAR uses a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage process (initial training and online preference learning) and refines prompts cyclically for stealth and effectiveness.

Result: TEAR achieves an 80% attack success rate on T2V models, significantly outperforming previous methods (57%).

Conclusion: TEAR effectively addresses the safety challenges posed by dynamic video generation, demonstrating superior performance in uncovering risks.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

TL;DR: LLaVA-UHD v3 introduces Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) to enable efficient native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between global native-resolution visual encoding's enhanced capability and its computational cost.

Method: Proposes PVC with refined patch embedding and windowed token compression to hierarchically aggregate tokens.

Result: ViT-UHD reduces TTFT by 2.4x compared to MoonViT; LLaVA-UHD v3 reduces TTFT by 1.9x versus Qwen2-VL.

Conclusion: PVC efficiently reconfigures ViT for MLLMs, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

*Joonhyung Park,Hyeongwon Jang,Joowon Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridAR introduces a test-time scaling framework for visual autoregressive models, improving text-to-image generation by pruning erroneous trajectories early and guiding decoding with layout-specified prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of naive test-time scaling strategies like Best-of-N in visual autoregressive models, which lack a canvas blueprint and waste computation on errors.

Method: GridAR uses grid-partitioned progressive generation, pruning infeasible candidates early and anchoring viable ones, alongside layout-specified prompt reformulation.

Result: GridAR outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ with N=4 and reduces cost by 25.6%. It also excels in image editing.

Conclusion: GridAR effectively enhances test-time scaling for visual AR models, improving quality and efficiency in text-to-image generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tokenizing 3D scenes holistically and leveraging these tokens for diverse understanding tasks.

Method: A three-stage tokenization pipeline using Multi-Scale NDT representation and a decoder (MSDec) for feature fusion and task unification.

Result: NDTokenizer3D achieves significant improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Conclusion: The compact and unified design of NDTokenizer3D provides a general-purpose solution for fine-grained 3D vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UPA-RFAS is a universal, transferable adversarial patch framework targeting VLA-driven robots, combining feature-space objectives, robustness-augmented min-max procedures, and VLA-specific losses to achieve cross-model transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing patches often overfit to specific models and fail in black-box settings. This paper aims to address this gap by developing universal, transferable adversarial patches.

Method: The paper introduces UPA-RFAS, a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space. It combines a feature-space objective with an ℓ₁ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss, a robustness-augmented min-max procedure, and two VLA-specific losses (Patch Attention Dominance and Patch Semantic Misalignment).

Result: Experiments demonstrate that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across diverse VLA models, tasks, and viewpoints, proving its effectiveness in black-box settings and sim-to-real shifts.

Conclusion: UPA-RFAS exposes a practical patch-based attack surface for VLA-driven robots and sets a strong baseline for future defenses against such adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

*Hanyang Li,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCBoost is a plug-in enhancement for deep clustering models, leveraging reliable local features to improve global feature structures and clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The disparity between global and local feature structures in existing deep clustering models motivates the development of DCBoost to address intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters.

Method: DCBoost uses adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors filtering to identify high-confidence samples for self-supervision, then applies a discriminative loss to optimize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: DCBoost boosts clustering performance by over 3% on state-of-the-art baselines and enhances the silhouette coefficient by more than $7\times$.

Conclusion: DCBoost effectively enhances global feature structures in deep clustering models, significantly improving clustering performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BotaCLIP is a lightweight multimodal framework adapting a pre-trained Earth Observation model to inject ecological knowledge without heavy retraining, showing improved performance in biodiversity tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to adapt pre-trained foundation models with domain-specific knowledge efficiently, avoiding costly retraining, especially for ecological applications.

Method: BotaCLIP uses multimodal contrastive learning to align aerial imagery with botanical data, incorporating regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: BotaCLIP outperformed the original foundation model and supervised baselines in plant presence, butterfly occurrence, and soil abundance tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can effectively inject expert knowledge into data-scarce domains, enabling efficient representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

*Baoli Sun,Yihan Wang,Xinzhu Ma,Zhihui Wang,Kun Lu,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework for fine-grained action recognition, leveraging a query-response mechanism and semantic activation to track subtle local details, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with identifying subtle details in fine-grained action recognition, prompting the need for a solution that captures and tracks distinctive local dynamics.

Method: Proposes ART with a region-specific semantic activation module, action tracklets for dynamics, and multi-level contrastive constraints, optimized using VLMs and fine-tuning.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on action recognition benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The ART framework effectively addresses the challenges of fine-grained action recognition by leveraging semantic queries and dynamic tracking, achieving notable improvements.

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow for generative modeling, showing CFM's superior performance over DDPM and MeanFlow's efficiency in one-step sampling. It also highlights CFM's effectiveness in image inpainting with significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance and efficiency of DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow in generative tasks, and explore CFM's potential for image inpainting.

Method: Implemented all three models (DDPM, CFM, MeanFlow) using TinyUNet on CIFAR-10, and extended CFM with mask-guided sampling for inpainting.

Result: CFM outperformed DDPM (FID 24.15 vs. 402.98), while MeanFlow achieved FID 29.15 with single-step sampling. Inpainting saw PSNR and SSIM improvements of 73% and 45%, respectively.

Conclusion: CFM is superior for iterative tasks, MeanFlow excels in efficiency, and CFM-based inpainting shows significant quality improvements.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

TL;DR: FIELDS is a novel method for 3D face reconstruction that captures subtle emotional details by combining 2D supervision with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an emotion recognition branch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth.

Method: FIELDS extends self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch, guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans.

Result: The method yields high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues, improving facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Conclusion: FIELDS bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, producing emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions from a single image.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional convolutional neural networks lack shift equivariance and invariance due to downsampling/upsampling operations. The study aims to address this gap theoretically and systematically.

Method: Extends LPS to complex-valued networks, adding a projection layer from ℂ to ℝ before Gumbel Softmax. Evaluated on classification, reconstruction, and semantic segmentation tasks using polarimetric SAR images.

Result: The proposed extension theoretically guarantees shift equivariance and invariance, with empirical validation across specified tasks.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends LPS to complex-valued networks, achieving the desired properties and demonstrating effectiveness in practical applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, failing to address the diversity and complexity of real-world AV forgery scenarios.

Method: A multi-stage hybrid forgery framework integrates proprietary models for task planning and expert generative models for precise manipulation, creating AVFakeBench with 12K audio-video questions across seven forgery types and four annotation levels.

Result: Evaluation of 11 AV-LMMs and 2 detection methods on AVFakeBench shows AV-LMMs' potential as forgery detectors but highlights weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: AVFakeBench provides a robust framework for advancing AV forgery detection, revealing both strengths and areas needing improvement in current AV-LMMs.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

TL;DR: LaGen is the first framework for autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes, addressing limitations in existing LiDAR generation and prediction methods by enabling interactive, frame-by-frame synthesis with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR generation methods lack interactivity and long-horizon capabilities, limiting their utility for autonomous driving applications.

Method: LaGen introduces a framework for autoregressive LiDAR scene generation, incorporating bounding box conditions, a scene decoupling module, and noise modulation to enhance fidelity and reduce error accumulation.

Result: LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art models in generating high-fidelity 4D LiDAR scenes, particularly excelling in long-horizon generation.

Conclusion: LaGen advances LiDAR scene generation by enabling interactive, long-horizon synthesis, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

TL;DR: MatchGS leverages refined 3DGS geometry for robust, zero-shot image matching by correcting its geometric inaccuracies and aligning 2D-3D representations, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of 3DGS in geometric accuracy and depth rendering for robust correspondence labeling, enabling scalable and high-fidelity training data for image matching.

Method: Introduces a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline and a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy to refine 3DGS geometry and guide 2D matchers.

Result: Reduces epipolar error by up to 40x, improves supervision for extreme viewpoints, and boosts state-of-the-art matchers' zero-shot performance by up to 17.7%.

Conclusion: Properly refined 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity data source for robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Motivation: To create a unified model for remote sensing tasks leveraging multi-task learning and vision-language models, improving generalization and scalability.

Method: Proposes RSCoVLM with a data curation engine, unified dynamic-resolution strategy, Zoom-in Chain for UHR images, and enhanced object detection.

Result: RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, surpassing existing vision-language models and competing with specialized models.

Conclusion: The model and tools are open-sourced to advance general-purpose remote sensing models, demonstrating flexibility and effectiveness.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

*Jules Decaestecker,Nicolas Vigne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathMamba combines Mamba's linear-time efficiency with Vision Transformers' global reasoning for superior road segmentation, improving topological continuity and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of Vision Transformers in road segmentation and leverage Mamba's linear-time efficiency for modeling continuous road structures.

Method: Introduces PathMamba, a hybrid architecture using Mamba blocks for sequential road modeling and Transformer blocks for global context refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets, with notable improvements in topological continuity (APLS metric).

Conclusion: PathMamba efficiently balances accuracy and topological continuity, setting a new benchmark for road segmentation.

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaliTex addresses cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation using geometry-calibrated attention modules, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation systems suffer from cross-view inconsistency due to unstructured full attention causing geometric confusion.

Method: Introduces CaliTex with Part-Aligned Attention and Condition-Routed Attention modules, coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer.

Result: Produces seamless, view-consistent textures and surpasses open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: CaliTex ensures geometric coherence inherently, improving texture generation.

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

### [76] [HTTM: Head-wise Temporal Token Merging for Faster VGGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21317)
*Weitian Wang,Lukas Meiner,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT advances 3D scene reconstruction by jointly inferring key 3D attributes but faces latency issues with large scenes. HTTM, a training-free method, accelerates VGGT by merging tokens per attention head, preserving uniqueness and achieving up to 7x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token merging techniques hinder VGGT's performance by creating identical tokens. HTTM aims to preserve token uniqueness and leverage spatial-temporal correspondence for efficient merging.

Method: HTTM merges tokens at multi-head granularity instead of uniformly, maintaining uniqueness after head concatenation and using spatial locality and temporal correspondence for higher merging ratios.

Result: HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration in GPU-based inference with negligible performance drops compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HTTM effectively addresses VGGT's latency bottleneck by improving token merging techniques, enabling faster inference without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConFu is a multimodal framework that jointly embeds individual and fused modalities into a unified space, capturing higher-order dependencies while preserving pairwise relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal methods often focus on pairwise alignment or overlook pairwise relationships when capturing higher-order interactions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ConFu introduces a fused-modality contrastive term alongside traditional pairwise contrastive objectives to align modalities and their combinations in a unified space.

Result: ConFu performs competitively on retrieval and classification tasks, capturing higher-order dependencies and scaling with multimodal complexity.

Conclusion: ConFu effectively balances higher-order dependency capture with pairwise relationship preservation, offering versatile retrieval and classification performance.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable low-latency, real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure while preserving spatial feature grounding and enhancing interpretability.

Method: Integrates SIFT for spatial feature encoding, a latency-driven spike conversion layer, and LIF SNN for classification, tested on Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset.

Result: Achieves 92.3% accuracy, 9.5 ms per-frame inference time, and 8.1% sparse spike activity, suitable for low-power edge deployment.

Conclusion: The SIFT-SNN framework is effective for real-time anomaly detection and interpretable decision-making, though generalization to unseen conditions requires further validation.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical datasets lack consistency and pixel-level segmentation, hindering evaluation and applicability of multimodal LLMs in surgery.

Method: Introduces SurgMLLMBench with the MAVIS dataset, combining pixel-level segmentation and VQA annotations under a unified taxonomy for laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains.

Result: A single model trained on SurgMLLMBench performs consistently across domains and generalizes to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: SurgMLLMBench advances surgical AI research by enabling reproducible evaluation and development of interactive multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

*Qing Li,Huifang Feng,Kanle Shi,Yue Gao,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-scale feature fusion method for robust normal estimation in point clouds, addressing challenges in selecting patch sizes and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurately predicting normals for diverse point clouds due to difficulties in selecting appropriate neighborhood sizes and parameter-heavy strategies.

Method: Introduces a patch feature fitting (PFF) approach using multi-scale feature fusion, with aggregation and compensation modules to adaptively capture geometric details across scales.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer parameters and reduced running time.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-scale feature fusion strategy effectively addresses the challenge of patch size selection and improves normal estimation accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endo-G$^{2}$T introduces a geometry-guided, temporally aware training scheme for 4D Gaussian splatting to address view-dependent effects in endoscopic videos, improving monocular reconstruction accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic videos suffer from view-dependent effects like specularities and occlusions, causing geometric drift in photometric supervision. The paper aims to anchor geometry early while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency.

Method: The method includes geo-guided prior distillation with scale-invariant losses, a time-embedded Gaussian field for dynamics, and keyframe-constrained streaming for efficiency and stability.

Result: Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets for monocular reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively addresses geometric drift and temporal inconsistency in endoscopic scenes, offering superior performance in dynamic 4DGS.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: STVG-o1 is a new framework enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to excel in spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) without architectural changes, using a bounding-box chain-of-thought and reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underperformance of MLLMs in STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak region-word alignment.

Method: Introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism and a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function for geometry-aware supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, surpassing task-specific methods and existing MLLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: Demonstrates MLLMs as powerful backbones for precise STVG, with strong generalization and no model modifications required.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

TL;DR: Monet is a training framework enabling MLLMs to reason directly in latent visual space using continuous embeddings, addressing computational and supervision challenges. VLPO enhances latent reasoning, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack human-like abstract visual thinking due to reliance on external tools. Monet aims to overcome this by reasoning within latent visual space.

Method: Monet employs a three-stage distillation-based SFT pipeline and introduces VLPO for reinforcement learning, using the Monet-SFT-125K dataset.

Result: Monet-7B shows consistent gains in perception and reasoning benchmarks, with strong generalization on abstract tasks.

Conclusion: Monet advances latent visual reasoning, with insights from component analysis and early attempts guiding future developments.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

TL;DR: DiverseVAR improves diversity in text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) without retraining, using noise injection and scale-travel refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models lack diversity in generated images despite high quality, a largely overlooked issue.

Method: Inject noise into text embeddings for diversity and use scale-travel refinement to maintain image quality.

Result: Combined approach enhances diversity while minimizing quality loss, setting a new Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR effectively balances diversity and quality trade-offs in VAR models.

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for remote sensing change captioning using SAM for region-level representations and a knowledge graph, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack strong region awareness and temporal alignment in describing changes between remote sensing images.

Method: Combines CNN/Transformer for global features, SAM for semantic/motion regions, and a knowledge graph, fused via cross-attention for captioning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances region awareness and temporal alignment in change captioning.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAM_ChangeCaptioning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-M3RF is an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that combines geometric and color features to improve reassembly accuracy, especially in ambiguous cases, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based 3D reassembly methods rely heavily on geometric features, leading to challenges with ambiguous or insufficient geometry (e.g., small, eroded, or symmetric fragments) and lack of physical constraints to prevent overlaps.

Method: E-M3RF uses SE(3) flow matching to predict transformations for reassembly. It encodes 3D point positions as rotation-consistent geometric features with a rotation-equivariant encoder and colors with a transformer, combining them into a multimodal representation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic (Breaking Bad, Fantastic Breaks) and real-world (RePAIR, Presious) datasets show E-M3RF reduces rotation error by 23.1%, translation error by 13.2%, and Chamfer Distance by 18.4% compared to competitors.

Conclusion: E-M3RF leverages multimodal features to address geometric ambiguity and improve reassembly accuracy, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods.

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Result: Effective segmentation of human tasks on benchmarks and proprietary datasets, with confirmed semantic coherence via clustering and Vision-Language Model assessment.

Conclusion: The first fully automated system for extracting VLA pre-training data from industrial videos, enabling scalable embodied AI applications.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism to address undersampling in event cameras by connecting event tokens and leveraging contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras' spatial sparsity leads to undersampling. Existing methods (event frames, voxels, tensors) struggle with this issue.

Method: Hypergraph-guided completion connects event tokens across time and space, incorporates RGB tokens, and uses self-attention for fusion.

Result: Experiments on event classification tasks confirm the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses spatial sparsity and enables multi-modal feature fusion.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational complexity and slow speed of diffusion models hinder real-time high-resolution video generation on mobile devices.

Method: Proposes MobileI2V with a hybrid linear-softmax attention denoiser, time-step distillation reducing sampling steps, and mobile-specific attention optimizations.

Result: Achieves 720p video generation under 100 ms per frame with quality comparable to existing models.

Conclusion: MobileI2V addresses mobile-specific challenges, offering fast, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the quadratic computational complexity issue in Vision Transformers while addressing overlooked frequency characteristics like rank collapsing and over-smoothing.

Result: Results show improved accuracy, reduced computational overhead, and mitigation of rank collapsing and over-smoothing compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of the frequency-aware token reduction strategy in enhancing Vision Transformer performance and efficiency, while also analyzing prior methods' limitations.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

*Taehoon Kim,Donghwan Jang,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Merge-and-Bound (M&B) is a novel Class Incremental Learning (CIL) method that optimizes model weights via inter-task and intra-task merging, minimizing catastrophic forgetting without altering model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in CIL by proposing a weight-merging approach that preserves previous knowledge while learning new tasks.

Method: M&B involves inter-task (averaging weights across stages) and intra-task (combining parameters within stages) merging, plus bounded updates to minimize cumulative changes.

Result: M&B outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard CIL benchmarks, reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: M&B provides an effective, architecture-agnostic solution for CIL by optimizing weight merging and bounded updates.

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-attention-based distillation methods independently align teacher and student feature maps, lacking thorough pixel-wise relationship capture.

Method: CanKD leverages cross-attention mechanisms to dynamically consider all teacher feature map pixels for each student pixel, introducing only an additional loss function.

Result: CanKD achieves superior performance in object detection and image segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods.

Conclusion: CanKD presents a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks, with practical benefits demonstrated in extensive experiments.

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Motivation: To fairly compare deepfake detectors and identify factors that genuinely enhance performance.

Method: Systematic investigation of design choices in training, inference, and updates.

Result: Identified design choices boost detection accuracy and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Establishing robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for future deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework automates ANA detection using MIML learning, improving accuracy and efficiency without manual preprocessing, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ANA detection is slow and labor-intensive; existing automation methods struggle with MIML complexities in real-world clinical settings.

Method: Proposes a framework with three components: instance sampler, probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients.

Result: Achieves +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains on ANA dataset; top-2 performance on public datasets with reduced Hamming loss and one-error.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles MIML challenges, supports end-to-end optimization, and sets new state-of-the-art results for ANA detection.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models in Earth Observation rely on massive computational resources and datasets, which are unsustainable and limit accessibility. The authors aim to provide a more efficient, scalable, and environmentally responsible alternative.

Method: The method involves decomposing the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused, supporting modularity, federated training, pruning, and continuous integration.

Result: The framework offers advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility, making it suitable for collaborative and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: The Ensemble-of-Specialists approach introduces a scalable and efficient direction for building RSFMs, addressing sustainability and accessibility challenges.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely Alzheimer's identification is crucial for personalized treatment, but irregular input sequences challenge accurate image-based prediction.

Method: Sequential image generation guided by quantitative metrics and integrating an age-scaling factor for MRI synthesis.

Result: Quantitative metrics improved MRI synthesis accuracy; age-scaled pixel loss enhanced iterative generation; Structural Similarity Index peaked at 0.882.

Conclusion: The methodology enhances MRI image synthesis for Alzheimer's prediction, supporting better long-term disease prognosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

TL;DR: PRFL is a latent-space framework for video reward feedback learning, improving alignment with human preferences while reducing memory and training time compared to pixel-space methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reward models are limited by pixel-space inputs, leading to inefficiencies and lack of early-stage supervision for motion dynamics and structural coherence.

Method: PRFL leverages pre-trained video models for reward modeling in noisy latent space, enabling full-chain gradient backpropagation without VAE decoding.

Result: PRFL outperforms RGB ReFL in alignment with human preferences, with significant reductions in memory use and training time.

Conclusion: PRFL offers a more efficient and effective approach for aligning video generation with human preferences by optimizing in latent space.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAVLight is introduced as a benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction, addressing challenges caused by lighting variations in multi-view reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illumination inconsistency disrupts multi-view 3D reconstruction due to varying sunlight, clouds, and shadows, leading to artifacts like geometry drift and shadow imprinting. Current datasets lack controlled yet realistic lighting diversity.

Method: UAVLight captures scenes along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, ensuring consistent geometry and viewpoints while introducing natural lighting variation.

Result: The benchmark provides standardized evaluation protocols, enabling reliable development and testing of reconstruction methods for outdoor environments with varying lighting.

Conclusion: UAVLight offers a controlled-yet-real dataset to study and improve illumination robustness in 3D reconstruction, addressing limitations of existing datasets.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

TL;DR: MRPD is a teacher-student framework using multimodal prompts to robustly distill 3D point cloud models, outperforming existing defenses with no extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks threaten 3D point cloud models, with current defenses being computationally heavy and lacking generalization.

Method: MRPD aligns student features with robust embeddings from three teachers (vision, 3D, text) via confidence-gated distillation during training.

Result: MRPD excels against diverse attacks and improves clean data performance, surpassing state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: MRPD offers a practical, efficient paradigm for robust 3D vision by leveraging multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework combining 2D/3D landmark registration with U-Net training to improve pelvic landmark detection accuracy under variable intra-operative conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pelvic landmark detection methods assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view, which doesn't account for deviations in orientation during surgery.

Method: The framework integrates 2D/3D landmark registration into U-Net training, comparing variants like Pose Estimation Loss and fine-tuning under variable pose conditions.

Result: Performance is evaluated by comparing accuracy between baseline U-Net, U-Net with Pose Estimation Loss, and fine-tuned U-Net under realistic intra-operative scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the limitation of fixed-view assumptions and improves landmark detection accuracy in variable patient poses.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

TL;DR: Harmony is a novel framework addressing audio-visual synchronization challenges in generative AI through Cross-Task Synergy training, a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module, and SyncCFG, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source models struggle with robust audio-video alignment due to Correspondence Drift, inefficient global attention, and intra-modal bias in CFG.

Method: Harmony employs Cross-Task Synergy training, a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module, and Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) to enforce synchronization.

Result: Harmony outperforms existing methods in generation fidelity and fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: Harmony sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively addressing synchronization challenges in audio-visual content synthesis.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Motivation: Oral cancer is often diagnosed late due to visual similarities between benign and malignant lesions. Early computer-aided diagnosis can improve outcomes.

Method: Combines stratified data splitting, advanced data augmentation, and oversampling to classify 16 oral lesions using deep learning.

Result: Achieved 83.33% accuracy, 89.12% precision, and 77.31% recall, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for early oral cancer detection, emphasizing the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

TL;DR: The paper argues that current LLM efficiency methods are impractical for most organizations due to high overhead and proposes a new research agenda focused on robust simplicity to democratize LLM deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficiency methods favor hyperscale providers with extensive resources, leaving smaller organizations like hospitals, schools, and governments without viable options. The goal is to make LLMs accessible and sustainable for all.

Method: Proposes retrofitting pretrained models without retraining, lightweight fine-tuning, economical reasoning, dynamic knowledge management, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as benchmarks.

Result: Highlights the need for efficiency that reduces inequality and carbon waste, ensuring broader adoption of LLMs.

Conclusion: By prioritizing adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, LLM deployment can be democratized, benefiting a wider range of organizations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create transparent and efficient text embeddings without relying on data-driven methods like neural networks.

Method: Encodes tokens as harmonic trajectories derived from Unicode representations, ensuring bijective and interpretable mappings.

Result: Achieves Spearman correlation of 0.68 on STS-B, with stable performance across ten languages and minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that deterministic geometry can capture semantic relations, offering a viable alternative to traditional embeddings.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

Motivation: Address challenges in reward models for LLMs: low data efficiency and reward overoptimization.

Method: Uses reformulated instructions, aggregated rewards from diverse tasks, and averaged outputs with varying dropout rates.

Result: Effective in improving reward model performance.

Conclusion: PIRA successfully tackles key challenges in aligning LLMs with human preferences.

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

TL;DR: LLMs struggle in legal domain due to lack of pretraining; reorganizing legal documents and explaining terms improves performance by 1.5-4.36% F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal documents are complex, and LLMs lack domain-specific training, hindering their performance in legal tasks.

Method: Experiments include reorganizing documents, defining rhetorical roles, and emulating court reasoning in zero-shot settings on Indian legal datasets.

Result: Organizing data or explaining legal terms improves model performance (1.5-4.36% F1 score increase).

Conclusion: Structuring legal information and clarifying terms enhances LLMs' effectiveness in legal tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindSET is a new benchmark dataset from Reddit, offering over 13M annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, outperforming older benchmarks in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for mental health analysis are outdated due to limited data, poor cleaning, and diverse content. MindSET addresses these gaps with rigorous preprocessing and larger scale.

Method: MindSET was curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses, with preprocessing (language filtering, NSFW removal, deduplication) and linguistic analysis via LIWC. Binary classification experiments tested its utility.

Result: Models trained on MindSET achieved up to an 18-point F1 improvement for Autism detection over previous benchmarks.

Conclusion: MindSET provides a robust resource for mental health research via social media, enhancing early risk detection and psychological trend analysis.

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

### [108] [Semantics Meet Signals: Dual Codebook Representationl Learning for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20673)
*Zheng Hui,Xiaokai Wei,Reza Shirkavand,Chen Wang,Weizhi Zhang,Alejandro Peláez,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlexCode is a popularity-aware framework for generative recommendation, addressing imbalance between popular and long-tail items by using dual codebooks (CF and semantic) and MoE balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative recommendation methods use a single codebook, failing to balance collaborative signals for popular items and semantic understanding for long-tail items, limiting efficiency and generalization.

Method: FlexCode introduces dual codebooks (CF and semantic), adaptively allocates tokens, and uses MoE for balancing. It includes alignment and smoothness objectives for coherence.

Result: Experiments on public and industrial datasets show FlexCode outperforms baselines, improving accuracy and robustness for tail items.

Conclusion: FlexCode successfully balances memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation, offering a new perspective and improved performance.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

TL;DR: Ar-SParC is the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset, tested with GPT models and enhanced by the GAT corrector, showing performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of Arabic-language datasets for text-to-SQL tasks, enabling natural language interactions with databases.

Method: Created Ar-SParC dataset (3,450 question sequences), tested GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo with 10 prompt engineering techniques, and introduced the GAT corrector.

Result: GAT corrector improved performance by 1.9% EX and 1.9% IX (zero-shot), and 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX (in-context learning).

Conclusion: The GAT corrector enhances Arabic text-to-SQL performance, and Ar-SParC fills a critical gap in non-English datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study critiques large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in oncology decision support, highlighting flawed reasoning despite high benchmark performance. A hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors was developed and validated, revealing clinical risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns in LLM-driven oncology decision support, focusing on flawed reasoning not captured by accuracy metrics.

Method: Developed a three-tier taxonomy of reasoning errors using GPT-4 responses annotated from oncology notes (600 traces). Validated on 822 prostate cancer consult notes simulating clinical tasks.

Result: 23% of responses contained reasoning errors, notably confirmation and anchoring biases, leading to guideline-discordant recommendations, especially in advanced disease. Automated evaluators detected errors but failed to classify subtypes.

Conclusion: LLMs may produce unsafe recommendations due to reasoning flaws. The taxonomy offers a framework to improve reasoning fidelity before clinical use.

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dynamic Template Selection (DTS) improves token efficiency in LLM responses by matching query complexity to tailored response templates, reducing costs without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform prompting strategies waste tokens, especially costly output tokens, prompting the need for adaptive response methods.

Method: DTS uses MLP and RoBERTa routers to match queries with optimized response templates, evaluated on MMLU questions and API calls.

Result: MLP router outperforms RoBERTa (90.5% vs 89.5% accuracy) with fewer parameters, and generalizes across LLM providers (32.6%-33.9% token savings).

Conclusion: DTS offers a cost-effective, provider-agnostic solution for efficient LLM deployments, backed by theory and empirical validation.

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-prefix memorization framework to better identify verbatim memorization in LLMs, addressing gaps in existing definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing definitions of memorization in LLMs lack comprehensiveness, especially for aligned models, creating privacy and copyright risks.

Method: Proposes multi-prefix memorization, where memorized sequences are identified by the diversity of prefixes that retrieve them. Formalized via adversarial search.

Result: The framework effectively distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data in experiments on open-source and aligned chat models.

Conclusion: The multi-prefix memorization framework provides a robust tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs, improving privacy and copyright risk assessment.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods struggle with interpreting features captured by SAEs in LLMs, limiting safe deployment.

Method: SAGE uses an active approach: formulating explanations, designing tests, and refining based on feedback.

Result: SAGE outperforms baselines in generative and predictive accuracy for feature explanations.

Conclusion: SAGE enhances SAE interpretability, aiding safer and more reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSPy+HELM, a framework combining structured prompting (DSPy) with HELM benchmarking to improve LM performance estimates by addressing limitations of fixed prompts. It shows HELM underestimates LM performance without structured prompting and demonstrates the benefits of reasoning-based prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed prompts in existing benchmarking frameworks like HELM, which fail to generalize across LMs and underestimate performance.

Method: Developed DSPy+HELM, a reproducible framework integrating structured prompting methods (including chain-of-thought reasoning) to optimize prompts per task. Evaluated four LMs across seven benchmarks.

Result: Without structured prompting, HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% on average), shows higher variability (+2% standard deviation), misrepresents performance gaps (leaderboard flips on 3/7 benchmarks), and reasoning reduces LM sensitivity to prompts.

Conclusion: Scalable performance ceiling estimation through structured prompting enables more accurate and decision-useful benchmarks, as demonstrated by the DSPy+HELM framework.

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

TL;DR: The Length-MAX tokenizer reduces token count in language models by optimizing for average token length, leading to faster training, lower inference latency, and improved downstream performance compared to BPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize tokens per character for efficiency in training and inference without compromising performance.

Method: Uses a length-weighted objective maximization modeled as a graph partitioning problem, solved with a greedy approximation algorithm.

Result: Achieves 14-18% fewer tokens than BPE, faster training (18.5% fewer steps), lower inference latency (13.7%), and improved downstream task performance (e.g., 11.7% lower LAMBADA perplexity).

Conclusion: Optimizing for token length enhances language model efficiency and performance, with practical benefits like reduced memory usage.

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

Motivation: Current evaluations lack focus on dynamic memory accumulation and reuse in evolving task streams, limiting LLMs' real-world applicability.

Method: Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams and evaluates memory modules. It introduces ExpRAG and ReMem for experience retrieval and continual improvement.

Result: The framework is tested on 10 diverse datasets, showcasing the potential for LLMs to evolve memory dynamically during deployment.

Conclusion: Evo-Memory bridges the gap in dynamic memory evaluation, enabling LLMs to better accumulate and reuse contextual insights for long-term problem-solving.

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in argument mining for low-resource languages like Persian by leveraging high-resource languages like English.

Method: Three training scenarios: zero-shot transfer, LLM-based augmentation, and a cross-lingual model combining English and Persian data.

Result: The cross-lingual model achieved the highest F1 score (74.8%) on Persian, surpassing LLM-based augmentation (69.3%) and zero-shot transfer (50.7%).

Conclusion: A lightweight cross-lingual approach is more effective than resource-intensive augmentation for argument mining in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

Motivation: Understanding the internal mechanisms of LLMs that ground abstract semantic structure, as current characterizations are insufficient.

Result: Finds highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes), gradual structural refinement, and moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% overlap).

Conclusion: LLMs form compact mechanisms for abstract semantics, with partial transferability across scales and architectures.

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

Method: Chatty-KG uses LLM agents for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity/relation linking, and query planning, generating SPARQL queries for KG access.

Result: Achieves higher F1 and P@1 scores than baselines in single/multi-turn QA, with low latency and broad LLM compatibility.

Conclusion: Chatty-KG offers a scalable, extensible solution for reliable multi-turn KGQA, unifying conversational flexibility with KG grounding.

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

### [121] [TrackList: Tracing Back Query Linguistic Diversity for Head and Tail Knowledge in Open Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21006)
*Ioana Buhnila,Aman Sinha,Mathieu Constant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform best on definition-type queries but struggle with exemplification-type queries, with performance influenced by concept frequency and technicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the drop in LLMs' performance on diverse linguistic queries beyond definitions and assess the impact of pre-training data.

Method: Used TrackList pipeline and RefoMed-EN dataset to analyze LLMs' responses with syntactic/semantic metrics, correlations, and embeddings.

Result: LLMs excel at definition-type questions but perform poorly on exemplification-type ones, paraphrasing more on frequent knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs' performance varies by query type and concept frequency, highlighting limitations in handling diverse linguistic tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

### [122] [Semantic Anchors in In-Context Learning: Why Small LLMs Cannot Flip Their Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21038)
*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether in-context learning (ICL) can override pre-trained label semantics or just refines existing ones, concluding that ICL aligns inputs with stable semantic directions rather than remapping labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if ICL can change label meanings learned during pre-training or merely adjusts how inputs align with these semantics.

Method: Treats LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers, using natural and inverted demonstrations, and decomposes ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, prompt alignment). Introduces semantic override rate.

Result: Models maintain strong prior alignment with natural demonstrations and cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers with inverted ones. Semantic override rates remain zero.

Conclusion: ICL primarily aligns inputs with pre-trained semantic directions, showing limits of few-shot prompting in overriding label semantics.

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

### [123] [Context-Aware Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting for Sarcasm Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21066)
*Michael Iskandardinata,William Christian,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a retrieval-aware approach combining non-parametric web-based retrieval and self-knowledge awareness to enhance sarcasm detection in LLMs, showing significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection is challenging due to linguistic diversity and cultural nuances. Existing PLMs and LLMs struggle with unreliable detection and lack of contextual grounding.

Method: Proposes a retrieval-aware pipeline integrating contextual information via non-parametric web retrieval and self-knowledge awareness, building on Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP).

Result: Achieves a 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic with non-parametric retrieval, and 3.29%/4.08% on SemEval/MUStARD with self-knowledge retrieval.

Conclusion: Contextual retrieval significantly enhances sarcasm detection in LLMs, especially for culturally specific terms. Future work will optimize retrieval quality and relevance.

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

*Thura Aung,Eaint Kay Khaing Kyaw,Ye Kyaw Thu,Thazin Myint Oo,Thepchai Supnithi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are explored as alternatives to MLPs for classification in low-resource languages like Burmese, showing competitive or superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MLPs have fixed non-linearity, limiting expressiveness and increasing computational cost. The study investigates KANs as more efficient and expressive alternatives.

Method: Evaluated three KAN variants (FourierKAN, EfficientKAN, FasterKAN) across embeddings (TF-IDF, fastText, multilingual transformers) for classification tasks.

Result: EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928). FasterKAN offered the best speed-accuracy trade-off. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs (0.917 F1).

Conclusion: KANs are viable, efficient alternatives to MLPs for classification in low-resource languages, offering improved performance and flexibility.

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

### [125] [Orthographic Constraint Satisfaction and Human Difficulty Alignment in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21086)
*Bryan E. Tuck,Rakesh M. Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models on word puzzles requiring character-level constraints, highlighting architectural differences as more impactful than parameter scaling, and identifies challenges in handling orthographically atypical words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess how large language models perform under hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, addressing gaps in cross-architecture evaluations.

Method: Evaluated 28 configurations across three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) using 58 word puzzles, analyzing performance gaps, parameter scaling effects, and calibration with human difficulty ratings.

Result: Architectural differences caused larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x) than parameter scaling (83% gain). Models struggled with orthographically atypical words (e.g., 'data', 'poop') despite human success, revealing over-reliance on distributional plausibility.

Conclusion: Specialized architectural features or training objectives may be needed for constraint satisfaction, as scaling parameters or compute budgets alone proves insufficient for handling orthographically atypical but valid patterns.

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ASR error correction in low-resource Burmese, a previously unexplored area, by leveraging feature integration strategies.

Method: Sequence-to-sequence Transformer models with IPA and alignment features, evaluated on five ASR backbones.

Result: Reduced WER from 51.56 to 39.82 and improved chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627.

Conclusion: Feature design in AEC is crucial for enhancing ASR outputs in low-resource languages like Burmese.

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

*Manish Jain,Satheesh Kumar Ponnambalam,Salman Faroz,Chandrakanth Lns,Vinay Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MortgageLLM is a domain-specific LLM for mortgage finance, using a dual-track specialization framework to balance conversational and structured tasks, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of applying general LLMs to specialized domains like mortgage finance without losing instruction-following fidelity.

Method: Dual-track specialization framework from a base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B), employing two specialists (conversational Q&A and structured task models) and an instruction residual technique.

Result: Significant performance improvements over LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct in summarization (4.58 vs. 3.99), Q&A (4.09 vs. 4.0), and classification (2.6 vs. 1.2), with better semantic similarity scores.

Conclusion: MortgageLLM effectively bridges the gap between general LLMs and domain-specific needs, achieving superior performance in mortgage finance tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGASA, a framework to enhance reasoning models' safety against adversarial prompts by internalizing model-generated safety guidelines, improving robustness while minimizing unnecessary refusals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial jailbreak prompts covertly evade safety mechanisms, posing risks of harmful content generation, necessitating adaptive safety alignment.

Method: SGASA includes Data Pre-synthesis (generating safety guidelines and prompts) and Alignment Fine-tuning (using SFT and DPO to embed guidelines).

Result: Experiments show SGASA significantly improves model safety across datasets, proving its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

Conclusion: SGASA successfully strengthens model defenses against adversarial prompts while maintaining responsiveness to benign requests.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

*Steven Wang,Kyle Hunt,Shaojie Tang,Kenneth Joseph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs on small human samples improves simulated survey responses but still fails to match human data for inferential analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if fine-tuning LLMs on small human datasets can address alignment issues with human behavior in surveys and experiments.

Method: Conducted a behavioral experiment comparing human and LLM-generated responses on dimensions like distributional divergence and subgroup alignment.

Result: Fine-tuning improved heterogeneity and alignment but couldn't replicate regression coefficients from human data.

Conclusion: LLM-generated data is unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, addressing challenges like non-standard orthography and transcription consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a resource capturing authentic Isan speech phenomena and support inclusive AI development for underrepresented languages.

Method: Developed practical transcription protocols balancing accuracy and computational needs, using natural speech data.

Result: Produced an open dataset with natural Isan speech, including colloquials, prosody, disfluencies, and code-switching.

Conclusion: The dataset aids AI and linguistic research, addressing challenges in modeling conversational speech for Isan.

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

TL;DR: PEFT-Bench is introduced as a unified benchmark for evaluating Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods on LLMs, addressing limitations in current evaluations with a focus on reproducibility and comprehensive metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational and environmental costs of LLMs while maintaining performance, PEFT methods are developed, but their evaluations are limited and hard to reproduce.

Method: PEFT-Bench evaluates 6 PEFT methods across 27 NLP datasets and introduces the PSCP metric to consider trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory.

Result: The benchmark provides a reproducible and comprehensive evaluation framework for PEFT methods.

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench bridges the gap in PEFT evaluations, offering a standardized approach to assess performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

TL;DR: Study investigates Martin's Law in neural language models, revealing non-monotonic development of word frequency-polysemy relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural language models develop linguistic regularities like Martin's Law during training.

Method: DBSCAN clustering of embeddings to operationalize word senses; analyzed four Pythia models across 30 checkpoints.

Result: Non-monotonic trajectory observed; Martin's Law peaks then degrades. Smaller models collapse semantically; larger models degrade gracefully.

Conclusion: Linguistic regularity compliance in models follows a balanced trajectory, suggesting an optimal semantic window.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores training language models for introspective awareness, improving detection of injected 'thoughts' from near-failure to high accuracy, addressing questions about AI transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if introspective awareness in language models can be trained directly rather than emerging spontaneously, addressing Lindsey's open question about cross-model differences.

Method: Fine-tuning a 7B parameter model on transient single-token injections to train it for detecting and reporting injected 'thoughts.'

Result: The model improved from 0.4% accuracy to 85% accuracy with 0% false positives, demonstrating reliable detection and retention of semantic content.

Conclusion: Introspective behavior can be directly trained, offering a pathway to enhance AI transparency, though it doesn't confirm metacognitive representation.

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

*Antonín Jarolím,Martin Fajčík,Lucia Makaiová*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims in online comments, evaluates LLMs on a new dataset, and finds mixed performance results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation in online comments necessitates effective detection methods, requiring precise evidence extraction to support or refute claims.

Method: A new dataset with fine-grained evidence annotations is created. Large language models (LLMs) are evaluated for their alignment with human annotations.

Result: LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim, leading to errors. Some smaller models perform better than larger ones, with specific models balancing size and alignment effectively.

Conclusion: Smaller models like llama3.1:8b can outperform larger ones, while certain models strike a good balance between size and accuracy for evidence extraction.

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

Method: DSR-SQL models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state (refines schemas) and a progressive generation state (feedback-guided SQL synthesis).

Result: Achieves 35.28% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32% on BIRD development set.

Conclusion: DSR-SQL effectively addresses key challenges in Text-to-SQL tasks, offering competitive performance and promising future applications.

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

### [136] [Odin: Oriented Dual-module Integration for Text-rich Network Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21416)
*Kaifeng Hong,Yinglong Zhang,Xiaoying Hong,Xuewen Xia,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Odin is a novel architecture integrating graph structure into Transformers via an oriented dual-module mechanism, avoiding GNNs' limitations and outperforming existing methods in text-attributed graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail to effectively combine textual understanding with graph structure, either over-smoothing (GNNs) or ignoring topology (Transformers).

Method: Odin injects graph structure into Transformers at specific depths, decoupling structural abstraction from neighborhood size, and avoids multi-hop diffusion. Light Odin is a lightweight variant for efficiency.

Result: Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmarks; Light Odin maintains competitive performance with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Odin and Light Odin provide a unified, hop-free framework for structure-text integration, surpassing GNNs and Transformers.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model merging combines fine-tuned checkpoints into one model without extra training. Task Arithmetic is the only reliable method for LLMs, while others often cause performance drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if model merging benefits generalize from smaller models to LLMs, evaluating six merging methods across four LLMs and benchmarks.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of six merging methods, including subspace techniques, on four LLMs with twelve fine-tuned checkpoints each, tested on sixteen benchmarks.

Result: Task Arithmetic is the sole method consistently improving LLM performance; other methods typically degrade performance.

Conclusion: Current merging techniques don't work well for LLMs, highlighting the need for LLM-specific merging algorithms and fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism leveraging contextual information and a pairwise sorting algorithm to address text length and ordinal label issues, achieving superior performance in Chinese and English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for readability assessment often overlook text length and ordinal relationships between readability labels, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces a bidirectional mechanism for sentence-level readability prediction and a pairwise sorting algorithm to model ordinal label relationships.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed model outperforms baseline models on both Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The bidirectional mechanism and pairwise sorting algorithm effectively enhance readability assessment by addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

*Lina Conti,Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Guillaume Wisniewski,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how speech translation models assign gender to speaker-referring terms, revealing they learn broader masculine patterns and can override biases using acoustic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how speech translation models assign gender, addressing concerns of misgendering due to acoustic and linguistic biases.

Method: Investigates gender assignment mechanisms in ST models across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), analyzing training data, internal language model biases, and acoustic information. Uses contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms.

Result: Models learn broader masculine patterns rather than replicating term-specific associations. Higher gender accuracy models use first-person pronouns and distributed frequency cues, not just pitch.

Conclusion: ST models can override masculine biases with acoustic input, leveraging nuanced mechanisms beyond pitch for gender assignment.

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoParQ, a benchmark for evaluating cross-paraphrase consistency in LLMs, and proposes XParaCon, a metric to measure robustness. A reasoning-based SFT strategy improves model consistency, achieving results comparable to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often show inconsistent behavior with paraphrased questions, indicating reliance on surface patterns rather than semantic understanding. This limits their reliability.

Method: Developed RoParQ benchmark from existing datasets using paraphrases and a judge model to select inconsistent examples. Proposed XParaCon metric and a reasoning-based SFT strategy for alignment.

Result: Fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to larger pre-trained models, demonstrating improved robustness.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces superficial memorization and enhances LLM reliability, proving the value of targeted fine-tuning for semantic invariance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

*Dan Li,Hye-Bin Shin,Yeon-Woo Choi*

TL;DR: ProNECL is a novel framework for continual EEG decoding that avoids storing historical data by using class-level prototypes and cross-subject alignment, achieving strong performance without privacy or memory issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals vary significantly across individuals, making continual learning challenging. Storing historical data is impractical due to privacy and memory constraints.

Method: ProNECL uses class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative features and aligns new feature spaces globally via cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation.

Result: Validated on BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, ProNECL balances knowledge retention and adaptability, outperforming in cross-subject EEG decoding.

Conclusion: ProNECL offers a practical solution for continual EEG decoding without retaining historical data, addressing privacy and memory limitations effectively.

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

*Tsubasa Masumura,Masato Taki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a generalized relationship between modern Hopfield networks (MHN) and self-attention in Transformers, introducing modern Hopfield attention (MHA) to improve attention mechanisms and address issues like rank collapse and token uniformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge MHN and self-attention beyond the adiabatic approximation, seeking to enhance Transformer performance by leveraging Hopfield network insights.

Method: The authors introduce MHA, incorporating hidden states from MHN into self-attention, and validate its impact theoretically and empirically on Vision Transformers and GPT.

Result: MHA improves attention weights, mitigates rank collapse and token uniformity, and boosts accuracy without additional training parameters.

Conclusion: Hopfield networks offer valuable insights for advancing Transformer architectures, as demonstrated by MHA's effectiveness.

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to recover accuracy in pruned DNNs without accessing original training data, using synthetic images generated from Batch Normalization statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the challenge of accuracy degradation in pruned DNNs when original training data is unavailable due to privacy regulations, proposing a solution that avoids real data access.

Method: The authors use DeepInversion to generate synthetic 'dream' images from BN statistics of a pre-trained teacher model, serving as a transfer set for knowledge distillation to a pruned student network.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 with architectures like ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG show significant accuracy recovery post-pruning without real data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges model compression and data privacy, offering a viable solution for privacy-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

*Abolfazl Moslemi,Hossein Peyvandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based framework combining synthetic data generation and transfer learning improves Alzheimer's disease diagnosis accuracy by addressing data limitations and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease is vital for timely intervention, but challenges like limited labeled data and class imbalance hinder reliable ML models.

Method: The framework uses a class-conditional DDPM to generate synthetic data, Graph Transformers for representation learning, and transfer learning to enhance diagnosis.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on the NACC dataset.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers enhances generalization in low-data, imbalanced clinical settings.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

*Bilal Ahmed,Joseph G. Makin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePS is a novel framework using restart-based sampling with pre-trained diffusion models for solving inverse problems efficiently, avoiding costly backpropagation and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems face limitations like strong approximations, computational expense, or restriction to linear models.

Method: RePS leverages restart-based sampling and a conditioned ODE for any differentiable measurement model, with a simplified restart strategy to reduce errors.

Result: RePS shows faster convergence and better reconstruction quality in linear and non-linear inverse problems compared to baselines.

Conclusion: RePS provides a general, efficient solution for inverse problems, overcoming key limitations of prior diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Active Slice Discovery to identify and group systematic errors (error slices) in LLMs, aiming to reduce manual annotation by using active learning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving LLMs' performance on specific subsets (error slices) is crucial but challenging due to the need for manual annotation.

Method: The approach involves grouping errors likely from the same slice and verifying with limited annotator input, tested with different feature representations and active learning algorithms.

Result: Uncertainty-based active learning algorithms were most effective, achieving high accuracy with only 2-10% of slice membership data, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Active Slice Discovery, especially with uncertainty-based algorithms, efficiently identifies error slices, reducing reliance on extensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

TL;DR: PPO's instability in token-level training for LLMs is addressed with turn-level sampling and clipping-bias correction, leading to more stable and higher-performing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's instability in multi-turn dialogue tasks arises from misaligned token-level sampling and inaccurate advantage estimates.

Method: Introduces turn-level importance sampling and clipping-bias correction, tested as variants Turn-PPO, S-PPO, and ST-PPO.

Result: ST-PPO and S-PPO prevent collapses, maintain lower clipping ratios, and outperform standard PPO in multi-turn benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining turn-level sampling with clipping-bias correction stabilizes multi-turn LLM training effectively.

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI trustworthiness in safety-critical domains by providing comprehensive interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Proposes CHiQPM, which uses contrastive explanations for global interpretability and hierarchical explanations for local interpretability, including a conformal prediction method.

Result: CHiQPM achieves 99% accuracy comparable to non-interpretable models and offers efficient, interpretable set predictions.

Conclusion: CHiQPM successfully integrates interpretability and accuracy, supporting human-AI collaboration in critical domains.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large physics-focused foundation models develop human-understandable internal representations of abstract concepts, similar to language models. By manipulating these representations, the authors demonstrate causal control over the model's predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the phenomenon of interpretable internal representations is unique to models trained on structured data (like language) or a general property of foundation models.

Method: Extract activation vectors ('delta' representations) from a physics-focused model during simulations of different physical regimes, then inject these vectors back into the model to steer predictions.

Result: The model learns generalized representations of physical principles, allowing causal control over its predictions, such as inducing or removing specific physical features.

Conclusion: Scientific foundation models develop interpretable internal representations of abstract concepts, enabling new methods for understanding and controlling AI in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

*Aaron O. Feldman,D. Isaiah Harp,Joseph Duncan,Mac Schwager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing uses stochastic trajectory simulation, a nearest neighbor model, and conformal prediction to preemptively identify unsafe scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flight testing involves pilots performing maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters, leading to unexpected safety violations. The goal is to provide clear criteria for aborting maneuvers before violations occur.

Method: The approach includes predicting future states from recent observations, classifying safety using a nearest neighbor model, and calibrating the classifier via conformal prediction.

Result: Evaluated on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, the method reliably identifies unsafe scenarios, matches theoretical guarantees, and outperforms baseline approaches in preemptive risk classification.

Conclusion: The developed method effectively monitors runtime safety in flight testing, offering a broadly applicable solution for preemptive risk assessment.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

*Nicholas Pellegrino,David Szczecina,Paul W. Fieguth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses Initial Guessing Bias in untrained large neural networks, where random initialization favors a few classes, impacting early training dynamics. Loss function choice significantly influences this phase, with Blurry and Piecewise-zero losses potentially failing due to bias interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Initial Guessing Bias affects early training dynamics and how loss functions like Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss interact with this bias.

Method: Analyzing the impact of Initial Guessing Bias on early training, focusing on how different loss functions handle or struggle with this bias.

Result: Loss function choice dramatically affects early training phases, revealing challenges with Blurry and Piecewise-zero losses when dealing with Initial Guessing Bias.

Conclusion: Careful consideration of Initial Guessing Bias and loss function interactions is crucial for designing effective neural network training schemes.

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

*Reza Mansouri,Dustin Kempton,Pete Riley,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning surrogate model (SFNO) predicts solar wind velocity more efficiently than traditional MHD models, offering flexible and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for computationally efficient and accurate solar wind prediction models due to the limitations of traditional MHD methods.

Method: Uses an autoregressive machine learning approach (SFNO) to iteratively predict solar wind velocity over radial ranges, improving distant region accuracy.

Result: SFNO outperforms or matches the numerical HUX surrogate in performance, providing a trainable and data-driven solution.

Conclusion: The SFNO model introduces a novel, efficient methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling, addressing computational challenges.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Primal introduces deterministic feature mapping using prime square roots, offering robust and tunable vector representations with static and dynamic variants for various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a deterministic alternative to stochastic projection methods, leveraging number-theoretic properties for robust feature mapping.

Method: Primal utilizes prime square roots' Besicovitch property for irrational frequency modulations, offering two algorithms: StaticPrime for temporal encodings and DynamicPrime for tunable feature mapping.

Result: Empirical results show superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to Gaussian baselines, proving computational efficiency and mathematical rigor.

Conclusion: Primal presents a versatile, deterministic framework for feature mapping, outperforming stochastic methods and suitable for diverse applications like compressive sensing and privacy-preserving learning.

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

*David Szczecina,Nicholas Pellegrino,Paul Fieguth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-supervised pre-training (e.g., SimCLR, Barlow Twins) improves noise robustness in deep networks trained on noisy datasets, outperforming supervised methods especially at high noise rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks often overfit to noisy labels, degrading accuracy. Existing methods rely on clean data subsets, which may not be available.

Method: Pre-train a backbone with SSL (SimCLR/Barlow Twins) without labels, then fine-tune on noisy data via supervised training.

Result: SSL pre-training boosts classification accuracy and label-error detection (F1/Balanced Accuracy) across noise rates, with larger gains at higher noise.

Conclusion: SSL pre-training enhances noise robustness, matching supervised models at low noise and surpassing them at high noise without needing clean data.

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

*Nan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores state resetting in simulators with latent variables, proposing algorithms for selecting belief-state samplers under sampling-only access. It contrasts two formulations—latent state-based and observation-based selection—and their interactions with roll-out methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State resetting is crucial for planning and calibration but challenging in simulators with latent variables. Existing samplers vary in effectiveness, and selecting the best one without full access is nontrivial.

Method: The paper reduces the problem to conditional distribution selection and develops algorithms under sampling-only access. It compares latent state-based and observation-based selection, analyzing their interactions with different roll-out methods.

Result: Observation-based selection fails under Single-Reset but succeeds under Repeated-Reset, revealing nuanced trade-offs between formulations and roll-out methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions in belief-state selection, showing its complexity despite simplicity in appearance.

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

### [159] [Representation Integrity in Temporal Graph Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20873)
*Elahe Kooshafar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the integrity of dynamic graph embeddings, ensuring they truthfully reflect evolving networks. It identifies a validated metric and compares common models, highlighting neural methods' strengths and correlation with link-prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic graphs model real-world systems, but existing benchmarks lack measures for embedding integrity—how well embeddings reflect topological changes. This gap hinders interpretable and task-agnostic model evaluation.

Method: The authors formalize representation integrity and derive indexes to measure embedding fidelity to graph changes. They test 42 indexes on synthetic scenarios (Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, Periodic Re-wiring) to select a validated metric.

Result: A recommended index consistently ranks stable models (UASE, IPP) highest. Comparative analysis reveals neural methods' scenario-specific strengths and a positive correlation with link-prediction AUC.

Conclusion: The integrity framework provides a task-agnostic, interpretable tool for evaluating dynamic-graph embeddings, aiding model selection and future design.

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

### [160] [Probabilistic Hash Embeddings for Online Learning of Categorical Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20893)
*Aodong Li,Abishek Sankararaman,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Probabilistic Hash Embedding (PHE) for online learning with streaming categorical data, addressing issues like forgetting and order sensitivity seen in deterministic embeddings. PHE uses Bayesian online learning for scalable, memory-efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling evolving categorical vocabularies in streaming data is challenging, especially with deterministic embeddings suffering from forgetting and order sensitivity. The goal is to develop a robust, adaptive method for online settings.

Method: Introduces PHE, a stochastic hash embedding model using Bayesian online learning. It includes a scalable inference algorithm to update embeddings and latent variables incrementally.

Result: PHE outperforms deterministic methods in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation tasks, maintaining high memory efficiency (2~4x less memory than one-hot embeddings).

Conclusion: PHE effectively mitigates forgetting and order sensitivity issues in online learning, proving adaptable and scalable for evolving categorical vocabularies while conserving memory.

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

*Anil K. Saini,Jose Guadalupe Hernandez,Emily F. Wong,Debanshi Misra,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares three weight-generation methods (Genetic Algorithm, dataset characteristics, equal weights) to mitigate bias in machine learning models, finding GA-evolved weights offer better fairness-performance trade-offs, especially when optimizing accuracy and demographic parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biased predictions impacting marginalized communities by evaluating effective weight-generation methods for fairness-performance balance.

Method: Compared GA-evolved weights, dataset-characteristic weights, and equal weights across eleven datasets, measuring performance via predictive (accuracy, ROC AUC) and fairness metrics (demographic parity, subgroup false negative fairness).

Result: GA-evolved weights outperformed others in balancing fairness and performance, particularly when optimizing accuracy and demographic parity.

Conclusion: Choice of optimization objectives significantly impacts fairness-performance trade-offs, with GA-evolved weights excelling under specific metric combinations.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

*Yingchuan Sun,Shengpu Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of time-step sizes (1, 2, 4, 8 hours) in offline RL for sepsis management, finding that finer time-steps (1-2h) yield better performance and stability compared to the conventional 4h setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the coarseness of 4-hour time steps in RL for sepsis management, which may distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal policies.

Method: Empirical experiments comparing four time-step sizes (1, 2, 4, 8h) using identical offline RL pipelines, with action re-mapping methods for fair cross-time-step evaluation.

Result: Finer time-step sizes (1-2h) with static behavior policies achieved the best performance and stability, with varying trends across different learning setups.

Conclusion: Time-step size is a critical design choice in offline RL for healthcare, and alternatives to the 4-hour setup, particularly finer time-steps, show promise.

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cliff, a method for unsupervised disentanglement by promoting axis-aligned discontinuities (cliffs) in factor densities, outperforming existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to translate theoretical identifiability of quantized factors under diffeomorphisms into a practical criterion for unsupervised disentanglement, addressing the challenge posed by nonlinear maps.

Method: The proposed method, Cliff, encourages axis-aligned discontinuities (cliffs) in the estimated density of factors, ensuring these discontinuities are independent across factors.

Result: Cliff outperforms baseline methods on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges theory and practice by introducing Cliff, a practical criterion for unsupervised disentanglement based on axis-aligned discontinuities.

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

*Yaw Osei Adjei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares two BEC detection methods: CatBoost for psycholinguistic cues (low latency, high interpretability) and DistilBERT for semantic analysis (higher accuracy, higher cost). Both achieve high performance and ROI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEC causes significant financial losses, with a high cost asymmetry between false negatives and positives. Efficient detection methods are needed.

Method: Two detection streams: Forensic Psycholinguistic (CatBoost) and Semantic (DistilBERT). Evaluated on an adversarial dataset using Black Hole protocol.

Result: DistilBERT achieved AUC=1.0000, F1=0.9981 (higher accuracy), CatBoost AUC=0.9905, F1=0.9486 (lower latency). Both reduce false negatives effectively.

Conclusion: DistilBERT suits GPU environments for accuracy; CatBoost is cost-efficient for edge deployments. Both optimize ROI (>99.96%) by minimizing fraud losses.

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes clean-label backdoor attacks on Behavior Cloning (BC) policies, showing they remain vulnerable despite high task performance, and proposes a novel entropy-based trigger attack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness and vulnerabilities of BC policies trained on poisoned datasets, given their real-world deployment risks.

Method: Poisoning datasets with visual triggers to create spurious correlations, evaluating vulnerability based on data fraction, trigger strength, and type, and introducing an entropy-based test-time attack.

Result: BC policies trained on minimally poisoned datasets show near-baseline performance but are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks during deployment.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in BC policies and emphasize the need for more research into their robustness for real-world applications.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

*Shanwei Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the misalignment between LLM-generated subgoals and executable actions in RL by introducing SGA-ACR, a framework combining environment-specific subgoal graphs and multi-LLM planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based planning for RL suffers from poor planning-execution alignment due to semantically plausible but infeasible subgoals and conflated generation and verification.

Method: Proposes SGA-ACR, integrating environment-specific subgoal graphs, structured entity knowledge, and a multi-LLM pipeline separating generation, critique, and refinement. A subgoal tracker monitors execution.

Result: Tested on 22 tasks in "Crafter," the framework shows improved alignment and effectiveness.

Conclusion: SGA-ACR successfully bridges the gap between abstract LLM plans and executable actions, enhancing RL performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current noise injection methods in representation learning rely on heuristic or static noise, failing to adapt to dynamic feature distributions during training. This limits robustness and generalizability.

Method: The study systematically analyzes noise's role in representation learning using InfoNCE loss. It proposes FANoise, a feature-adaptive noise injection strategy leveraging contrastive learning dynamics.

Result: FANoise consistently enhances performance on multimodal tasks across various base Vision-Language Models (VLMs), mitigating negative noise impacts while preserving benefits.

Conclusion: FANoise provides a theoretically grounded, adaptive noise injection framework that outperforms static noise methods, advancing robust and generalizable representation learning.

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

### [168] [Estimating Ising Models in Total Variation Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21008)
*Constantinos Daskalakis,Vardis Kandiros,Rui Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two broad classes of Ising models, addressing computational and statistical efficiency in estimating models in Total Variation distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge gaps in existing methods for estimating Ising models, which vary in efficiency depending on specific conditions like tree-structured graphs or Gaussian interactions, by providing a unified framework.

Method: The method involves analyzing MPLE for two classes of Ising models: those with bounded operator norm and satisfying the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), and those with bounded infinity norm (width).

Result: The results demonstrate polynomial-time algorithms with optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees across diverse settings, leveraging tools like tensorization inequalities and concentration bounds.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by successfully unifying the analysis of MPLE for generalized Ising models, offering efficient solutions previously lacking in the literature.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

*Sid Bharthulwar,Stone Tao,Hao Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Staggered resets improve RL training by reducing harmful nonstationarity in massively parallel GPU environments, leading to better sample efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard synchronous resets in RL training with short rollouts introduce nonstationarity, skewing learning signals and destabilizing training.

Method: Introduces staggered resets—environments reset at varied points—to increase temporal diversity in training batches.

Result: Achieves higher sample efficiency, faster convergence, and stronger performance in high-dimensional robotics environments.

Conclusion: Staggered resets outperform synchronized rollouts, especially scaling well with more parallel environments.

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

*Taehoon Kang,Taeyong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an autoregressive conditional GAN (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction, outperforming traditional deep learning models by capturing nonlinear dynamics and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change increases wildfire frequency and severity, but existing simulators are computationally slow, and deep learning models often oversimplify fire spread dynamics. A faster, more accurate method is needed.

Method: An autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is used to model sequential state transitions for stable long-term predictions, capturing nonlinear wildfire spread dynamics.

Result: The CGAN-based model exceeds conventional deep learning models in predictive accuracy and fire perimeter delineation, effectively handling nonlinearity and uncertainty.

Conclusion: The autoregressive CGAN framework improves wildfire prediction accuracy and interpretability, aiding real-time decision-making for evacuation and response.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

TL;DR: ELBO$_\text{TDS}$ is a probabilistic framework addressing temporal distribution shift in recommender systems via causal modeling and data augmentation, showing improved accuracy and deployment success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal distribution shift degrades recommender system performance; existing methods fail to balance stability and adaptability.

Method: Uses statistical analysis to identify shifting factors, designs data augmentation, and applies causal modeling with ELBO$_\text{TDS}$.

Result: Achieves 2.33% GMV uplift per user and successful deployment in Shopee Product Search.

Conclusion: ELBO$_\text{TDS}$ effectively addresses temporal shifts, enhancing recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Method: Analyzed 780,000 records from 19,000 cows using AI techniques to predict longevity.

Result: Model achieved 83% accuracy in predicting herd life.

Conclusion: The AI model shows promise for practical dairy herd management.

Abstract: Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture is effective for AMC, demonstrating potential for adaptive spectrum management and cognitive radio applications.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing deployment is limited by the need for extensive site-specific training data and heterogeneous data/resource challenges in federated learning.

Method: FedAPA introduces adaptive prototype aggregation and a hybrid training objective combining classification and contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge.

Result: FedAPA outperforms baselines with significant improvements in accuracy (+9.65%), F1 score (+9%), MAE (-0.29), and communication overhead (-95.94%).

Conclusion: FedAPA effectively addresses heterogeneity in federated Wi-Fi sensing, enabling scalable and efficient non-invasive sensing.

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the safety-capability tradeoff in fine-tuning LLMs, focusing on RLVR's potential to maintain safety while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent safety-capability tradeoff in fine-tuning LLMs, the study explores RLVR as an alternative to SFT and RLHF, aiming to understand its safety implications.

Method: Theoretical analysis derives safety drift bounds under KL-constrained optimization, while empirical experiments across five benchmarks evaluate RLVR's impact on safety and reasoning.

Result: RLVR is shown to enhance reasoning capabilities without degrading safety, challenging the assumption of an inevitable tradeoff.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that RLVR can achieve both safety and capability objectives simultaneously, offering insights for safe LLM deployment.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

TL;DR: TDP improves decision efficiency in diffusion planning by distributing denoising steps over time, updating plans incrementally, and using automated replanming to maintain alignment with reality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead and low decision frequency caused by generating new plans at each time step in diffusion planning, inspired by human planning habits.

Method: Proposes Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP), which generates vague initial plans and updates them incrementally with fewer denoising steps, plus an automated replanning mechanism.

Result: TDP improves decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while maintaining or surpassing performance on D4RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: TDP effectively balances computational efficiency and performance by mimicking human-like planning strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

Result: Theoretical and experimental validation shows performance gains over unfiltered baselines in quality and safety-aware fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The unified framework improves LLM fine-tuning by optimizing data selection and generation, validated experimentally.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: G-Nets bridge neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, offering a new direction for robust binary/quantized deep learning models.

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models.

TL;DR: Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT) improves LLM alignment with biomedical knowledge by addressing overfitting and sparse data issues, outperforming SFT and enabling broader biomedical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like SFT and RL are limited in handling sparse biomedical data and lack practical reward signals for RL, necessitating a more effective post-training approach.

Method: BFT uses a two-layer weighting mechanism: token-level loss scaling to prevent overfitting and sample-level adaptive learning for hard samples.

Result: BFT outperforms SFT in medical and biological tasks, matching or surpassing specialized models like GeneAgent, and generates useful embeddings for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BFT enhances LLM performance in biomedical research by efficiently learning from sparse data, offering broad practical applications.

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems in physical sciences often face ill-conditioning, making solution steps sensitive. The goal is to develop a lightweight and efficient method to address this challenge.

Method: The Deceptron learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate using supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, spectral penalty, soft bias tie, and Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP). D-IPG applies inverse-preconditioned gradient descent with backtracking and stopping rules.

Result: On Heat-1D and Damped Oscillator problems, D-IPG achieves 20x and 2-3x fewer iterations, respectively, compared to projected gradient, and competes with Gauss-Newton. JCP reduces composition error and improves iteration gains.

Conclusion: The Deceptron and D-IPG offer an efficient solution for ill-conditioned inverse problems, demonstrating significant improvements in iteration counts and convergence speed.

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

TL;DR: MLPMoE is a training-free, deterministic method to convert dense MLPs in transformers into sparse, high-cardinality mixtures of experts, maintaining performance while reducing computational inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of dense transformers by leveraging sparse, semi-modular substructures without requiring calibration data or custom routing.

Method: Uses tensor slicing and summation to transform dense MLPs into static mixtures of experts, introducing Fractal Fade and Compensated Pruning for structured sparsity.

Result: Achieves minimal perplexity change (<0.05%) and reduces MLP parameters by ~20% while keeping perplexity within ~2% of baselines.

Conclusion: MLPMoE offers an efficient, post hoc solution for sparsity in transformers without additional training or calibration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

TL;DR: A novel framework uses hyperbolic geometry to bridge neuroscience literature and brain activation maps, outperforming traditional meta-analysis methods by capturing hierarchical structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the small sample size problem in neuroimaging studies, traditional meta-analysis methods often miss hierarchical brain structures.

Method: The proposed framework leverages hyperbolic geometry (Lorentz model) to embed text and brain images into a shared space, enabling multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by aligning embeddings, guiding hierarchy, and preserving relationships.

Result: The model outperforms baseline methods, providing robust and interpretable results for multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic brain-text representation offers a superior approach for neuroimaging meta-analysis by capturing semantic and hierarchical relationships effectively.

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) with Mixture of Attention (MoA) modules to improve fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals in multi-stage ranking systems, achieving notable performance boosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems lack effectiveness due to limited user-item interaction modeling, prompting the need for a more sophisticated approach like GESR.

Method: GESR employs MoA modules (Hard Matching Attention, Target-Aware Self Attention, Cross Attention) and Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) to enhance embeddings and integration, alongside optimization techniques for efficiency.

Result: GESR demonstrated significant improvements in key metrics and engagement tasks in both offline and online experiments.

Conclusion: GESR successfully addresses ESR limitations with its innovative attention mechanisms and optimization strategies, marking a scalable advancement in ranking systems.

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

*Hengyu Fu,Baihe Huang,Virginia Adams,Charles Wang,Venkat Srinivasan,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLMs offer fast parallel decoding but face bottlenecks due to reliance on high-confidence tokens, which carry little information. ETE strategy improves efficiency by balancing exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DLM decoding strategies are inefficient due to prioritizing high-confidence tokens, creating bottlenecks. A better approach is needed to maximize decoding efficiency.

Method: Introduces Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that combines cross-block decoding and targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens.

Result: ETE reduces decoding rounds without compromising generation quality, aligning with theoretical bounds.

Conclusion: Balancing exploration and exploitation in decoding (ETE) enhances DLM efficiency, overcoming the limitations of confidence-only approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

TL;DR: BRIDGE introduces structured prompting for scalable verified program generation by decomposing verification into code, specifications, and proofs, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scalability in verified synthesis across code, specifications, and proofs in interactive proof frameworks like Lean4.

Method: BRIDGE decomposes verification into three domains (Code, Specifications, Proofs) and uses structured prompting to align reasoning behaviors.

Result: Functional reasoning improves Lean4 code correctness by 1.5x (pass@5) and is 2x more efficient; specification-driven prompting boosts Python pass rates by 17.5%.

Conclusion: Structured domain alignment advances verified synthesis, laying groundwork for future training via expert iteration or RLVR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

*Tongkai Lu,Shuai Ma,Chongyang Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Dynamic Stratified Contrastive Training Framework (DySC) for MILP branching to address challenges like semantic variation, data scarcity, and imbalance in neural-based learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural-based learning frameworks for MILP branching face issues like semantic variation across depths, scarcity of upstream nodes, and costly strong branching sample collection. DySC aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: DySC groups nodes by feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based model to separate nodes progressively. It also introduces an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure to generate equivalent and perturbed instances for data augmentation.

Result: DySC improves branching accuracy and solving efficiency, especially for upstream nodes, and generalizes well to unseen instances in standard MILP benchmarks.

Conclusion: DySC effectively addresses key challenges in MILP branching, offering significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency while demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretable and fair clustering framework using decision trees, ensuring fairness across protected groups without needing hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fair clustering methods lack interpretability, which is crucial for high-stakes applications. The aim is to provide transparency in clustering decisions while ensuring fairness.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating fairness constraints into decision trees, including a variant that avoids fairness hyperparameter tuning via post-pruning.

Result: Experiments show competitive clustering performance, improved fairness, interpretability, and robustness under complex fairness constraints.

Conclusion: The method enables equitable and transparent clustering, handling multiple sensitive attributes and opening new possibilities for fair clustering applications.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the shift of AI from centralized to distributed creation, focusing on federated learning's potential and current gaps like accountability, scalability, and governance. It proposes cryptographic receipts, novelty measurement, parallel ownership, and time-locked policies as solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to realize the democratic vision of distributed AI creation by addressing gaps in federated learning, such as lack of accountability, economic mechanisms, scalability, and governance.

Method: The methods include using cryptographic receipts for aggregation proof, geometric novelty measurement to prevent gaming, parallel object ownership for scalability, and time-locked policies to prevent retroactive manipulation.

Result: The work aims to provide solutions that enhance federated learning's effectiveness by ensuring correctness, fairness, scalability, and governance integrity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that addressing these gaps can unlock the full potential of distributed AI creation, making federated learning more robust and scalable.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

TL;DR: CHMR is a framework integrating molecular and cellular responses via hierarchical modeling, outperforming existing methods on molecular property prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack integration of cellular responses and hierarchical dependencies across biological levels, limiting robust molecular property prediction.

Method: CHMR combines local-global dependencies between molecules and cells using a tree-structured vector quantization module for hierarchical modeling.

Result: CHMR improves classification by 3.6% and regression by 17.2% on 728 tasks across nine benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning enhances molecular representation reliability, providing a generalizable framework for biomedical modeling.

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

TL;DR: A framework is introduced to correct bias and build confidence intervals for LLM-based evaluations, addressing noise and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are scalable evaluators but suffer from noisy judgments and biased accuracy estimates due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity.

Method: A plug-in framework corrects bias and constructs confidence intervals, alongside an adaptive algorithm for efficient calibration sample allocation.

Result: The framework enables practical, statistically sound LLM evaluations by addressing uncertainty from test and calibration datasets.

Conclusion: This work provides a reliable solution for LLM-based evaluations by correcting biases and optimizing calibration sample usage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores gradient leakage attacks in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), finding they yield less informative reconstructions compared to conventional ANNs, highlighting SNNs' inherent privacy advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the vulnerability of SNNs to gradient inversion attacks in federated learning settings, given their non-differentiable nature and surrogate-gradient training.

Method: The authors adapt gradient leakage attacks to SNNs and compare the results with conventional ANNs across various data domains.

Result: SNN gradients produce noisy, inconsistent reconstructions, unlike ANNs, which reliably expose input content, indicating reduced gradient informativeness in SNNs.

Conclusion: SNNs' event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training inherently reduce privacy risks, making them promising for privacy-preserving neuromorphic computation.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex degradation mechanisms and uncertainty quantification in multi-sensor systems, limiting RUL prediction accuracy.

Method: The framework adapts RaPP as an HI, augments it with uncertainty quantification, and introduces indicator groups (I-GLIDE) to model sensor-specific degradations.

Result: The approach improves RUL prediction accuracy and generalizability, validated on aerospace and manufacturing datasets.

Conclusion: The work bridges anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a robust, uncertainty-aware framework for degradation modeling in complex systems.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

Conclusion: Advances Bangla sentiment analysis, offering a scalable solution for e-commerce analytics.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

Motivation: Accurate seismic response prediction is crucial for resilient structural design, but traditional FEM is computationally expensive. Data-driven deep learning models lack generalizability and physical understanding.

Method: Proposes a hybrid Physics-Informed U-Net LSTM model integrating domain-specific constraints into deep learning.

Result: The model outperforms conventional ML architectures in predictive performance.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combines data-driven and physics-based methods, offering a robust, efficient solution for seismic response prediction.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates exceptional flexibility and effectiveness for time-series synthesis.

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated unparalleled sampling quality and diversity in numerous fields, such as image generation, voice synthesis, and tabular data synthesis, etc. Inspired by those outstanding results, we apply SGMs to synthesize time-series by learning its conditional score function. To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

### [200] [Subjective Depth and Timescale Transformers: Learning Where and When to Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21408)
*Frederico Wieser,Martin Benfeghoul,Haitham Bou Ammar,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDT and STT, two Transformer architectures that use Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, improving efficiency for large-scale models and long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformer architectures suffer from rigid computation allocation, limiting efficiency and scalability. The goal is to optimize computation dynamically.

Method: SDT uses Decision and Dynamic layers for spatial routing, while STT extends this to temporal routing with residual updates and KV-cache management.

Result: Both architectures reduce self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache needs by 50%, showing a shift from novelty to prediction-driven gating.

Conclusion: SDT and STT offer a flexible, efficient framework for conditional computation, paving the way for more scalable models.

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDLMs face limitations in context comprehension, including locality bias and mask-related distractions, addressed by a new mask-agnostic loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates MDLMs' context comprehension abilities, identifying issues like locality bias and mask-induced distractions.

Method: Systematic ablations reveal limitations; a mask-agnostic loss function is introduced to mitigate mask distractions.

Result: Fine-tuning with the new objective improves MDLM robustness against mask distractions.

Conclusion: Current MDLM training has critical limitations, but actionable insights can enhance diffusion-based models.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

TL;DR: AIRL struggles with sparse rewards in complex, imperfect-information settings like poker. H-AIRL improves performance by adding a supervised loss and regularization, showing better efficiency and stability than AIRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AIRL's limitations in complex, uncertain environments like poker, where sparse rewards hinder performance.

Method: Proposes H-AIRL, enhancing AIRL with supervised loss from expert data and stochastic regularization. Evaluated on Gymnasium benchmarks and poker.

Result: H-AIRL outperforms AIRL in sample efficiency and stability, showcasing improved reward inference and policy learning.

Conclusion: H-AIRL is a promising framework for challenging real-world tasks, benefiting from supervised signals in inverse RL.

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

### [204] [The Directed Prediction Change - Efficient and Trustworthy Fidelity Assessment for Local Feature Attribution Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21363)
*Kevin Iselborn,David Dembinsky,Adriano Lucieri,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Directed Prediction Change (DPC), a novel metric for evaluating explanation fidelity in machine learning, offering speed and determinism over Monte Carlo-based methods like Infidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes settings like healthcare demand trustworthy explanations of ML models. Current fidelity metrics rely on random sampling, causing uncertainty and inefficiency.

Method: DPC modifies the Prediction Change (PC) metric by incorporating perturbation and attribution directions, eliminating randomness and speeding up evaluation.

Result: DPC achieves near-tenfold speedup, deterministic results, and matches local Infidelity's property. It's validated on diverse datasets, models, and explanation methods.

Conclusion: DPC provides a deterministic, efficient, and comprehensive tool for evaluating explanation fidelity, improving upon existing Monte Carlo-based metrics.

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangladesh faces frequent natural disasters, necessitating real-time monitoring and quick response systems.

Method: The framework uses transformer-based text encoders and CNN backbones for multimodal data fusion.

Result: The best model outperforms text-only (by 3.84%) and image-only (by 16.91%) baselines.

Conclusion: The study bridges a gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis, highlighting the advantage of combining data types.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

*Ben Anson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stabilizing neural network weights, especially queries and keys, is crucial in transformer training. While QK norm helps but isn't always applicable (e.g., MLA), controlling logit changes via parameter-dependent learning rates improves stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the instability of query and key weights in transformer models, especially where QK norm isn't feasible like in MLA.

Method: Assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to query and key weights to control logit changes.

Result: Enables higher base learning rates, outperforms alternatives in MLA, and matches QK norm performance in Multi-head Attention.

Conclusion: Parameter-dependent learning rates effectively stabilize weights and enhance model performance, offering a practical alternative to QK norm.

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

TL;DR: AAR dynamically excludes anomalies in contaminated datasets using adaptive thresholds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 0.041 AUROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection models assume clean training data, but contamination discrepancies degrade performance, especially in noisy environments.

Method: AAR uses modified z-scores and Gaussian mixture model thresholds to dynamically balance hard and soft anomaly rejection.

Result: AAR achieves superior performance (0.041 AUROC gain) on image and tabular datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AAR offers a scalable, robust solution for handling contaminated data, with potential applications in security and healthcare.

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

*Zachary Morrow,Michael Penwarden,Brian Chen,Aurya Javeed,Akil Narayan,John D. Jakeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SUPNs, a new shallow polynomial network, offer efficient function approximation with fewer parameters than DNNs and KANs, reducing optimization issues and achieving lower errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of DNNs and KANs—overparameterization, optimization challenges, and initialization sensitivity—by proposing SUPNs for simpler, more efficient approximation.

Method: SUPNs replace most hidden layers with a single polynomial layer, combining DNN flexibility with polynomial strengths. Theoretical convergence and quasi-optimal parameters are derived.

Result: SUPNs outperform DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in error and variability across various dimensions, even for non-smooth functions.

Conclusion: SUPNs provide a promising alternative for function approximation, balancing expressivity and efficiency while reducing optimization complexity.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

*Enes Bektas,Fazli Can*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the balance between ensemble size and classification performance by analyzing linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. It proposes that linear independence maximizes representational capacity and provides a theoretical estimate for optimal ensemble size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the trade-off between increasing ensemble size for better accuracy and avoiding computational inefficiency and diminishing returns.

Method: The paper analyzes linear independence among classifier votes under a geometric model and generalizes this to weighted majority voting. It derives a theoretical framework to estimate the required ensemble size for achieving linear independence. Experiments validate the theory using OzaBagging and GOOWE methods on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Result: The theoretical estimate accurately predicts performance saturation for robust ensembles (e.g., OzaBagging) but reveals instability in complex weighting schemes (e.g., GOOWE).

Conclusion: The framework provides insights into optimal ensemble sizing, balancing performance and computational efficiency, while highlighting challenges in complex weighting scenarios.

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: The paper explores training two-layer neural networks using consensus-based optimization (CBO), compares it with Adam, and introduces a hybrid method for faster convergence. It also reformulates CBO for multi-task learning and analyzes its mean-field limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural network training efficiency and memory usage by leveraging CBO and exploring its theoretical properties in the mean-field limit.

Method: Employ CBO and Adam for training, introduce a hybrid approach, reformulate CBO for multi-task learning, and analyze its mean-field limit using optimal transport and Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein dynamics.

Result: Hybrid CBO-Adam converges faster than CBO alone, and reformulated CBO reduces memory overhead. Theoretical analysis shows monotonic variance decrease in the mean-field limit.

Conclusion: CBO and its hybrid variant offer practical and theoretical advantages for neural network training, with potential applications in multi-task learning.

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning framework, improves accuracy in translating non-invasive signals like PPG and BCG to ABP by correcting temporal misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation harms accuracy, especially for critical features like ABP peaks. Existing methods (synchronization or LNL) are inadequate.

Method: Proposes ShiftSyncNet with TransNet (transformation) and SyncNet (time-shift correction). SyncNet learns time offsets and applies Fourier phase shifts for alignment.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8% on three datasets, showing improved label quality and transformation accuracy.

Conclusion: ShiftSyncNet effectively addresses temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological signal transformation, advancing continuous healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IntAttention introduces a fully integer-based attention pipeline to eliminate costly floating-point operations in Transformer models on edge devices, achieving significant speed and energy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The softmax operation in Transformer models is a major bottleneck due to its costly floating-point computations, disrupting efficient integer dataflow on edge hardware.

Method: IntAttention replaces floating-point operations with IndexSoftmax, integrating sparsity-aware clipping, a lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization.

Result: The method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines, with accuracy comparable to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: IntAttention enables efficient Transformer inference on edge devices without retraining, maintaining high accuracy while significantly improving performance.

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

TL;DR: The paper explores transformer interpretability for time series classification, adapting NLP techniques to uncover internal causal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are powerful but opaque; existing methods don't fully explain their internal mechanisms.

Method: Uses activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders to analyze attention heads and timesteps.

Result: Identifies causal structures and key components driving classifications; sparse autoencoders reveal latent features.

Conclusion: Provides insights into transformer mechanics and advances interpretability methods for time series tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning in discrete spaces, improving performance while ensuring safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety in reinforcement learning is crucial for real-world applications, but existing solutions like random sampling or fixed fallback controllers ignore future performance impacts.

Method: The authors introduce a predictive safety shield that updates the Q-function locally using safe predictions from environment simulations.

Result: Experiments show short prediction horizons suffice for optimal paths, and the method is robust to distribution shifts without extra training.

Conclusion: The predictive safety shield effectively balances performance and safety in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

*Martin Rabel,Jakob Runge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in analyzing spatially gridded time series data, focusing on causal graph changes to ensure stability and reliability. It develops principles and a modular framework to adapt existing causal discovery methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data, like climate data, exhibits spatial and temporal variations that can encode important information but also disrupt algorithms assuming stationarity. Understanding these variations is crucial.

Method: The framework modifies constraint-based causal discovery approaches at the independence testing level, making it modular and extensible. It integrates with existing methods (PC, FCI, PCMCI, etc.) without significant changes.

Result: The approach provides a flexible and widely applicable solution, enabling systematic improvement and understanding of subproblems related to causal discovery.

Conclusion: The modular design simplifies interpreting limitations and trade-offs, with potential extensions leveraging change-point detection and clustering. An open-source implementation is forthcoming.

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results.

### [216] [Computing Strategic Responses to Non-Linear Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21560)
*Jack Geary,Boyan Gao,Henry Gouk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses strategic classification, focusing on non-linear classifiers by introducing a novel Lagrangian dual optimization method to compute best responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches primarily handle linear classifiers, but non-linear classifiers are often more suitable. The inability to compute best responses for non-linear cases limits progress.

Method: The authors propose optimizing the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective to compute best responses, extending applicability to non-linear settings.

Result: The method works effectively in linear settings (exposing weaknesses in existing approaches) and is adaptable to non-linear classifiers for evaluation and training.

Conclusion: The presented method advances strategic classification by enabling best response computation for non-linear classifiers, filling a critical gap in the field.

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

### [217] [Machine Learning Approaches to Clinical Risk Prediction: Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment in Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21561)
*Wei-Chen Chang,Lu Dai,Ting Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSTAN, a risk prediction method for EHR data, addressing temporal irregularity and multi-scale dynamics with learnable alignment and multi-scale feature extraction. It outperforms baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in EHR data for better risk prediction.

Method: Introduces MSTAN with learnable temporal alignment, multi-scale convolutional feature extraction, and attention-based aggregation for fine-grained patient state representation.

Result: Experiments show MSTAN outperforms baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, proving its effectiveness in EHR analysis.

Conclusion: MSTAN offers a robust solution for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction and intelligent representation of medical sequences.

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

*Ali Amirahmadi,Gökçe Geylan,Leonardo De Maria,Farzaneh Etminani,Mattias Ohlsson,Alessandro Tibo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MD-GAK and PMD-GAK, simple yet effective kernels for cyclic peptide cell-membrane permeability prediction, focusing on uncertainty estimation and outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclic peptides are promising but face challenges in cell-membrane permeability due to limited data and uncertainty calibration needs.

Method: Introduces MD-GAK, a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel, and its variant PMD-GAK with a positional prior. Uses Gaussian Processes for uncertainty estimation.

Result: MD-GAK and PMD-GAK outperform state-of-the-art models across all metrics, with PMD-GAK reducing calibration errors.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer robust, reproducible solutions for cyclic peptide permeability prediction, emphasizing uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.

### [220] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically restructure hierarchies for optimal hyperbolic embeddings, improving embedding quality and enabling explainable reorganizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic embeddings are effective for hierarchical data but depend on input hierarchy structure. Existing hierarchies often lack optimal properties (high branching factor, single inheritance), prompting the need for automated restructuring.

Method: A prompt-based approach leveraging LLMs to reorganize hierarchies based on known criteria for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies validate the method.

Result: LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently improve hyperbolic embedding quality across standard metrics and provide explainable justifications for reorganizations.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively restructure hierarchies for better hyperbolic embeddings, offering both performance gains and transparency for knowledge engineers.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

### [221] [$A^2Flow:$ Automating Agentic Workflow Generation via Self-Adaptive Abstraction Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20693)
*Mingming Zhao,Xiaokang Wei,Yuanqi Shao,Kaiwen Zhou,Lin Yang,Siwei Rao,Junhui Zhan,Zhitang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: $A^2Flow$ is a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation using self-adaptive abstraction operators, outperforming baselines in performance and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability.

Method: $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage process: initial operator generation, clustering/preliminary abstraction, and deep extraction for abstract execution operators.

Result: Achieves 2.4% and 19.3% performance improvements and reduces resource usage by 37%.

Conclusion: $A^2Flow$ offers a scalable, generalizable solution for automated workflow generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: AssurAI is a Korean multimodal dataset designed to evaluate generative AI safety, addressing gaps in non-English contexts and multimodal coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety datasets are English-centric and lack coverage of non-English socio-cultural risks like Korean, prompting the need for AssurAI.

Method: A taxonomy of 35 AI risk factors was developed, followed by constructing AssurAI (11,480 instances across text, image, video, audio) with rigorous quality control.

Result: A pilot study confirmed AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing LLM safety, demonstrating its utility for Korean contexts.

Conclusion: AssurAI fills a critical gap in AI safety evaluation for Korean socio-cultural contexts and multimodal data, promoting safer generative AI development.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web introduces a novel method for efficient web automation by programmatically pruning DOM trees, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating complex webpages efficiently is challenging due to large DOM structures. Existing methods either lose critical information or lack scalability.

Method: Prune4Web uses DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where LLMs generate Python scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on sub-tasks, reducing resource-intensive LLM reading.

Result: Achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements, improving grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%.

Conclusion: Prune4Web offers a scalable and precise solution for web automation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChatDRex, a multi-agent system enabling natural language-based access to bioinformatics tools for drug repurposing, leveraging the NeDRex knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drug repurposing methods are fragmented and require specialized expertise, limiting accessibility for non-computer-science researchers.

Method: ChatDRex integrates specialized agents for tasks like data retrieval, network analysis, and validation, using NeDRex for biomedical knowledge.

Result: The system democratizes bioinformatics access, allowing clinical experts to explore drug repurposing without technical barriers.

Conclusion: ChatDRex accelerates novel therapy discovery by enabling seamless, natural language-driven bioinformatics workflows.

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

Motivation: To address challenges in scientific reasoning beyond fact recall, including physical assumptions and unit consistency in heliophysics.

Method: Created a dataset from NASA & UCAR problem sets, structured as Q&A with metadata. Used a programmatic grader for validation and benchmarked single-shot vs. multi-agent approaches.

Result: Multi-agent workflows, especially those decomposing tasks via systems engineering, outperformed direct prompting for deductive reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmarking approach advance scientific reasoning in heliophysics, highlighting the effectiveness of structured workflows.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Motivation: The study aims to explore the generalizability of Multimodal-CoT reasoning beyond scientific domains, focusing on benchmarks requiring commonsense and world knowledge.

Method: The paper implements a two-stage framework separating rationale generation and answer inference, using vision features fused with T5-based language models.

Result: Vision integration reduces rationale hallucination, but CoT effectiveness varies by question type, with commonsense reasoning being particularly challenging.

Conclusion: The work offers insights for multimodal reasoning systems and identifies areas for improving cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where autonomous LLM agents dynamically adapt network coordination strategies, outperforming static MAPC protocols in dense Wi-Fi environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAPC protocols lack adaptability to dynamic network conditions like interference and topology changes, necessitating a more intelligent solution.

Method: Each access point is modeled as an autonomous LLM agent that collaboratively reasons and negotiates adaptive strategies through natural language dialogue, memory, reflection, and tool use.

Result: Simulations show the framework effectively adapts to dynamic environments, significantly outperforming current spatial reuse baselines.

Conclusion: The Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework proves robust and intelligent, offering promise for future wireless networks.

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

TL;DR: OpenApps introduces an open-source ecosystem to evaluate autonomous UI-Agents across varied app designs, revealing significant reliability fluctuations due to app variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of autonomous UI-Agents rely on fixed environments, limiting insights into reliability across real-world app variations.

Method: Developed OpenApps, a lightweight ecosystem with six configurable apps, enabling thousands of app versions for testing. Conducted over 10,000 evaluations across seven multimodal agents.

Result: Reliability varies drastically across app versions, with task success rates fluctuating by over 50%. Agent behaviors like looping or hallucinating actions also differ with environment configurations.

Conclusion: Measuring reliability across app variations is crucial, as OpenApps demonstrates significant performance differences in agents beyond fixed environments.

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

Method: RILKE treats knowledge control as interventions in the model's representation space, learning paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules to minimize interference.

Result: RILKE achieves high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserves general utility with modest memory overhead in evaluations.

Conclusion: RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

### [232] [Guaranteed Optimal Compositional Explanations for Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20934)
*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations in deep neural networks, addressing the limitations of beam search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for compositional explanations rely on beam search, which lacks theoretical guarantees of optimality, prompting the need for a more reliable approach.

Method: The authors propose (i) a decomposition of factors influencing spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic for alignment estimation, and (iii) an algorithm for computing optimal explanations efficiently.

Result: In computer vision and CNNs, 10-40% of beam-search explanations are suboptimal, especially with overlapping concepts. Their guided beam-search variant improves runtime and flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework provides the first method for optimal compositional explanations, outperforming beam search in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

*Qineng Wang,Wenlong Huang,Yu Zhou,Hang Yin,Tianwei Bao,Jianwen Lyu,Weiyu Liu,Ruohan Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei,Manling Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ENACT, a benchmark to evaluate embodied cognition in vision-language models using visual question answering tasks, revealing performance gaps between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether modern vision-language models, trained passively, exhibit signs of embodied cognition, which arises from sensorimotor interaction.

Method: ENACT evaluates embodied cognition through forward and inverse world modeling tasks framed as POMDPs, with actions as scene graph changes. It uses QA pairs synthesized from robotics simulation.

Result: Experiments show a performance gap between models and humans, particularly widening with interaction horizon. Models perform better on inverse tasks and display anthropocentric biases.

Conclusion: ENACT highlights the limitations of current VLMs in embodied cognition and underscores the need for models to better emulate human-like sensorimotor interaction.

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ivy, an AI coaching system, combines symbolic TMK models with LLMs to generate structured explanations for procedural skill learning, outperforming GPT baselines in structural quality.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In procedural skill learning, explanations must convey causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic. Current LLMs often produce shallow responses lacking this depth.


Method: Ivy integrates symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with an LLM. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions to guide the LLM.


Result: Evaluations show symbolic constraints improve explanation quality for "how" and "why" questions compared to GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines.


Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable AI-for-education approach that enhances pedagogical value in AI-generated explanations.


Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICPO enhances RLVR by using intrinsic confidence and preference modeling to improve reasoning in LLMs, outperforming GRPO in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from issues like coarse-grained rewards, noise, and inefficient exploration, leading to unstable training.

Method: ICPO calculates preference advantage scores based on LLM response probabilities, integrating them with verifiable rewards to guide exploration.

Result: ICPO alleviates reward issues, reduces overconfidence errors, and improves exploration, demonstrating better performance than GRPO across benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICPO effectively addresses RLVR challenges, enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

### [236] [OVOD-Agent: A Markov-Bandit Framework for Proactive Visual Reasoning and Self-Evolving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21064)
*Chujie Wang,Jianyu Lu,Zhiyuan Luo,Xi Chen,Chu He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection, using Visual-CoT and w-MDP for improved object detection across rare categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) methods rely on fixed category names, limiting their generalization despite multimodal pretraining. Improving textual representation can enhance performance, suggesting untapped potential in the textual space.

Method: OVOD-Agent introduces Visual-CoT for interpretable textual optimization and models visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP). A Bandit module guides exploration, and Markov transition matrices integrate with Bandit trajectories for Reward Model optimization.

Result: Experiments on COCO and LVIS demonstrate consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, especially for rare categories.

Conclusion: OVOD-Agent effectively bridges the gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference, enhancing OVOD performance through proactive reasoning and self-evolving detection.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: The paper abstracts Halpern and Pearl's causality definition to apply it broadly, handling complex formulas and extending to explanation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize Halpern and Pearl's causality definition for wider applicability, including models with backtracking and complex formulas.

Method: Abstract key features of the causality definition to apply it beyond causal models, focusing on counterfactuals.

Result: Enables causality determination for complex formulas (disjunctions, negations, beliefs, nested counterfactuals) and extends to abstract explanation definitions.

Conclusion: Abstracting the definition broadens applicability, deepens understanding, and extends utility to explanation models.

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme weather events are increasingly threatening global society, but current diagnostic methods are labor-intensive and slow. There's a gap in AI-driven diagnostic reasoning despite advances in prediction.

Method: EWE uses knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a meteorological toolkit to autonomously analyze raw data and produce multimodal visualizations.

Result: The framework includes a benchmark with 103 high-impact events and a step-wise evaluation metric, demonstrating EWE's capability for comprehensive diagnostics.

Conclusion: EWE advances automated scientific discovery and democratizes expertise, especially benefiting developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

*Junjian Wang,Lidan Zhao,Xi Sheryl Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MADRA is a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that improves safety awareness in embodied AI agents by leveraging collective reasoning and iterative deliberation, reducing false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to risky tasks. It outperforms existing methods in safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for safe embodied AI agents in household environments, where dangerous instructions pose risks, drives this work. Existing methods are either computationally expensive or prone to over-rejection.

Method: MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate instruction safety, guided by a critical evaluator scoring responses on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Consensus voting and iterative deliberation enhance safety awareness. A hierarchical cognitive framework integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution for task success.

Result: Experiments show MADRA achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while keeping safe-task rejection low, outperforming existing methods in safety and execution efficiency.

Conclusion: MADRA provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for trustworthy embodied agents, balancing safety and task performance effectively.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

### [241] [SpatialBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Spatial Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21471)
*Peiran Xu,Sudong Wang,Yao Zhu,Jianing Li,Yunjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical spatial cognition framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), proposing SpatialBench, a benchmark covering 15 tasks across five cognitive levels. It highlights performance gaps between MLLMs and humans in spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify spatial cognition in MLLMs, lacking granularity to assess hierarchical abilities. The paper aims to address this gap by developing a structured framework and benchmark.

Method: A hierarchical framework decomposes spatial intelligence into five levels. SpatialBench, with 15 tasks, aligns with these levels. A capability-oriented metric evaluates performance across heterogeneous tasks.

Result: Experiments show MLLMs excel in perception but struggle with symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Humans outperform MLLMs in goal-directed abstraction.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a systematic framework for assessing hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, highlighting current limitations and laying groundwork for future spatially intelligent systems.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

*Yanxing Huang,Zihan Tang,Zejin Lin,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pessimistic verification improves error detection in open-ended math questions by using multiple parallel verifications, outperforming benchmarks without high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in verification performance, particularly error detection, for open-ended math questions.

Method: Introduces pessimistic verification: multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, deeming it incorrect if any report an error.

Result: Significantly improves performance across math verification benchmarks, surpassing token efficiency of extended long-CoT. Case studies reveal underestimated performance due to dataset annotation errors.

Conclusion: Pessimistic verification enhances reliability and performance of language model outputs for math tasks, suggesting broader application potential.

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates AI models' ability to disclose their AI identity in expert roles, revealing inconsistent transparency across domains and models, influenced by training factors, not size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess trustworthiness of AI models in high-stakes professional contexts by evaluating their self-transparency and consistency in disclosing their AI identity.

Method: Sixteen open-weight models (4B to 671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials using a common-garden design, focusing on disclosure rates in different professional personas.

Result: Disclosure rates varied widely (2.8%-73.6%), with domain-specific inconsistency (e.g., 30.8% for Financial Advisor vs. 3.5% for Neurosurgeon). Model identity and training factors were stronger predictors than size. Reasoning optimization reduced transparency.

Conclusion: Transparency is inconsistent and influenced by training, not scale. Organizations must verify behavior empirically and design for safety in deployment contexts.

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address future uncertainties and global challenges ethically using AI-enhanced foresight tools.

Method: Explores AI-driven foresight tools, computational modeling, and simulations for proactive policymaking.

Result: AI enhances risk evaluation and strategy development for sustainable futures, complementing human judgment.

Conclusion: AI should integrate thoughtfully into foresight practices to support resilient, ethical decision-making.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTTR-A, a metric to measure cognitive recovery latency in multi-agent systems, and benchmarks its effectiveness using simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems is challenging to quantify, especially regarding reasoning coherence recovery.

Method: Adapts classical reliability metrics (MTTR, MTBF) into cognitive domains, introducing MTTR-A. Benchmarked via simulations using AG News corpus and LangGraph framework.

Result: Automated reflexes averaged 6s recovery, human-approval took 12s. Median MTTR-A was 6.21±2.14s, MTBF=6.7±2.14s, NRR=0.08.

Conclusion: MTTR-A standardizes cognitive recovery measurement, enhancing runtime dependability in agentic systems.

Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.
  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.
  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A novel collective learning-based framework improves decentralized EV charging coordination by balancing driver comfort and system efficiency, outperforming existing methods under contingencies like station outages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized EV charging methods fail under severe contingencies, leading to long queues and reduced comfort.

Method: A collective learning-based coordination framework recommends adaptive charging behaviors to balance comfort and efficiency.

Result: The framework reduces travel and queuing time, showing better resilience under outages and adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The approach enhances decentralized EV charging infrastructure by optimizing trade-offs between comfort and efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces major challenges for decentralized charging control. Existing decentralized approaches efficiently coordinate a large number of EVs to select charging stations while reducing energy costs, preventing power peak and preserving driver privacy. However, they often struggle under severe contingencies, such as station outages or unexpected surges in charging requests. These situations create competition for limited charging slots, resulting in long queues and reduced driver comfort. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collective learning-based coordination framework that allows EVs to balance individual comfort on their selections against system-wide efficiency, i.e., the overall queues across all stations. In the framework, EVs are recommended for adaptive charging behaviors that shift priority between comfort and efficiency, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying station capacities and dynamic spatio-temporal EV distribution. Experiments using real-world data from EVs and charging stations show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, significantly reducing travel and queuing time. The results reveal that, under uncertain charging conditions, EV drivers that behave selfishly or altruistically at the right moments achieve shorter waiting time than those maintaining moderate behavior throughout. Our findings under high fractions of station outages and adversarial EVs further demonstrate improved resilience and trustworthiness of decentralized EV charging infrastructure.

Motivation: The study addresses the lack of evaluation benchmarks for LLM autonomy in multi-agent systems, proposing Tool-RoCo to assess cooperation and self-organization through tool usage.

Method: Tool-RoCo introduces cooperative tools and four LLM paradigms (centralized/decentralized cooperation and self-organization) evaluated across three tasks (SORT, PACK, CABINET).

Result: Cooperative tools were rarely used (7.09%), while activation tools dominated (96.42%), showing LLMs' preference for maintaining active agents over adaptive coordination.

Conclusion: Tool-RoCo systematically evaluates LLM autonomy and cooperation, revealing current models' coordination challenges and providing a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: This study proposes Tool-RoCo, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-term multi-agent cooperation based on RoCo, a multi-robot cooperative benchmark. Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has relied on predefined orchestration, while ignoring agent autonomy. Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization. Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls. Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage. The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants. Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination. Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks. Code and Demo: https://github.com/ColaZhang22/Tool-Roco

TL;DR: BAMAS is a budget-aware multi-agent system framework that optimizes LLM selection and collaboration topology to reduce costs while maintaining performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems lack consideration for budget constraints, limiting their practical deployment as complexity scales.

Method: BAMAS uses Integer Linear Programming to select optimal LLMs and reinforcement learning to determine collaboration topology.

Result: BAMAS reduces costs by up to 86% while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BAMAS effectively addresses budget constraints in multi-agent systems without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling autonomous agents to solve complex tasks. As these systems scale in complexity, cost becomes an important consideration for practical deployment. However, existing work rarely addresses how to structure multi-agent systems under explicit budget constraints. In this paper, we propose BAMAS, a novel approach for building multi-agent systems with budget awareness. BAMAS first selects an optimal set of LLMs by formulating and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that balances performance and cost. It then determines how these LLMs should collaborate by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method to select the interaction topology. Finally, the system is instantiated and executed based on the selected agents and their collaboration topology. We evaluate BAMAS on three representative tasks and compare it with state-of-the-art agent construction methods. Results show that BAMAS achieves comparable performance while reducing cost by up to 86%.
