### [1] [Saddle-Free Guidance: Improved On-Manifold Sampling without Labels or Additional Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21863)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Wilson Fearn,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces saddle-free guidance (SFG), a method to guide score-based generative models using positive curvature of log density estimates, eliminating the need for labeled data or additional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods like Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Auto-Guidance require labeled data or additional training, limiting their applicability. SFG addresses these limitations.

Method: SFG leverages the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions to guide generation without extra training or labeled data.

Result: SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics for unconditional ImageNet-512 generation and improves diversity while maintaining fidelity in FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5.

Conclusion: SFG provides an efficient and effective alternative to existing guidance methods, enabling high-quality generation without additional training or labeled data.

Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.

### [2] [UniArt: Unified 3D Representation for Generating 3D Articulated Objects with Open-Set Articulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21887)
*Bu Jin,Weize Li,Songen Gu,Yupeng Zheng,Yuhang Zheng,Zhengyi Zhou,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniArt is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes articulated 3D objects from a single image, unifying geometry, texture, segmentation, and kinematic parameters. It introduces reversible joint-to-voxel embedding and open-set articulation type prediction, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual construction of articulated 3D objects is costly and hard to scale, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: UniArt uses a diffusion-based approach with unified latent representation and reversible joint-to-voxel embedding. It predicts articulation types as an open-set problem.

Result: UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy on PartNet-Mobility.

Conclusion: UniArt offers an end-to-end solution for articulated 3D object synthesis, generalizing to novel joint categories and object types.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects play a vital role in realistic simulation and embodied robotics, yet manually constructing such assets remains costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types. Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy.

### [3] [PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902)
*Kunpeng Zhang,Hanwen Xu,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathReasoning is a multi-modal reasoning agent that efficiently navigates Whole Slide Images (WSIs) through iterative reasoning and refinements, outperforming traditional methods in cancer diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deciphering the tumor microenvironment in WSIs is crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment but challenging due to their massive size.

Method: PathReasoning iteratively navigates WSIs by sampling, reasoning, and refining regions, building a reasoning chain to focus on diagnostically relevant areas.

Result: It achieves 6.7% and 3.1% higher AUROC in subtyping and longitudinal analysis, and improves report accuracy by 10% over GPT-4o.

Conclusion: PathReasoning enhances efficiency, interpretability, and accuracy in digital pathology by prioritizing question-specific regions and providing traceable reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.

### [4] [Interpretable Multimodal Cancer Prototyping with Whole Slide Images and Incompletely Paired Genomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21937)
*Yupei Zhang,Yating Huang,Wanming Hu,Lequan Yu,Hujun Yin,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flexible multimodal framework integrates whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology, addressing heterogeneity and missing data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity hinders effective multimodal integration in precision oncology, and existing methods often overlook incomplete genomics.

Method: Proposes four components: Biological Prototyping, Multiview Alignment, Bipartite Fusion, and Semantic Genomics Imputation.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates multimodal data for precision oncology, even with incomplete genomics.

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate histology and genomics hold strong potential for precision oncology. However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

### [5] [AmodalGen3D: Generative Amodal 3D Object Reconstruction from Sparse Unposed Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21945)
*Junwei Zhou,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AmodalGen3D is a generative framework for reconstructing complete 3D objects from sparse, occluded views, outperforming traditional methods by integrating 2D amodal completion and multi-view stereo geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in reconstructing 3D objects from few unposed, partially occluded views, where traditional methods often fail to produce complete or consistent results.

Method: AmodalGen3D combines 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry, using View-Wise Cross Attention for sparse-view feature fusion and Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention for inferring unobserved structures.

Result: Experiments show AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness in occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: AmodalGen3D effectively addresses the need for robust 3D object reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and AI applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a few unposed and partially occluded views is a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios, where many object surfaces are never directly observed. Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle under such conditions, often yielding incomplete or geometrically inconsistent reconstructions. We introduce AmodalGen3D, a generative framework for amodal 3D object reconstruction that infers complete, occlusion-free geometry and appearance from arbitrary sparse inputs. The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings, addressing a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications.

### [6] [TAPVid-360: Tracking Any Point in 360 from Narrow Field of View Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21946)
*Finlay G. C. Hudson,James A. D. Gardner,William A. P. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPVid-360 introduces a novel task for predicting 3D directions to scene points beyond the field of view, leveraging 360 videos for training and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision systems lack panoramic understanding, especially in tracking points outside the visible field. TAPVid-360 addresses this gap.

Method: Uses 360 videos resampled into narrow perspectives for supervision, adapting CoTracker v3 to predict directional updates without 4D ground truth.

Result: Outperforms existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods, demonstrating improved allocentric scene representation.

Conclusion: TAPVid-360 advances persistent scene understanding and directional tracking, offering a scalable solution without complex ground truth data.

Abstract: Humans excel at constructing panoramic mental models of their surroundings, maintaining object permanence and inferring scene structure beyond visible regions. In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

### [7] [WalkCLIP: Multimodal Learning for Urban Walkability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21947)
*Shilong Xiang,JangHyeon Lee,Min Namgung,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WalkCLIP integrates satellite imagery, street views, and population data to predict urban walkability, outperforming single-source methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional walkability assessments are costly and limited; existing single-source methods miss key dimensions of the walking environment.

Method: WalkCLIP uses GPT-4o captions, spatial aggregation, and population dynamics to create multimodal walkability predictions.

Result: WalkCLIP outperforms baselines in accuracy and spatial alignment across 4,660 locations in Minneapolis-Saint Paul.

Conclusion: Combining visual and behavioral signals enhances walkability predictions, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Urban walkability is a cornerstone of public health, sustainability, and quality of life. Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.

In addition to strong classification performance, the approach includes explainable AI via Grad-CAM visualization, enabling identification of image regions most influential to model predictions and enhancing clinical interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate the potential for robust, accurate, and interpretable medical image analysis even in complex real-world conditions. This work contributes original benchmarks, comparative insights, and visual explanations, advancing the landscape of gastrointestinal computer-aided diagnosis and underscoring the importance of diverse, clinically relevant datasets and model explainability in medical AI research.

*Guying Lin,Kemeng Huang,Michael Liu,Ruihan Gao,Hanke Chen,Lyuhao Chen,Beijia Lu,Taku Komura,Yuan Liu,Jun-Yan Zhu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAT3D is a physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics simulations to create realistic, interaction-ready 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating physically plausible and simulation-ready 3D scenes from text prompts, overcoming limitations like interpenetrations and lack of physical realism in prior work.

Method: PAT3D combines vision-language models with a differentiable rigid-body simulator to generate hierarchical scene trees, optimize for physical stability and semantic consistency, and ensure intersection-free scenes.

Result: Experiments show PAT3D outperforms existing methods in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality, while enabling downstream tasks like scene editing and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: PAT3D advances text-to-3D scene generation by integrating physics-based simulation, offering high-quality, simulation-ready outputs for practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce PAT3D, the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics-based simulation to produce physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes. Given a text prompt, PAT3D generates 3D objects, infers their spatial relations, and organizes them into a hierarchical scene tree, which is then converted into initial conditions for simulation. A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations. To further enhance scene quality, we introduce a simulation-in-the-loop optimization procedure that guarantees physical stability and non-intersection, while improving semantic consistency with the input prompt. Experiments demonstrate that PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality. Beyond high-quality generation, PAT3D uniquely enables simulation-ready 3D scenes for downstream tasks such as scene editing and robotic manipulation. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

### [10] [DialBench: Towards Accurate Reading Recognition of Pointer Meter using Large Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21982)
*Futian Wang,Chaoliu Weng,Xiao Wang,Zhen Chen,Zhicheng Zhao,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RPM-10K, a large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, and MRLM, a vision-language model leveraging physical relations to improve pointer meter recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reading pointer meters are fragile due to challenges like reflections and occlusions. A lack of large datasets hinders robust algorithm development.

Method: Proposes MRLM, a vision-language model that encodes geometric and causal relationships between pointers and scales, using cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection.

Result: Extensive experiments validate MRLM's effectiveness on the newly created RPM-10K dataset.

Conclusion: The RPM-10K dataset and MRLM framework address key challenges in pointer meter recognition, achieving precise readings.

Abstract: The precise reading recognition of pointer meters plays a key role in smart power systems, but existing approaches remain fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and overly between thin pointers and scale markings. Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings. Extensive experiments fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on the newly proposed benchmark dataset. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/DialBench

### [11] [PPBoost: Progressive Prompt Boosting for Text-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21984)
*Xuchen Li,Hengrui Gu,Mohan Zhang,Qin Liu,Zhen Tan,Xinyuan Zhu,Huixue Zhou,Tianlong Chen,Kaixiong Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPBoost enhances medical image segmentation by transforming weak text prompts into strong visual prompts, improving spatial precision without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-prompted models lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shifts, while visual-prompted models require costly precise prompts. PPBoost bridges this gap.

Method: PPBoost uses vision-language models to generate pseudo-bboxes from text, filters unreliable predictions, trains a pseudo-labeled detector, and refines prompts during inference.

Result: PPBoost improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance across diverse datasets, surpassing few-shot models without labeled data.

Conclusion: PPBoost effectively transforms weak text cues into strong spatial guidance, generalizing to multiple segmentation backbones.

Abstract: Text-prompted foundation models for medical image segmentation offer an intuitive way to delineate anatomical structures from natural language queries, but their predictions often lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift. In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal LLMs lack real-time interactive guidance capabilities, especially detecting and correcting user mistakes during task execution.

Method: The authors introduce Qualcomm Interactive Cooking, a dataset with annotated instructions and feedback, including mistake alerts timed to video events. They evaluate existing LLMs and propose LiveMamba, a streaming LLM for interactive coaching.

Result: The paper provides the first benchmark for live coaching and introduces LiveMamba as a strong baseline model.

Conclusion: This work advances the development of AI assistants capable of real-time interactive guidance by offering a dedicated benchmark and an effective model.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) have advanced conversational abilities but struggle with providing live, interactive step-by-step guidance, a key capability for future AI assistants. Effective guidance requires not only delivering instructions but also detecting their successful execution, as well as identifying and alerting users to mistakes, all of which has to happen in real-time. This requires models that are not turn-based, but that can react asynchronously to a video stream, as well as video data showing users performing tasks including mistakes and their corrections. To this end, we introduce Qualcomm Interactive Cooking, a new benchmark and dataset built upon CaptainCook4D, which contains user mistakes during task execution. Our dataset and benchmark features densely annotated, timed instructions and feedback messages, specifically including mistake alerts precisely timestamped to their visual occurrence in the video. We evaluate state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs on the Qualcomm Interactive Cooking benchmark and introduce LiveMamba, a streaming multi-modal LLM designed for interactive instructional guidance. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark and a strong baseline for developing and evaluating on live, situated coaching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New acceleration pipeline improves Rectified Flow models' speed by 611%, outpacing current methods (18%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing acceleration methods don't apply to Rectified Flow models due to theoretical differences.

Method: Implemented pipeline with new velocity field batch processing, vectorization, and dynamic TensorRT compilation.

Result: Achieved up to 611% speedup in 512*512 image generation vs. current 18%.

Conclusion: Proposed pipeline significantly outperforms non-generalized acceleration methods.

Abstract: New technologies such as Rectified Flow and Flow Matching have significantly improved the performance of generative models in the past two years, especially in terms of control accuracy, generation quality, and generation efficiency. However, due to some differences in its theory, design, and existing diffusion models, the existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied to the Rectified Flow model. In this article, we have comprehensively implemented an overall acceleration pipeline from the aspects of theory, design, and reasoning strategies. This pipeline uses new methods such as batch processing with a new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for the new methods to comprehensively accelerate related models based on flow models. Currently, the existing public methods usually achieve an acceleration of 18%, while experiments have proved that our new method can accelerate the 512*512 image generation speed to up to 611%, which is far beyond the current non-generalized acceleration methods.

*Chunzheng Zhu,Yangfang Lin,Shen Chen,Yijun Wang,Jianxin Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedEyes enhances medical AI by modeling clinician-style reasoning with off-policy expert guidance, improving diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths due to purely on-policy learning.

Method: Proposes MedEyes, integrating expert visual search trajectories and Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) for systematic abnormality localization. Uses Confidence Value Sampler (CVS) for balanced exploration and dual-stream GRPO optimization.

Result: Achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5% across medical VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedEyes validates potential for interpretable medical AI by aligning reasoning with clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate medical diagnosis often involves progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning, characteristics commonly observed in clinical workflows. While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems.

*Zhenxiang Lin,Maryam Haghighat,Will Browne,Dimity Miller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for estimating uncertainty in VLMs like CLIP detects misclassifications by measuring visual feature consistency within classes using probabilistic embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often misclassify with high confidence, limiting reliability in safety-critical applications. This work aims to address this issue without requiring training.

Method: Utilizes feature projection and multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings, measuring visual feature consistency for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Shows state-of-the-art error detection on datasets like ImageNet, outperforming baselines without fine-tuning or large training data.

Conclusion: The method effectively detects errors in VLMs, is robust to distribution shifts, and works with minimal training data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained popularity for their strong open vocabulary classification performance, but they are prone to assigning high confidence scores to misclassifications, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

Conclusion: The findings encourage renewed interest in direct audio grounding for more efficient and robust multimodal understanding systems.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions is essential for enabling smooth human-robot interaction. In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

*Shuchen Du,Shuo Lei,Feiran Li,Jiacheng Li,Daisuke Iso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple UDA method uses frequency-domain style adaptation for DAOD tasks, requiring no extra inference overhead and achieving strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods are complex and rely on adversarial training or auxiliary models; this work simplifies the approach for practicality.

Method: Proposes lightweight frequency-domain style adaptation preprocessing during training, discarded at inference.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains on DAOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method is effective, practical, and avoids additional computational costs.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) greatly facilitates the deployment of neural networks across diverse environments. However, most state-of-the-art approaches are overly complex, relying on challenging adversarial training strategies, or on elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models for feature distillation and pseudo-label generation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective UDA method that learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains. The proposed approach introduces only a lightweight pre-processing module during training and entirely discards it at inference time, thus incurring no additional computational overhead. We validate our method on domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD) tasks, where ground-truth annotations are easily accessible in source domains (e.g., normal-weather or synthetic conditions) but challenging to obtain in target domains (e.g., adverse weather or low-light scenes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains on multiple benchmarks, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

*Jiayuan Du,Yiming Zhao,Zhenglong Guo,Yong Pan,Wenbo Hou,Zhihui Hao,Kun Zhan,Qijun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel end-to-end architecture for 3D scene occupancy forecasting using raw image features, avoiding limitations of VAEs and BEV projections, and achieves top performance on nuScenes benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on VAEs for discrete occupancy tokens or BEV projections, limiting representational capacity and geometric priors. The proposed approach aims to overcome these constraints.

Method: The method uses a transformer architecture with sparse occupancy representation, directly processing raw image features to capture spatiotemporal dependencies without BEV projections.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting and shows robust understanding of scene dynamics.

Conclusion: The novel architecture effectively bypasses limitations of prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results and demonstrating strong performance under trajectory conditioning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for trajectory-conditioned forecasting of future 3D scene occupancy. In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

### [19] [ICM-SR: Image-Conditioned Manifold Regularization for Image Super-Resoultion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22048)
*Junoh Kang,Donghun Ryu,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Image-Conditioned Manifold Regularization (ICM) to improve Real-ISR by aligning the regularization manifold with structural image information, addressing limitations of text-conditioned methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods rely on text-conditioned manifolds, which misalign with the task and produce flawed outputs like color distortions and blurred edges.

Method: Proposes ICM, which regularizes outputs using sparse structural information (colormap and Canny edges) instead of raw images or text.

Result: ICM enhances super-resolution performance, especially perceptual quality, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ICM offers a stable, task-aligned regularization approach for Real-ISR, improving output quality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Real world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) often leverages the powerful generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models by regularizing the output to lie on their learned manifold. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications. We will release the source code of our work for reproducibility.

*Jing-Yi Shi,Ming-Fei Li,Ling-An Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TPCNet, a novel low-light image enhancement method that incorporates triple physical constraints derived from the Kubelka-Munk theory to improve performance by addressing specular reflection and reformulating constraints in feature space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retinex-based methods overlook specular reflection and impose constraints in image space, limiting generalization. The authors aim to enhance accuracy by preserving specular reflection and reformulating constraints using Kubelka-Munk theory.

Method: The authors introduce triple physical constraints (TPCs) based on Kubelka-Munk theory, integrating them into feature space to build TPCNet. This avoids new parameters while improving illumination, reflection, and detection modeling.

Result: TPCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets, showing superior quantitative metrics and visual quality. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed constraints.

Conclusion: The TPCNet framework, leveraging Kubelka-Munk theory and feature-space constraints, advances low-light image enhancement by addressing specular reflection and improving generalization without additional parameters.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Conclusion: Promotes intelligent dentistry; code, benchmark, and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA) for Online Handwriting Generation (OHG), addressing unseen characters and writer styles by decomposing content and learning stroke attributes for realistic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OHG methods fail to generate unseen characters, especially in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting practical use.

Method: Proposes DNA, combining adaptive style and content branches to learn stroke attributes and decompose character content into structural and texture details.

Result: DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic handwriting for unseen characters and styles.

Conclusion: DNA effectively addresses the unseen OHG setting, offering improved generalization and realism.

Abstract: Online handwriting generation (OHG) enhances handwriting recognition models by synthesizing diverse, human-like samples. However, existing OHG methods struggle to generate unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we introduce our method for OHG, where the writer's style and the characters generated during testing are unseen during training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA), which comprises an adaptive style branch and an adaptive content branch. The style branch learns stroke attributes such as writing direction, spacing, placement, and flow to generate realistic handwriting. Meanwhile, the content branch is designed to generalize effectively to unseen characters by decomposing character content into structural information and texture details, extracted via local and global encoders, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DNA model is well-suited for the unseen OHG setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Result: Experiments show WorldWander excels in perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization.

Conclusion: WorldWander sets a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in realism and controllability. However, achieving seamless video translation across different perspectives, such as first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric), remains underexplored. Bridging these perspectives is crucial for filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models. Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization. To further support our task, we curate EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset containing synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning method using supervised contrastive learning and RNC loss for MRI-based brain age estimation, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating potential clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI-based brain age estimation is valuable for detecting accelerated brain aging due to neurodegenerative diseases, but existing methods often fail to capture continuous neuromorphological changes.

Method: The study uses supervised contrastive learning with RNC loss and Grad-RAM for visual explanations, applied to T1w structural MRI data.

Result: The method achieved an MAE of 4.27 years and R² of 0.93, outperforming conventional regression and competing with state-of-the-art methods. Grad-RAM revealed nuanced age-related features.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders, with demonstrated correlations between brain age gaps and disease severity in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients.

Abstract: MRI-based brain age estimation models aim to assess a subject's biological brain age based on information, such as neuroanatomical features. Various factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, can accelerate brain aging and measuring this phenomena could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. While deep learning (DL)-based regression has recently attracted major attention, existing approaches often fail to capture the continuous nature of neuromorphological changes, potentially resulting in sub-optimal feature representation and results. To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous dense fusion networks struggle with modality heterogeneity and complexity, leading to suboptimal performance in multi-modal 3D understanding.

Method: Proposes MoE3D with specialized expert networks, MoE-based transformer, information aggregation module, top-1 gating, and progressive pre-training strategy.

Result: Achieves competitive performance; surpasses top counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer.

Conclusion: MoE3D effectively addresses modality heterogeneity and enhances fusion performance in multi-modal 3D tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D understanding is a fundamental task in computer vision. Previous multi-modal fusion methods typically employ a single, dense fusion network, struggling to handle the significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose MoE3D, which integrates Mixture of Experts (MoE) into the multi-modal learning framework. The core is that we deploy a set of specialized "expert" networks, each adept at processing a specific modality or a mode of cross-modal interaction. Specifically, the MoE-based transformer is designed to better utilize the complementary information hidden in the visual features. Information aggregation module is put forward to further enhance the fusion performance. Top-1 gating is employed to make one expert process features with expert groups, ensuring high efficiency. We further propose a progressive pre-training strategy to better leverage the semantic and 2D prior, thus equipping the network with good initialization. Our MoE3D achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks. Notably, our MoE3D surpasses the top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer.

TL;DR: HyperST proposes a hierarchical framework in hyperbolic space to improve spatial transcriptomics prediction by aligning multi-level image-gene representations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack hierarchical alignment of ST data, especially gene expression, and fail to bridge the modality gap between histology images and molecular profiles.

Method: HyperST uses Multi-Level Representation Extractors and Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment to model data hierarchy and align image-gene representations.

Result: HyperST outperforms existing methods on four public datasets, enhancing cross-modal prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: HyperST enables scalable and accurate ST prediction by leveraging hierarchical structures in hyperbolic space.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) merges the benefits of pathology images and gene expression, linking molecular profiles with tissue structure to analyze spot-level function comprehensively. Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMPTMINER is a novel black-box framework for prompt stealing attacks, using reinforcement learning and fuzzing-driven search to recover textual prompts from images, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising value of well-crafted prompts exposes them to security risks like unauthorized extraction. Existing methods lack practicality, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: PROMPTMINER decouples prompt stealing into two phases: RL-based optimization for subjects and fuzzing-driven search for stylistic modifiers.

Result: Achieves CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and SBERT alignment up to 0.751, surpassing baselines. Performs well on in-the-wild images and under defensive perturbations.

Conclusion: PROMPTMINER offers a practical, adaptable, and robust solution for prompt stealing, with potential applications in data attribution and watermarking validation.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX can synthesize realistic, high-quality images directly from textual prompts. The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization. Finally, PROMPTMINER maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations, highlighting remarkable robustness. Code: https://github.com/aaFrostnova/PromptMiner

TL;DR: GoPrune is an accelerated structured pruning method using the ℓ2,p-norm and PAM optimization, achieving efficient network compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs face high storage and computational costs on edge devices, and existing pruning methods are inefficient.

Method: Proposes GoPrune with ℓ2,p-norm for sparse learning and PAM-based optimization for closed-form solutions.

Result: Superior pruning performance demonstrated on CIFAR datasets with ResNet and VGG models.

Conclusion: GoPrune effectively accelerates structured pruning and improves compression efficiency.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from rapidly increasing storage and computational costs as their depth grows, which severely hinders their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning is a practical approach for network compression, among which structured pruning is the most effective for inference acceleration. Although existing work has applied the $\ell_p$-norm to pruning, it only considers unstructured pruning with $p\in (0, 1)$ and has low computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose an accelerated structured pruning method called GoPrune. Our method employs the $\ell_{2,p}$-norm for sparse network learning, where the value of $p$ is extended to $[0, 1)$. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the proximal alternating minimization (PAM), and the resulting subproblems enjoy closed-form solutions, thus improving compression efficiency. Experiments on the CIFAR datasets using ResNet and VGG models demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in network pruning. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/GoPrune.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cue3D is a framework to quantify how image cues like shading and texture impact 3D generation in models, revealing key dependencies on geometric cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding which monocular cues deep generative models exploit for single-image 3D generation is unclear.

Method: Cue3D systematically perturbs cues (shading, texture, etc.) in seven state-of-the-art models to measure their influence.

Result: Shape meaningfulness and shading are critical cues; models over-rely on silhouettes and vary in sensitivity to others.

Conclusion: Cue3D enhances understanding of cue usage in 3D generation, guiding future robust and transparent model development.

Abstract: Humans and traditional computer vision methods rely on a diverse set of monocular cues to infer 3D structure from a single image, such as shading, texture, silhouette, etc. While recent deep generative models have dramatically advanced single-image 3D generation, it remains unclear which image cues these methods actually exploit. We introduce Cue3D, the first comprehensive, model-agnostic framework for quantifying the influence of individual image cues in single-image 3D generation. Our unified benchmark evaluates seven state-of-the-art methods, spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms. By systematically perturbing cues such as shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, and local continuity, we measure their impact on 3D output quality. Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families. By dissecting these dependencies, Cue3D advances our understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues, and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a coupling prompt learning framework to enhance generalization in Vision-Language Models for video tasks, addressing semantic space narrowing by introducing externally supervised prompts and generic attribute anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the forgetting effect and semantic space narrowing in VLMs during fine-tuning on video tasks, while maintaining generalization to unseen classes.

Method: Introduces externally supervised prompts (pre-trained prompts from other datasets) coupled with soft prompts via a learnable mapping layer, along with irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods in generalization benchmarks, especially for base-to-new class prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively preserves generalization ability in VLMs for video tasks by preventing semantic space overfitting and maintaining generic relevance.

Abstract: Visual and textual soft prompt tuning can effectively improve the adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a virtual inking network (VIN) to autonomously identify surgical margins on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on physical inks and standardizing pathology reviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing resection margins rely on physical inking, which is inconsistent and can be obscured by cautery artifacts, impacting patient outcomes.

Method: VIN uses a frozen foundation model as a feature extractor and a compact multilayer perceptron for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. Training involved 120 H&E-stained slides from 12 tonsil tissue blocks (~2 TB data), annotated by a pathologist.

Result: In blind testing on 20 unseen slides, VIN achieved ~73.3% region-level accuracy, producing coherent margin overlays aligned with expert annotations. Errors were confined to limited areas.

Conclusion: VIN effectively captures cautery-related histomorphology, offering reproducible, ink-free margin delineation for digital pathology workflows and margin distance measurement.

Abstract: Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.

TL;DR: DualVLA addresses action degeneration in VLAs by using dual-layer data pruning and dual-teacher adaptive distillation, achieving balanced performance in action and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the issue of action degeneration in generalist VLAs, which lose action performance while gaining reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes DualVLA with dual-layer data pruning and dual-teacher adaptive distillation. Introduces VLA Score for evaluation.

Result: Achieves 61.0% success rate in SimplerEnv and 65.4 score across benchmarks, balancing action and reasoning.

Conclusion: DualVLA effectively mitigates action degeneration while maintaining reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: To build a generalizable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with strong reasoning ability, a common strategy is to first train a specialist VLA on robot demonstrations to acquire reliable manipulation skills, and then incorporate mixed annotated robot data together with multimodal data to restore broader reasoning capabilities. However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

*Yanchao Zhao,Jihao Zhu,Yu Liu,Weizhuo Chen,Yuling Yang,Kun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASL enhances sign language generation by integrating multi-emotion features, improving expressiveness and pose accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based sign language generation lacks emotional expressiveness, limiting naturalness for the Deaf community.

Method: EASL uses emotion-semantic disentanglement modules and progressive training to extract features. Emotional representations guide pose decoding for expressive outputs.

Result: EASL outperforms baselines in pose accuracy and enables emotion recognition with 7-class confidence scores.

Conclusion: EASL successfully integrates emotions into sign language generation, producing more natural and expressive videos.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized sign language generation by automatically transforming text into high-quality sign language videos, providing accessible communication for the Deaf community. However, existing LLM-based approaches prioritize semantic accuracy while overlooking emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness. We propose EASL (Emotion-Aware Sign Language), a multi-emotion-guided generation architecture for fine-grained emotional integration. We introduce emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, the emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that EASL achieves pose accuracy superior to all compared baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions, outperforming existing methods by 1.47% to 8.80% in mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current camera-based perception models in autonomous driving struggle with diverse weather conditions, focusing too narrowly on weather removal rather than adaptability.

Method: The proposed architecture includes a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) with a U-shaped net for image refinement and a Detection Unit (DTU) using a modified YOLO network for object detection, both leveraging semantics.

Result: The method improves object detection performance by 1.47% to 8.80% in mAP across various weather benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Semantic information significantly enhances image transformation and object detection in diverse weather, offering a more adaptable and comprehensive approach.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, camera-based perception models are mostly trained on clear weather data. Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\% to 8.80\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather. This highlights the potency of semantics in image enhancement and object detection, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance.

### [35] [Stacked Ensemble of Fine-Tuned CNNs for Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22143)
*Adarsh Gupta,Japleen Kaur,Tanvi Doshi,Teena Sharma,Nishchal K. Verma,Shantaram Vasikarla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A stacked ensemble model using fine-tuned CNNs (MobileNetV2, YOLOv8, DenseNet201) with CatBoost as meta-learner improves KOA severity grading accuracy (73% multiclass, 87.5% binary), outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KOA severity grading via X-ray and KL system is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors, necessitating automated, accurate solutions.

Method: Developed a stacked ensemble model combining diverse pre-trained CNNs (MobileNetV2, YOLOv8, DenseNet201) as base learners and CatBoost as meta-learner for binary and multiclass KOA classification.

Result: Achieved 73% balanced accuracy in multiclass KL grading and 87.5% in binary KOA detection, surpassing prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ensemble model offers a more reliable, automated alternative to manual KOA severity assessment, reducing subjectivity and improving diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.

Result: The framework successfully defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks, achieving top performance in safety and utility.

Conclusion: RemedyGS provides an effective solution to secure 3DGS systems against computation cost attacks, ensuring reliable deployment.

Abstract: As a mainstream technique for 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has been applied in a wide range of applications and services. Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS. In this paper, we propose the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework, named RemedyGS, against such computation cost attacks, safeguarding 3DGS reconstruction systems and services. Our pipeline comprises two key components: a detector to identify the attacked input images with poisoned textures and a purifier to recover the benign images from their attacked counterparts, mitigating the adverse effects of these attacks. Moreover, we incorporate adversarial training into the purifier to enforce distributional alignment between the recovered and original natural images, thereby enhancing the defense efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks in 3DGS systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both safety and utility.

*Bo Chen,Tao Liu,Qi Chen,Xie Chen,Zilong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMTalker introduces an implicit motion transfer framework using cross-attention for high-fidelity talking face generation, avoiding identity drift and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, leading to inadequate global motion modeling and identity drift.

Method: IMTalker uses a cross-attention mechanism for implicit motion transfer and introduces an identity-adaptive module for disentanglement. A lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues.

Result: IMTalker outperforms prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip sync, achieving 40-42 FPS on an RTX 4090 GPU.

Conclusion: IMTalker delivers state-of-the-art talking face generation with superior efficiency and quality, promising broad applications.

Abstract: Talking face generation aims to synthesize realistic speaking portraits from a single image, yet existing methods often rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift. We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU. We will release our code and pre-trained models to facilitate applications and future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework (GRPO) for accurate and reliable long-term PM forecasting in East Asia, using a high-resolution dataset and addressing operational cost mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PM forecasting is crucial for public health, especially in regions like East Asia with complex terrain and dynamics. Existing models lack regional specificity and real-time adaptability.

Method: Developed the CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia and introduced GRPO with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align forecasts with operational priorities.

Result: Reduced regional forecast error by 59.5% and False Alarm Rate by 47.3%, maintaining competitive F1-scores.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves forecast reliability and practicality for air quality systems.

Abstract: Accurate long horizon forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentration fields is essential for operational public health decisions. However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.

TL;DR: PS-CBM improves interpretability and accuracy in Concept Bottleneck Models by addressing visual grounding, redundancy, and metric balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBMs automate concept generation but suffer from poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and lack of principled metrics for balancing accuracy and compactness.

Method: PS-CBM proposes a multimodal concept generator, a Partially Shared Concept Strategy, and Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA) metric.

Result: PS-CBM outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5% with fewer concepts.

Conclusion: PS-CBM effectively balances high accuracy and strong interpretability.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by introducing a layer of human-understandable concepts between inputs and predictions. While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.

*Pu Li,Wenhao Zhang,Weize Quan,Biao Zhang,Peter Wonka,Dong-Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepGPT introduces a single-stage autoregressive framework using Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation for efficient and unified B-rep generation, outperforming multi-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and error accumulation in existing multi-stage generative methods for B-rep CAD models.

Method: Uses VHP representation to unify geometry and topology, encodes them into tokens with dual VQ-VAEs, and employs a decoder-only Transformer for autoregressive prediction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in B-rep generation and supports versatile applications like conditional generation and autocompletion.

Conclusion: BrepGPT offers a more efficient and unified approach to B-rep generation, with broad applicability in CAD design.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) is the de facto standard for CAD model representation in modern industrial design. The intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements in B-rep structures has forced existing generative methods to rely on cascaded multi-stage networks, resulting in error accumulation and computational inefficiency. We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation. The framework also exhibits versatility in various applications, including conditional generation from category labels, point clouds, text descriptions, and images, as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation.

*Zhaoyang Wei,Wenchao Ding,Yanchao Hao,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRiP introduces a two-stage training framework combining guided perceptual focus and logical reasoning to improve multimodal AI's visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods suffer from instability (RL) or rigidity (SFT), limiting models' adaptability in complex visual tasks.

Method: GRiP uses cognitive-enhanced RL with Salience-Weighted IoU Reward and Multi-Heuristic Reward to guide perception and reasoning.

Result: GRiP achieves state-of-the-art performance on TreeBench and V* Bench, outperforming open-source models.

Conclusion: Guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals enhances multimodal reasoning, marking progress in AI capabilities.

Abstract: Models capable of "thinking with images" by dynamically grounding their reasoning in visual evidence represent a major leap in multimodal AI. However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD diagnosis is challenging due to symptom variability and neurological complexity, necessitating early and objective methods.

Method: The model uses a multi-branch architecture for rs-fMRI, sMRI, and phenotypic data, merging them via concatenation. Site-based similarity encodes graph structure, while Chebyshev filters and GAT layers enhance learning and node representations.

Result: The model achieves 74.82% test accuracy and 0.82 AUC, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed GCN model offers a promising approach for accurate ASD diagnosis by leveraging multimodal data and advanced graph techniques.

Abstract: ASD is a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder marked by variation in symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis extremely problematic. This paper presents a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, incorporating Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), to increase the classification accuracy of ASD utilizing multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data. Leveraging the ABIDE I dataset, which contains resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and phenotypic variables from 870 patients, the model leverages a multi-branch architecture that processes each modality individually before merging them via concatenation. Graph structure is encoded using site-based similarity to generate a population graph, which helps in understanding relationship connections across individuals. Chebyshev polynomial filters provide localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, whereas GAT layers increase node representations by attention-weighted aggregation of surrounding information. The proposed model is trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with a total input dimension of 5,206 features per individual. Extensive trials demonstrate the enhanced model's superiority, achieving a test accuracy of 74.82\% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire dataset, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art baselines, including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTR-VP, a vision-based trajectory planning method for autonomous driving, replacing map features with learned visual representations. It evaluates on the Waymo dataset and finds multi-trajectory prediction improves planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve autonomous driving trajectory planning by leveraging visual context embeddings and motion prediction frameworks, reducing reliance on traditional map-based features.

Method: The method uses a ViT encoder to process raw images and kinematic states, producing context embeddings. It replaces MTR's intention queries with cross-attention on intent and context embeddings.

Result: Results show transformer-based visual and kinetic feature combination isn't effective for context embeddings, but predicting multiple future trajectories enhances planning performance.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of multi-trajectory prediction over single trajectories, despite limitations in combining visual and kinetic features.

Abstract: We present a method for trajectory planning for autonomous driving, learning image-based context embeddings that align with motion prediction frameworks and planning-based intention input. Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FECO, a framework for dense foot contact estimation from RGB images, addressing challenges like shoe appearance diversity and monotonous ground features through style-invariant and ground-aware learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foot contact is crucial for understanding human movement, but existing methods simplify it or focus on joints, lacking detailed interaction modeling.

Method: Proposes FECO with shoe style adversarial training for style-invariant features and a ground feature extractor leveraging spatial context.

Result: FECO achieves robust foot contact estimation across diverse shoe styles and effectively utilizes ground information.

Conclusion: The framework advances dense foot contact estimation, addressing generalization and feature extraction challenges.

Abstract: Foot contact plays a critical role in human interaction with the world, and thus exploring foot contact can advance our understanding of human movement and physical interaction. Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released.

TL;DR: ARPGNet improves facial expression recognition by combining appearance and relation-aware spatial-temporal representations using parallel graph attention fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on facial appearance via CNNs but ignore facial region relationships, limiting discriminative power.

Method: ARPGNet uses facial region relation graphs with graph attention to model relationships and fuses them with CNN-based appearance sequences in a parallel module.

Result: ARPGNet outperforms or matches state-of-the-art on three datasets.

Conclusion: Combining appearance and relation-aware representations enhances facial expression recognition.

Abstract: The key to facial expression recognition is to learn discriminative spatial-temporal representations that embed facial expression dynamics. Previous studies predominantly rely on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn facial appearance representations, overlooking the relationships between facial regions. To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel methods for 3D object generation using diffusion models, eliminating the need for textual inversion and improving control and 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on textual inversion, which is time-consuming and lacks control. The authors aim to address these limitations.

Method: Proposed methods include an off-the-shelf image adapter for better control and a depth-conditioned warmup strategy for enhanced 3D consistency.

Result: Experiments show comparable performance to text-inversion-based methods, with improved 3D consistency validated by a user study.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the limitations of textual inversion, offering better control and 3D consistency.

Abstract: Recently, the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models have been demonstrated, producing images with remarkable fidelity. Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

TL;DR: A training-free diffusion framework improves multi-view consistency in text-based image editing for 3D representations like NeRFs and Gaussian Splat models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing geometric and photometric inconsistencies in multi-view image editing for 3D representations.

Method: Introduces a consistency loss guiding diffusion sampling for coherent edits, applicable to various editing methods and multi-view setups.

Result: Significantly enhances 3D consistency and enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and text fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances multi-view consistency in image editing, supporting diverse applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have greatly improved text-based image editing, yet methods that edit images independently often produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views of the same scene. Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces M3LLM, a medical multi-modal large language model, leveraging compound images from biomedical literature for multi-image analysis, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs are limited to single-image understanding, hindering clinical workflows requiring multi-image synthesis. The lack of annotated data further complicates development.

Method: Proposes a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation framework using license-permissive compound images from biomedical literature. Develops M3LLM and benchmarks it with PMC-MI-Bench.

Result: M3LLM outperforms general-purpose and specialized MLLMs in multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice tasks, showing strong generalization in chest X-ray analysis.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable paradigm for medical MLLMs with composite reasoning, bridging biomedical literature and clinical applications.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in advancing healthcare. However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IE-SRGS is a novel method for reconstructing high-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting models from low-resolution inputs by combining external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with 3D Gaussian ambiguity due to cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps in 2DSR models, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: IE-SRGS integrates external 2DSR priors (HR images and depth maps) with internal multi-scale 3DGS features, using a mask-guided fusion strategy for optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate IE-SRGS's superior performance in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: IE-SRGS effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction by synergizing external and internal knowledge.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from low-resolution (LR) inputs remains challenging due to the lack of fine-grained textures and geometry. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

TL;DR: VessQC is an open-source tool for uncertainty-guided curation of 3D microscopy segmentations, improving error detection recall without increasing curation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual curation remains necessary despite state-of-the-art models due to error-prone results in 3D microscopy segmentation.

Method: VessQC integrates uncertainty maps to guide users toward regions with biologically meaningful errors.

Result: In a user study, error detection recall improved from 67% to 94% (p=0.007) with no significant time increase.

Conclusion: VessQC efficiently bridges uncertainty estimation and human-computer interaction for volumetric segmentation refinement.

Abstract: Accurate 3D microscopy image segmentation is critical for quantitative bioimage analysis but even state-of-the-art foundation models yield error-prone results. Therefore, manual curation is still widely used for either preparing high-quality training data or fixing errors before analysis. We present VessQC, an open-source tool for uncertainty-guided curation of large 3D microscopy segmentations. By integrating uncertainty maps, VessQC directs user attention to regions most likely containing biologically meaningful errors. In a preliminary user study uncertainty-guided correction significantly improved error detection recall from 67% to 94.0% (p=0.007) without a significant increase in total curation time. VessQC thus enables efficient, human-in-the-loop refinement of volumetric segmentations and bridges a key gap in real-world applications between uncertainty estimation and practical human-computer interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a tampering detection method using SAM by transforming images into blank canvases with adversarial perturbations, enhanced by frequency-aware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC-based image editing simplifies realistic image modification but increases forgery risks, necessitating robust detection methods.

Method: Use adversarial perturbations to render SAM blind to original image content, making tampered regions detectable. Frequency-aware optimization improves deception.

Result: Experiments show the method effectively localizes tampered regions due to SAM's perception and the optimization strategy.

Conclusion: The approach successfully leverages SAM's capabilities for tamper detection, offering a novel solution to image forgery risks.

Abstract: AIGC-based image editing technology has greatly simplified the realistic-level image modification, causing serious potential risks of image forgery. This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTSnap improves test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models by pruning low-quality candidates early using noise-aware reward models, saving computation and boosting performance by 16%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for test-time scaling are computationally expensive due to the need to fully denoise each candidate before reward computation, limiting exploration under fixed budgets.

Method: TTSnap introduces noise-aware pruning using self-distilled reward models aligned with clean image rewards, trained via curriculum learning from clean to noisy images.

Result: TTSnap achieves a 16% performance improvement over existing methods and works well with post-training techniques and local optimization.

Conclusion: TTSnap enhances efficiency and effectiveness in test-time scaling by early pruning and noise-aware reward alignment.

Abstract: A prominent approach to test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models formulates the problem as a search over multiple noise seeds, selecting the one that maximizes a certain image-reward function. The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/.

### [54] [Semantic Anchoring for Robust Personalization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22245)
*Seoyun Yang,Gihoon Kim,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic anchoring method to improve personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, balancing subject fidelity and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with personalization, either overfitting to reference images or failing to learn new attributes. The aim is to achieve stable adaptation while preserving semantic alignment.

Method: The authors propose semantic anchoring, grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions to guide adaptation, ensuring stable and controlled learning of rare concepts.

Result: The method improves subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baselines, validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: Semantic anchoring effectively balances personalization and semantic consistency, expanding pretrained distributions while maintaining stability.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality in latent diffusion models due to high-frequency encoding-decoding discrepancies. It proposes FreqWarm, a curriculum-based solution to enhance high-frequency exposure during training, improving generation quality across various autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The persistent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and generation quality in latent diffusion models, especially as latent dimensionality increases, motivates the study. The authors identify high-frequency encoding-decoding disparities as the root cause.

Method: The authors analyze encoder/decoder behaviors through controlled perturbations in RGB and latent domains. They introduce FreqWarm, a frequency warm-up curriculum, to increase early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training.

Result: FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality across multiple high-dimensional autoencoders, reducing gFID scores significantly (e.g., 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that managing frequency exposure can enhance diffusibility in high-dimensional latent spaces, offering a plug-and-play solution compatible with diverse backbones.

Abstract: Latent diffusion has become the default paradigm for visual generation, yet we observe a persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off as latent dimensionality increases: higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but generation quality eventually declines. We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones. Our study shows that explicitly managing frequency exposure can successfully turn high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets.

TL;DR: UMind-VL is a unified medical foundation model bridging ultrasound perception and interpretation, outperforming existing models in segmentation, detection, and diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution integrating low-level perception (e.g., segmentation) with high-level interpretation (e.g., diagnosis).

Method: UMind-VL uses a large-scale dataset (UMind-DS) and a dynamic convolutional mask decoder conditioned on LLM outputs to unify tasks like segmentation and diagnosis.

Result: UMind-VL outperforms generalist models and matches/surpasses specialist models in segmentation, detection, and diagnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: UMind-VL successfully bridges ultrasound perception and interpretation, demonstrating strong performance and generalization.

Abstract: Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.

TL;DR: This paper explores vulnerabilities in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) watermarking and introduces GSPure, a framework designed to purify watermarks while preserving scene fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS watermarking methods lack robust protection, prompting the need for a specialized solution to address vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors propose GSPure, which analyzes view-dependent rendering and uses geometrically accurate feature clustering to isolate and remove watermarks.

Result: GSPure reduces watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB with minimal impact on scene fidelity (<1dB loss), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: GSPure is the first effective watermark purification framework for 3DGS, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for 3D scenes, widely adopted due to its exceptional efficiency and high-fidelity visual quality. Given the significant value of 3DGS assets, recent works have introduced specialized watermarking schemes to ensure copyright protection and ownership verification. However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVGGT improves upon VGGT for autonomous driving by incorporating AD-specific priors like minimal camera overlap and known intrinsics/extrinsics, introducing temporal and multi-camera attention modules, and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT's direct application to autonomous driving systems is suboptimal due to differing priors. AD systems require handling minimal camera overlap, known intrinsics/extrinsics, and fixed relative camera positions during motion.

Method: Proposes DriveVGGT with Temporal Video Attention (TVA) for single-camera spatiotemporal continuity and Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) for cross-camera consistency. Extends VGGT heads with absolute scale and ego pose heads.

Result: DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, and fastVGGT on AD datasets, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its designs.

Conclusion: DriveVGGT successfully integrates AD-specific priors into feed-forward reconstruction, offering superior performance for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Feed-forward reconstruction has recently gained significant attention, with VGGT being a notable example. However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head. Experiments show that DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, fastVGGT on autonomous driving dataset while extensive ablation studies verify effectiveness of the proposed designs.

*Wei Guo,Shunqi Mao,Zhuonan Liang,Heng Wang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'patch collapse,' a concept where observing certain image patches reduces uncertainty in others, akin to quantum mechanics. It proposes an autoencoder to identify patch dependencies and shows benefits in image generation and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and leverage dependencies between image patches ('patch collapse') to improve vision efficiency, drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics.

Method: An autoencoder is trained to softly select patches for reconstructing target patches, and PageRank scores are used to determine the optimal patch order.

Result: Applying this order enhances autoregressive image generation (MAR model) and enables high classification accuracy with only 22% of patches (Vision Transformers).

Conclusion: Patch collapse offers a novel perspective for efficient image modeling, evidenced by improved performance in generation and classification tasks.

Abstract: Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

TL;DR: Match-and-Fuse is a zero-shot, training-free method for consistent controlled generation of image sets, preserving cross-image consistency without masks or manual supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on individual images or videos, lacking a solution for generating consistent sets of unstructured images with shared visual elements.

Method: The task is modeled as a graph where nodes represent images and edges trigger joint generation of pairs, leveraging dense correspondences and feature fusion for consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, enabling new content creation capabilities from image collections.

Conclusion: Match-and-Fuse provides a unified, scalable solution for consistent set-to-set generation, advancing controlled image synthesis.

Abstract: We present Match-and-Fuse - a zero-shot, training-free method for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets - collections that share a common visual element, yet differ in viewpoint, time of capture, and surrounding content. Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

TL;DR: MVMAE and MVMAE-V2T are self-supervised frameworks for learning robust medical representations by leveraging multi-view radiology data and text reports, outperforming baselines in disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build robust medical ML systems by exploiting intrinsic clinical data structure via self-supervised pretraining.

Method: MVMAE uses masked image reconstruction and cross-view alignment; MVMAE-V2T adds text reports for semantic grounding.

Result: MVMAE outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines; MVMAE-V2T excels in low-label regimes.

Conclusion: Structural and textual supervision are complementary for scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

Abstract: Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Swin Transformer-based neck design for detecting small, sparse objects like birds, improving feature learning by adapting window sizes in the transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection is challenging due to size, blur, and occlusion. Existing methods focus on dense scenarios, leaving sparse objects like birds underaddressed.

Method: The authors enhance feature learning in the neck sub-network using Swin Transformer with hierarchical design and adjusted window sizes for small objects.

Result: Experiments show the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck with CenterNet improves performance, especially with smaller window sizes (default 2).

Conclusion: Adapting Swin Transformer window sizes enhances small object detection, proving effective for sparse targets like birds.

Abstract: Object detection is the task of detecting objects in an image. In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.

*Silvia Dani,Tiberio Uricchio,Lorenzo Seidenari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel automated video colorization method using language-conditioned diffusion and semantic guidance achieves state-of-the-art results with temporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video colorization methods face issues like temporal flickering or require heavy manual effort, prompting the need for an automated, high-fidelity solution.

Method: The approach uses a language-conditioned diffusion model guided by object masks and textual prompts (generic or specific). Temporal stability is ensured via optical flow (RAFT) warping and inconsistency correction.

Result: The method excels in benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20), outperforming others in PSNR, Colorfulness, and CDC metrics.

Conclusion: Automated prompt-based guidance effectively enables consistent, high-quality video colorization without manual input.

Abstract: Existing video colorization methods struggle with temporal flickering or demand extensive manual input. We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.

*Fabio Rosenthal,Sebastian Schmidt,Thorsten Graf,Thorsten Bagodonat,Stephan Günnemann,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLM evaluations are highly sensitive to minor, semantically neutral prompt format changes, revealing unexplored biases beyond answer choice order. Existing mitigation strategies fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and analyze unexplored biases in prompt formatting affecting MLLM evaluations, questioning their reliability.

Method: Conducted a large-scale study with seven MLLMs and five VQA datasets, testing 48 prompt format variations.

Result: Multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to prompt changes, biases persist beyond known order biases or model confidence.

Conclusion: Current MLLM evaluations are unreliable due to unexplored prompt biases; existing mitigation strategies are ineffective.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in handling image-text inputs. A common way to assess this ability is through multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA). Earlier works have already revealed that these benchmarks are sensitive to answer choice order, a limitation that can be mitigated through careful design. Yet, we highlight additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations. Specifically, we identify three key variation factors in prompt formatting and analyze their impact through a large-scale study involving $\mathbf{\text{seven}}$ MLLMs and $\mathbf{\text{five}}$ VQA datasets, spanning $\mathbf{48}$ distinct $\mathbf{\text{prompt format variations}}$. Our findings reveal that multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes, even when these changes are semantically neutral. We further demonstrate that these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer. Finally, we demonstrate that existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

*Yang Chen,Xiaowei Xu,Shuai Wang,Chenhui Zhu,Ruxue Wen,Xubin Li,Tiezheng Ge,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel alignment strategy for Normalizing Flows (NFs) that improves generative quality by aligning intermediate features with a vision foundation model, achieving faster training and better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard NFs suffer from poor semantic representations due to log-likelihood optimization. The paper aims to enhance NFs by leveraging their invertibility for better alignment.

Method: Proposes aligning intermediate features of the generative pass with representations from a vision foundation model and introduces a training-free, test-time optimization algorithm.

Result: The approach accelerates NF training by over 3.3× and improves generative quality and classification accuracy, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The alignment strategy effectively enhances NFs, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are a class of generative models distinguished by a mathematically invertible architecture, where the forward pass transforms data into a latent space for density estimation, and the reverse pass generates new samples from this space. This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/FlowBack.

*Anshul Bagaria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSIGHT is a multimodal framework for detecting and explaining AI-generated images, improving robustness and transparency even at low resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current deepfake detection systems, which degrade under real-world conditions and lack interpretability.

Method: Hierarchical super-resolution, Grad-CAM-driven localization, CLIP-guided semantic alignment, and a vision-language model with structured prompting for explanations.

Result: INSIGHT outperforms prior detectors and baselines in robustness and explanation quality across diverse domains under extreme degradation.

Conclusion: INSIGHT advances transparent and reliable AI-generated image forensics, offering trustworthy content verification.

Abstract: The growing realism of AI-generated images produced by recent GAN and diffusion models has intensified concerns over the reliability of visual media. Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality.
  Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.

*Zhenglin Zhou,Fan Ma,Chengzhuo Gui,Xiaobo Xia,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchorFlow enhances training-free 3D editing by ensuring latent anchor consistency, improving semantic fidelity and geometric stability without mask supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to produce stable or strong 3D edits due to inconsistent latent anchors caused by noise during diffusion sampling.

Method: AnchorFlow uses a global latent anchor shared between source and target trajectories, enforcing coherence with a relaxed anchor-alignment loss and anchor-aligned update rule.

Result: Experiments show AnchorFlow achieves semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse types.

Conclusion: AnchorFlow stabilizes latent reference space, enabling pronounced semantic modifications while preserving geometric fidelity.

Abstract: Training-free 3D editing aims to modify 3D shapes based on human instructions without model finetuning. It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RS-EoT, a method addressing pseudo reasoning in remote sensing tasks by promoting evidence-based reasoning through iterative visual inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from observed pseudo reasoning in vision-language systems for remote sensing, where models narrate reasoning without genuine visual evidence.

Method: The method proposes RS-EoT, a language-driven iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm, implemented via SocraticAgent (self-play multi-agent system) and a two-stage RL strategy.

Result: RS-EoT achieves SOTA performance on RS VQA benchmarks and shows iterative reasoning cycles, confirming mitigation of the Glance Effect.

Conclusion: RS-EoT successfully enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning in remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Recent multimodal reasoning models, inspired by DeepSeek-R1, have significantly advanced vision-language systems. However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV-MM3D is a synthetic dataset designed for UAV perception with 400K frames, diverse scenarios, and multimodal annotations, addressing challenges in real-world data collection and annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in real-world UAV data collection (e.g., airspace regulations, privacy) and costly manual annotations.

Method: Created UAV-MM3D, a synthetic dataset with synchronized frames across diverse environments and weather, featuring five modalities. Proposed LGFusionNet for multimodal fusion.

Result: Provides 2D/3D annotations for UAV tasks like detection, pose estimation, tracking, and trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: UAV-MM3D serves as a benchmark for advancing UAV perception, offering controlled, comprehensive, and annotated synthetic data.

Abstract: Accurate perception of UAVs in complex low-altitude environments is critical for airspace security and related intelligent systems. Developing reliable solutions requires large-scale, accurately annotated, and multimodal data. However, real-world UAV data collection faces inherent constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce UAV-MM3D, a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset for low-altitude UAV perception and motion understanding. It comprises 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban areas, suburbs, forests, coastal regions) and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, foggy), featuring multiple UAV models (micro, small, medium-sized) and five modalities - RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, and DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor). Each frame provides 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core tasks related to UAVs such as 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and short-term trajectory forecasting. We further propose LGFusionNet, a LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline, and a dedicated UAV trajectory prediction baseline to facilitate benchmarking. With its controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations, UAV3D offers a public benchmark for advancing 3D perception of UAVs.

TL;DR: DiffStyle360 is a diffusion-based framework for multi-view consistent 3D head stylization without per-style training, using a single reference image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require costly optimization or style-specific fine-tuning, limiting adaptability across artistic domains.

Method: Introduces Style Appearance Module and Style Fusion Attention, uses 3D GAN-generated data, and employs temperature-based key scaling for intensity control.

Result: Outperforms GAN- and diffusion-based methods in style quality on FFHQ and RenderMe360 datasets.

Conclusion: DiffStyle360 efficiently achieves high-quality, identity-preserving stylization across diverse styles.

Abstract: 3D head stylization has emerged as a key technique for reimagining realistic human heads in various artistic forms, enabling expressive character design and creative visual experiences in digital media. Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference. Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 demonstrate that DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based stylization methods across challenging style domains.

*Minghao Yin,Yukang Cao,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WUKONG is a training-free framework for high-fidelity 3D morphing using prompts, outperforming conventional methods by leveraging generative priors and optimal transport for smooth transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D morphing methods require manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation, which limit generalization and need costly preprocessing. WUKONG aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: WUKONG uses flow-based transformers for 3D transitions, formulates morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem, and employs sequential initialization and similarity-guided semantic consistency for smooth and faithful results.

Result: WUKONG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior high-fidelity transitions with rich texture details across diverse geometry and texture variations.

Conclusion: WUKONG presents a robust, efficient, and high-quality solution for 3D morphing, eliminating the need for manual preprocessing and ensuring smooth transitions with preserved semantic fidelity.

Abstract: We present WUKONG, a novel training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that takes a pair of source and target prompts (image or text) as input. Unlike conventional methods -- which rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation (limiting generalization and requiring costly preprocessing) -- WUKONG leverages the generative prior of flow-based transformers to produce high-fidelity 3D transitions with rich texture details. To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence. For faithful texture preservation, we propose a similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanism that selectively retains high-frequency details and enables precise control over blending dynamics. This avoids common artifacts like oversmoothing while maintaining semantic fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations.

*Weining Ren,Hongjun Wang,Xiao Tan,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fin3R introduces a lightweight fine-tuning method for 3D reconstruction models, improving geometric accuracy without increasing computational costs during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to limited high-fidelity supervision and geometric misalignment from multi-view regression.

Method: Fin3R freezes the decoder and fine-tunes the encoder using a monocular teacher model's distilled geometric details, facilitated by a lightweight LoRA adapter.

Result: Fine-tuned models show sharper boundaries, better recovery of complex structures, and higher geometric accuracy in single- and multi-view settings, with negligible impact on memory or latency.

Conclusion: Fin3R provides an effective, general solution for enhancing 3D reconstruction models without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: We present Fin3R, a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method for feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

TL;DR: SkeletonAgent improves skeleton-based action recognition by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with cooperative agents (Questioner and Selector) for targeted guidance and finer-grained cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on LLMs without performance feedback, often missing discriminative cues needed to distinguish similar actions.

Method: Proposes SkeletonAgent, a framework with Questioner and Selector agents. Questioner identifies confused classes for LLM context, and Selector extracts joint-level constraints from LLM responses.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human.

Conclusion: SkeletonAgent effectively bridges LLMs and recognition models, enhancing discriminative capabilities for skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition increasingly leverage semantic priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich skeletal representations. However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

TL;DR: ABounD is a novel adversarial boundary-driven framework for few-shot multi-class anomaly detection, integrating semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot anomaly detection faces challenges due to data scarcity and blurred boundaries between normal and abnormal states, leading to missed defects and false rejections.

Method: ABounD combines Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) for class-adaptive prompts and Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) for precise margins using PGD-style perturbations, trained under Concept-Boundary Loss.

Result: ABounD achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets for few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The unified learning framework of ABounD effectively addresses the challenges of few-shot anomaly detection by enhancing semantic alignment and boundary precision.

Abstract: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection remains a challenging task. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

Motivation: Addressing misuse of deepfake technology by developing robust detection methods to identify manipulated media.

Method: Leverages pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features to extract temporal characteristics from videos, enabling segregation of real and fake content. Focuses on zero-shot detection for generalizability.

Result: FauxNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot detection and can distinguish between different deepfake generation techniques. Evaluated on new Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++.

Conclusion: FauxNet demonstrates superior performance in deepfake detection and attribution. The Authentica datasets provide valuable resources for future research.

Abstract: Deepfake generation has witnessed remarkable progress, contributing to highly realistic generated images, videos, and audio. While technically intriguing, such progress has raised serious concerns related to the misuse of manipulated media. To mitigate such misuse, robust and reliable deepfake detection is urgently needed. Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques. We provide extensive analysis and results on the Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, demonstrating the superiority of FauxNet. The Authentica datasets will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable quantum processors require reliable tuning strategies, particularly accurate state identification from charge-stability diagrams.

Method: Evaluated four ML architectures (U-Nets, ViTs, MDNs, CNNs) using synthetic and experimental CSDs, varying data budgets and normalization schemes.

Result: CNNs balance performance and efficiency, outperforming U-Nets/ViTs on experimental data; normalization impacts stability and accuracy.

Conclusion: CNNs with min-max normalization are practical for QD CSDs, offering strong accuracy with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.

Result: Proposes a streamlined model capable of differentiating a wide range of intent-categories.

Conclusion: IntentHQ shifts focus from authenticity verification to contextual understanding, addressing deeper motivations behind manipulated videos.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to increasingly realistic deepfake videos, posing significant societal and security risks. While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos. Our proposed model is streamlined to differentiate between a wide range of intent-categories.

TL;DR: ITS3D improves text-guided 3D diffusion models by optimizing Gaussian noise inputs via verifier-guided search, enhancing stability, efficiency, and exploration without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To boost generative quality in 3D diffusion models at inference time without requiring additional training.

Method: Introduces ITS3D, featuring Gaussian normalization, SVD-based compression, and singular space reset for refining noise inputs iteratively.

Result: Demonstrates enhanced text-to-3D generation quality efficiently.

Conclusion: ITS3D showcases the potential of search-based methods for improving generative processes computationally efficiently.

Abstract: We explore inference-time scaling in text-guided 3D diffusion models to enhance generative quality without additional training. To this end, we introduce ITS3D, a framework that formulates the task as an optimization problem to identify the most effective Gaussian noise input. The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

*Jakob Nazarenus,Dominik Michels,Wojtek Palubicki,Simin Kou,Fang-Lue Zhang,Soren Pirk,Reinhard Koch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reconstruct dynamic fire in 3D from limited camera views using Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation, addressing challenges like volatility and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capturing and reconstructing fire's dynamics is difficult due to its volatile nature, transparency, and high-frequency features. The goal is to achieve this with only three views.

Method: The static background is separated from dynamic fire using multi-view stereo images and monocular depth priors. Fire is initialized as a 3D flow field from dense optical flow projections, with Gaussian encoding for high-frequency features. Hardware synchronization ensures temporal alignment.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative validations show robust performance in diverse and challenging real fire scenarios.

Conclusion: The method successfully reconstructs dynamic fire from limited views, overcoming under-constrained geometry and high-frequency challenges.

Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct dynamic fire in 3D from a limited set of camera views with a Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation. Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware. Our quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios.

TL;DR: RoadSceneBench is a benchmark addressing the gap in mid-level road semantics evaluation, emphasizing relational understanding and structural consistency through HRRP-T framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack focus on reasoning capabilities for road topology and dynamic scene structure, essential for autonomous driving and map construction.

Method: Introduces RoadSceneBench benchmark and HRRP-T framework for VLMs, promoting spatial coherence and semantic alignment in reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse road configurations, enhancing mid-level road semantics understanding.

Conclusion: RoadSceneBench offers a powerful foundation for advancing structure-aware autonomous perception.

Abstract: Understanding mid-level road semantics, which capture the structural and contextual cues that link low-level perception to high-level planning, is essential for reliable autonomous driving and digital map construction. However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fine-grained feature extraction in text-based person anomaly retrieval by combining local and global perspectives and integrating multiple objective loss functions.

Method: LHP module with VLM for fine-grained features, UIT model combining ITC, ITM, MLM, and MIM losses, and an iterative ensemble strategy.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on PAB dataset with 9.70% improvement in R@1, 1.77% in R@5, and 1.01% in R@10.

Conclusion: The proposed LHP and UIT models, along with iterative ensemble and feature selection, significantly enhance retrieval performance.

Abstract: Text-based person anomaly retrieval has emerged as a challenging task, with most existing approaches relying on complex deep-learning techniques. This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PAB dataset, compared with previous work, with a 9.70\% improvement in R@1, 1.77\% improvement in R@5, and 1.01\% improvement in R@10.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods fail on unseen generators due to memorizing generator-specific artifacts. DINOv3 shows strong transferability without fine-tuning, suggesting foundation models can generalize better.

Method: Analyzes DINOv3's reliance on low-frequency structures and introduces a training-free token-ranking strategy with a lightweight linear probe to select authenticity-relevant tokens.

Result: The proposed method improves detection accuracy across datasets, demonstrating foundation models' cross-generator generalization capability.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence for foundation models' generalization in forgery detection and offers a universal, efficient baseline.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly diverse and powerful, cross-generator detection has emerged as a new challenge. Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

Motivation: To advance realistic talking head generation by integrating lip motion, facial expression, and head pose driven by audio inputs.

Method: Uses a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) with 3D representation, conditioned on a reference facial image and audio sequence.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ datasets, generating highly realistic talking heads.

Conclusion: Dimitra++ sets a new benchmark for audio-driven talking head generation, combining appearance and motion effectively.

Abstract: We propose Dimitra++, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation, streamlined to learn lip motion, facial expression, as well as head pose motion.

The cMDT is conditioned on two inputs: a reference facial image, which determines appearance, as well as an audio sequence, which drives the motion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments, as well as a user study on two widely employed datasets, i.e., VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ, suggest that Dimitra++ is able to outperform existing approaches in generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for effective ways to communicate research via posters, but understanding the link between papers and their layouts lacks large-scale datasets.

Method: Introduces SciPostGen dataset and a framework (Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation) that retrieves and uses layouts aligned with paper structures.

Result: Experiments show the retriever aligns layouts with paper structures, and the framework satisfies layout constraints.

Conclusion: SciPostGen and the framework bridge the gap between paper content and poster layouts, aiding effective research communication.

Abstract: As the number of scientific papers continues to grow, there is a demand for approaches that can effectively convey research findings, with posters serving as a key medium for presenting paper contents. Poster layouts determine how effectively research is communicated and understood, highlighting their growing importance. In particular, a gap remains in understanding how papers correspond to the layouts that present them, which calls for datasets with paired annotations at scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers. Our analyses based on SciPostGen show that paper structures are associated with the number of layout elements in posters. Based on this insight, we explore a framework, Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation, which retrieves layouts consistent with a given paper and uses them as guidance for layout generation. We conducted experiments under two conditions: with and without layout constraints typically specified by poster creators. The results show that the retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and our framework generates layouts that also satisfy given constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of text removal from complex document images with dense text, introducing a flexible mask profile method using Bayesian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-removal methods focus on simple scene text in outdoor images, leaving a gap for complex document images with dense text.

Method: Developed benchmark data for dense text removal and proposed modeling flexible mask profiles with Bayesian optimization.

Result: Character-wise masks were optimal, and precise mask tuning was crucial for performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for practical text removal and user-friendly manual masking guidelines.

Abstract: The advent of generative models has dramatically improved the accuracy of image inpainting. In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking.

TL;DR: DocVAL is a framework that transfers spatial reasoning from a large teacher model to a compact student model for DocVQA, achieving high accuracy without needing text detection or OCR at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in DocVQA, where large models are accurate but impractical for deployment, while smaller models lose localization performance.

Method: DocVAL uses validated chain-of-thought distillation with teacher supervision, a multi-module validator (VAL), and iterative student training.

Result: The student model achieves 91.4% ANLS and 82.4% mAP on DocVQA, with validated feedback and iterative refinement contributing significantly.

Conclusion: DocVAL successfully improves spatial reasoning in compact models, releasing verified CoT traces to aid further research.

Abstract: Document visual question answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly reason over textual content and spatial layout, yet current systems exhibit a sharp accuracy--efficiency trade-off: large teacher models achieve strong grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact students suffer substantial drops in localization performance. We propose DocVAL, a validated chain-of-thought distillation framework that transfers the spatial reasoning ability of a large teacher into a deployable student VLM through three key components: (1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter and denoise training signals, (2) a multi-module validator (VAL) that enforces answer correctness and geometric consistency while producing fine-grained, pixel-level error feedback, and (3) a two-stage student training scheme that first learns from validated CoT traces and then undergoes iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback. Our student (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4\% ANLS and 82.4\% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Extensive ablations demonstrate that validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain and iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement. We release 95k high-quality, validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

TL;DR: CoT4AD introduces Chain-of-Thought reasoning to Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving, improving numerical and causal reasoning for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLAs lack strong numerical reasoning and simplified input-output mappings, limiting effectiveness in complex driving scenarios.

Method: CoT4AD integrates visual and language inputs, using explicit perception-question-prediction-action reasoning during training and implicit CoT reasoning during inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world and simulated benchmarks like nuScenes and Bench2Drive.

Conclusion: CoT4AD enhances VLA models' reasoning and decision-making, proving effective for autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently attracted growing attention in end-to-end autonomous driving for their strong reasoning capabilities and rich world knowledge. However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning to enable consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated benchmarks, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive, demonstrate that CoT4AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: Fast3Dcache accelerates 3D diffusion inference by reusing stable latent features while maintaining geometric fidelity, reducing FLOPs and computation time with minimal quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D diffusion models suffer from high computational costs due to iterative denoising, and existing caching methods disrupt geometric consistency in 3D synthesis.

Method: Introduces Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) and Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to dynamically allocate cache quotas and select stable features for reuse.

Result: Achieves up to 27.12% speed-up and 54.8% FLOPs reduction, with minimal degradation (2.48% Chamfer Distance, 1.95% F-Score).

Conclusion: Fast3Dcache successfully balances speed and geometric quality in 3D diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).

TL;DR: Diff-ICMH is a generative image compression framework that harmonizes machine and human vision by ensuring perceptual realism and semantic fidelity, leveraging generative priors and a Semantic Consistency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between optimizing image compression for human perception and machine analysis by revealing their shared reliance on semantic information.

Method: Proposes Diff-ICMH, incorporating generative priors for perceptual realism and Semantic Consistency loss for semantic fidelity, along with a Tag Guidance Module for enhanced generative capabilities.

Result: Diff-ICMH outperforms existing methods across diverse tasks, supporting multiple intelligent tasks without task-specific adaptation while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies machine and human vision needs in image compression, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Image compression methods are usually optimized isolatedly for human perception or machine analysis tasks. We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks, while maintaining visual appeal for human perception.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art head and upper-body reconstruction and competitive full-body results, trained on half-body synthetic data alone. Experiments validate the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key bottlenecks in avatar reconstruction, demonstrating strong generalization and performance across diverse inputs.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for reconstructing animatable 3D human avatars from a single portrait across head, half-body, and full-body inputs. Our method tackles three bottlenecks: pose- and framing-sensitive feature representations, limited scalable data, and unreliable proxy-mesh estimation. We introduce a Dual-UV representation that maps image features to a canonical UV space via Core-UV and Shell-UV branches, eliminating pose- and framing-induced token shifts. We also build a factorized synthetic data manifold combining 2D generative diversity with geometry-consistent 3D renderings, supported by a training scheme that improves realism and identity consistency. A robust proxy-mesh tracker maintains stability under partial visibility. Together, these components enable strong in-the-wild generalization. Trained only on half-body synthetic data, our model achieves state-of-the-art head and upper-body reconstruction and competitive full-body results. Extensive experiments and analyses further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TCEAD, a text-guided AI framework for automated dental abutment design, improving efficiency and adaptability over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dental abutment design is slow and prone to complications like peri-implantitis. AI-assisted design can enhance speed and precision.

Method: TCEAD integrates a text-guided localization module into a self-supervised MeshMAE framework, pretrained on oral scan data for better feature extraction.

Result: TCEAD outperforms mainstream methods with IoU improvements of 0.8%-12.85%, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: TCEAD shows promise for automating dental abutment design, addressing inefficiencies and improving outcomes.

Abstract: The abutment is an important part of artificial dental implants, whose design process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design.

TL;DR: Summarize the paper's findings concisely


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the impact of different CoT designs on generalizable visual reasoning in VLMs.

Method: Compare three CoT formats (Language, Grounding, Visual) using a maze-solving benchmark and Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.

Result: Concise CoT with essential grounding steps generalizes best; visual/longer CoTs accelerate convergence but don't improve final performance.

Conclusion: A 'short is long' effect favors concise CoT designs for generalizable visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We study how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of the generalizable visual reasoning ability in vision-language models (VLMs). While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as "think with image", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a "short is long" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning.

Motivation: CLIP lacks region-level supervision, limiting fine-grained semantic understanding and causing a trade-off between local perception and global alignment.

Method: Introduces fine-grained semantic supervision and Region-Language Alignment to align textual segments with visual regions without disrupting global coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art improvement (up to 69.78%) in retrieval and 3.2% Top-1 accuracy boost in bounding-box classification.

Conclusion: HarmoCLIP provides a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to CLIP's global-local trade-off, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable generalization ability and strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

### [94] [AnoRefiner: Anomaly-Aware Group-Wise Refinement for Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22595)
*Dayou Huang,Feng Xue,Xurui Li,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnoRefiner improves patch-level anomaly maps to pixel-level by leveraging anomaly score maps and a novel refinement decoder, enhancing ZSAD models' performance without heavy reliance on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ZSAD methods produce coarse anomaly maps due to patch-level features, and existing solutions struggle with fine-grained anomalies because of synthetic-real data gaps.

Method: Proposes AnoRefiner with an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) and progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy to enhance features using anomaly score maps.

Result: AnoRefiner boosts ZSAD models by up to 5.2% in pixel-AP metrics on MVTec AD and VisA datasets.

Conclusion: AnoRefiner effectively refines anomaly maps to pixel-level, improving detection accuracy and reducing dependency on synthetic data.

Abstract: Zero-shot industrial anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods typically yield coarse anomaly maps as vision transformers (ViTs) extract patch-level features only. To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.
  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.
  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations. The code will be available at https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/AnoRefiner.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and methods significantly enhance gaze tracking accuracy, making it more suitable for spatial computing applications.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become increasingly important in virtual and augmented reality applications; however, the current gaze accuracy falls short of meeting the requirements for spatial computing. We designed a gaze collection framework and utilized high-precision equipment to gather the first precise benchmark dataset, GazeTrack, encompassing diverse ethnicities, ages, and visual acuity conditions for pupil localization and gaze tracking. We propose a novel shape error regularization method to constrain pupil ellipse fitting and train on open-source datasets, enhancing semantic segmentation and pupil position prediction accuracy. Additionally, we invent a novel coordinate transformation method similar to paper unfolding to accurately predict gaze vectors on the GazeTrack dataset. Finally, we built a gaze vector generation model that achieves reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to other methods.

Motivation: 

Method: We introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability.

Result: Our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay.

Conclusion: Highlights latent drift as replay signal for robust continual learning in medical settings.

Abstract: When deep learning models are sequentially trained on new data, they tend to abruptly lose performance on previously learned tasks, a critical failure known as catastrophic forgetting. This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings.

Motivation: Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy

Method: Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have shown remarkable progress. A common architectural design couples a multimodal large language model (MLLM) encoder with a diffusion decoder, as seen in systems such as Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, where the MLLM encodes both the reference image and the instruction but remains frozen during training. In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy. Based on that, our proposed framework enables image editing in a thinking-editing-reflection loop: the thinking mechanism leverages the world knowledge of MLLM to interpret abstract instructions, while the reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies the stopping round. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing our DiT from the Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S), and also outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).

TL;DR: GeoZero is a framework enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform geospatial reasoning without predefined chain-of-thought supervision, using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome high annotation costs and human biases in enhancing MLLMs' reasoning for geospatial tasks.

Method: Utilizes GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard datasets for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, respectively, and introduces Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO).

Result: GeoZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods and fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: GeoZero effectively enhances geospatial reasoning without CoT supervision, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have undergone rapid development in advancing geospatial scene understanding. Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks. Code,data,and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoZero.

TL;DR: This paper explores mitigating task conflicts in unified multimodal models without decoupling, proposing an Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss to refine cross-modal attention patterns and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models face conflicts between image generation and understanding tasks. While decoupling helps, it can undermine unified goals. The study aims to address these conflicts without decoupling.

Method: The authors analyze decoupling effects on multimodal attention patterns and introduce AIA loss to learn task-specific interactions. AIA is tested on Emu3 and Janus-Pro.

Result: AIA loss successfully refines attention patterns and enhances both generation and understanding performance without additional complexity.

Conclusion: The AIA loss offers a flexible solution to mitigate task conflicts in unified models, preserving their interleave generation ability while improving performance.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.

TL;DR: VaMP introduces a variational multi-modal prompt learning framework for uncertainty-aware and sample-specific adaptation of vision-language models, improving few-shot and domain generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt learning methods for VLMs lack adaptability to instance-level variations and uncertainty modeling, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks and domains.

Method: VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, incorporates class-aware priors, and formulates prompt tuning as variational inference.

Result: VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the benefits of modeling uncertainty and task structure, enabling personalized and adaptable multi-modal representation learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown strong generalization under zero-shot settings, yet adapting them to downstream tasks with limited supervision remains a significant challenge. Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the conventional belief that Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) excels due to distribution matching, revealing CFG Augmentation (CA) as the key driver in few-step distillation, while DM acts as a stabilizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reevaluate the core mechanism behind DMD's performance and uncover the actual roles of its components in tasks like text-to-image generation.

Method: Decomposes the DMD training objective, identifies CFG Augmentation (CA) as the primary driver, and proposes modifications like decoupling noise schedules for CA and DM.

Result: Shows CA is the 'engine' of distillation, DM is a 'regularizer,' and simpler alternatives can stabilize training. Proposes improvements leading to better performance.

Conclusion: The findings offer a deeper understanding of DMD, enabling principled modifications for enhanced performance, validated by adoption in the Z-Image project.

Abstract: Diffusion model distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for creating efficient few-step and single-step generators. Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains. Notably, our method has been adopted by the Z-Image ( https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image ) project to develop a top-tier 8-step image generation model, empirically validating the generalization and robustness of our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve 3DFMs' reasoning under extreme, non-overlapping views, which remains largely unexplored.

Method: Introduces a lightweight alignment scheme refining internal 3D representations by tuning a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving decoder heads frozen.

Result: Improved relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading depth or point quality per image.

Conclusion: The study highlights 3DFMs' capabilities in extreme-view scenarios and introduces MegaUnScene benchmark for further research.

Abstract: 3D foundation models (3DFMs) have recently transformed 3D vision, enabling joint prediction of depths, poses, and point maps directly from images. Yet their ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study their internal representations and find that 3DFMs exhibit an emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, despite never being trained for such conditions. To further enhance these capabilities, we introduce a lightweight alignment scheme that refines their internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving all decoder heads frozen. This targeted adaptation substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality. Additionally, we contribute MegaUnScene, a new benchmark of Internet scenes unseen by existing 3DFMs, with dedicated test splits for both relative pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. All code and data will be released.

Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals.

Method: Ar2Can uses two modules: Architect predicts structured layouts for person placement, and Artist synthesizes images guided by spatial alignment and identity similarity.

Result: Evaluated on MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can improves count accuracy and identity preservation while maintaining perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Ar2Can demonstrates reliable multi-human generation using synthetic data, advancing the field of text-to-image synthesis.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.

Motivation: To address the impracticality of large open-source models (20B-80B parameters) for consumer hardware, proposing a smaller yet competitive alternative.

Method: Developed Z-Image using Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT), optimized training workflow, and distilled into Z-Image-Turbo for faster inference.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to top models in photorealistic generation and bilingual text rendering, with low-cost training ($630K) and hardware compatibility.

Conclusion: Demonstrates state-of-the-art results with reduced computational overhead, promoting accessible and budget-friendly generative AI.

Abstract: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

TL;DR: Splat-SAP is a feed-forward method for rendering novel views from sparse binocular camera inputs using Gaussian Splatting, leveraging pixel-wise point maps and a two-stage learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods require dense input views or largely overlapped inputs for geometry priors, limiting their use in sparse-view scenarios.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) iterative affinity learning transforms point maps into real space for camera control; (2) stereo matching refines geometry for high-quality rendering.

Result: The method improves stability in point map reconstruction and visual quality in free-viewpoint rendering.

Conclusion: Splat-SAP successfully addresses sparse-view challenges in human-centered scene rendering, offering robust performance without dense input dependencies.

Abstract: We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries due to underrepresented pre-training data, and current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision and noisy passages.

Method: Proposes ReAG, integrating coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model for filtering irrelevant passages, using multi-stage training with reinforcement learning.

Result: ReAG outperforms prior methods on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek, improving accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning.

Conclusion: ReAG effectively addresses limitations in KB-VQA by enhancing retrieval quality and reasoning, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

*Amir Mohammad Ezzati,Alireza Malekhosseini,Armin Khosravi,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) to improve domain generalization in computational pathology by learning domain-invariant prompts for knowledge distillation from vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in computational pathology due to variations in staining protocols and imaging settings hinder model generalization. Vision-language models lack adaptability to prompt variations and domain-specific descriptors.

Method: Proposes DIPT, which learns multiple input tokens per domain, trains them separately, and averages them to create domain-invariant prompts. A student model then distills knowledge from these prompts.

Result: DIPT significantly improves average F1-score over existing state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods in domain generalization for histopathology datasets.

Conclusion: DIPT enhances the deployment of robust computational pathology models in real-world clinical settings with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Domain generalization is critical in computational pathology (CPath) due to inherent domain shifts caused by variations in staining protocols, scanner devices, and imaging settings across clinical centers. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources.

TL;DR: Study develops a three-channel DDPM for synthesizing breast mammograms, evaluating channel encodings' impact on fidelity and consistency. Results show synthetic images closely match real ones, with sum/absolute difference encodings performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance mammogram dataset augmentation by generating realistic and anatomically consistent dual-view synthetic images, addressing the need for diverse training data.

Method: Fine-tuned a pretrained three-channel DDPM on a private dataset of 11,020 mammograms to generate CC and MLO views. Evaluated three third-channel encodings (sum, absolute difference, zero) and assessed synthetic images quantitatively (IoU, DSC, EMD, KS tests) and qualitatively (visual Turing test).

Result: Synthetic mammograms matched real images in IoU/DSC distributions (EMD: 0.020, KS: 0.077). Sum/absolute difference encodings outperformed others (p < 0.001). Cross-view consistency was maintained, with 6-8% showing artifacts.

Conclusion: Three-channel DDPMs effectively generate realistic dual-view mammograms, offering potential for dataset augmentation in medical imaging.

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and to assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency. Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.

TL;DR: The study evaluates VIS-TIR fusion methods for wildlife detection using deep learning, showing improved accuracy despite alignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance wildlife monitoring by combining VIS and TIR imagery for better automated detection.

Method: Used YOLOv11n model with early and late fusion methods; aligned images via deep learning.

Result: Both fusion methods improved F1 scores; late fusion boosted nest detection accuracy to 93%.

Conclusion: Fusion improves results but has limitations; high-resolution VIS sensors may offer operational alternatives.

Abstract: Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.

*Mahdieh Behjat Khatooni,Mohsen Soryani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining CNNs and Vision Transformers with BiLSTMs achieves high accuracy in predicting Alzheimer's disease progression from MRI scans and biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for intervention, and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a key stage for diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression is challenging.

Method: The study proposes an end-to-end deep learning model integrating CNNs and Vision Transformers for spatial features from MRIs and BiLSTMs for temporal progression analysis using consecutive scans and biomarkers.

Result: The model achieved 95.05% accuracy in distinguishing stable MCI from progressive MCI, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction, emphasizing the value of combining spatial and temporal modeling.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs memory, decision-making, and overall cognitive function. As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction. This work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction and highlights the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal modeling for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

TL;DR: The paper explores how well vision language models (VLMs) detect emotional expression in artworks, finding they excel with concrete images but struggle with abstract or symbolic ones, while also showing inconsistency in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotions are central to art but abstract and historically variable, making their analysis challenging. The study aims to evaluate how effectively current VLMs can detect emotional aspects in artworks.

Method: A case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) tested with four sets of progressively complex questions about artworks, followed by qualitative expert evaluation.

Result: VLMs perform well recognizing content and emotions in concrete images but struggle with abstract or symbolic ones. They also exhibit inconsistency in responses.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise in analyzing emotional expression in art but face limitations with abstraction and symbolism, alongside persistent inconsistency issues.

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive culturally mixed visual scenes, identifies their struggles in preserving cultural identities, and proposes improvements through supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LVLMs' ability to handle culturally diverse visual scenes is crucial for their reliable use in globalized settings.

Method: The study uses CultureMix, a 23k-image VQA benchmark with four subtasks, to evaluate 10 LVLMs. Robustness strategies, including supervised fine-tuning, are tested.

Result: LVLMs fail to preserve cultural identities in mixed settings, showing background reliance and inconsistency. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better LVLM handling of culture mixing scenarios and demonstrates the effectiveness of diverse training datasets.

Abstract: In a globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together within a single visual scene. We refer to these as culture mixing scenarios, yet how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive them remains underexplored. We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality datasets and models for Indian language scene text recognition, which lags behind English due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles.

Method: Introduces BSTD, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ words across 11 Indian languages and English, annotated for multiple tasks. Adapts state-of-the-art English models for Indian languages.

Result: Results highlight challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition, showcasing the dataset's utility.

Conclusion: BSTD advances research in Indian language scene text recognition, with all models and data being open source.

Abstract: Reading scene text, that is, text appearing in images, has numerous application areas, including assistive technology, search, and e-commerce. Although scene text recognition in English has advanced significantly and is often considered nearly a solved problem, Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge. This is due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles, and, more importantly, the lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models. To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition. We believe that this dataset represents a significant step toward advancing research in this domain. All our models and data are open source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in MLLMs' ability to understand nuanced, subjective image properties (e.g., memorability, humor) compared to human perception.

Method: Introduce CogIP-Bench for benchmarking MLLMs on cognitive properties, then use post-training to align models with human judgments.

Result: Post-training significantly improves alignment with human perception, and this alignment transfers to creative tasks like generating more memorable or appealing images.

Conclusion: CogIP-Bench measures human-like perception in MLLMs, post-training enhances it, and alignment enables more human-centric AI applications.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LC4-DViT combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer for high-resolution land-cover classification, achieving superior accuracy and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate land-cover maps are essential for environmental stewardship, but existing methods face challenges like scarce annotations and geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes.

Method: The proposed LC4-DViT framework uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize balanced training images. It integrates a deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to capture fine-scale geometry and global context.

Result: LC4-DViT achieves high accuracy (0.9572 OA, 0.9576 macro F1) on AID and good transferability (0.9333 OA) on SIRI-WHU, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: Combining generative augmentation with deformation-aware transformers is promising for high-resolution land-cover mapping.

Abstract: Land-cover underpins ecosystem services, hydrologic regulation, disaster-risk reduction, and evidence-based land planning; timely, accurate land-cover maps are therefore critical for environmental stewardship. Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures. These results suggest that description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping.

TL;DR: Captain Safari introduces pose-conditioned world memory retrieval for stable, long-range 3D-consistent video generation, outperforming SOTA methods on OpenSafari dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world engines fail under aggressive trajectories and complex layouts, losing coherence or deviating from paths.

Method: Uses pose-conditioned dynamic local memory and retrieval to fetch aligned tokens for video generation.

Result: Reduces MEt3R, improves AUC@30, and achieves lower FVD; 67.6% human preference in study.

Conclusion: Pose-conditioned memory enables long-horizon controllable video generation; OpenSafari serves as a benchmark.

Abstract: World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.

TL;DR: LVLMs show promise for object detection in industrial applications like autonomous driving but require synchronized driver and road-facing views for comprehensive safety. Fine-tuned LVLMs perform better than pre-trained ones, yet challenges remain in detecting subtle events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance safety in autonomous driving by leveraging LVLMs to process synchronized inputs from driver and road-facing cameras, addressing gaps in detecting risky behaviors like mobile phone use.

Method: Researchers developed models, constructed a dataset, and evaluated LVLM performance, comparing pre-trained and fine-tuned versions.

Result: Fine-tuned LVLMs outperformed pre-trained ones in generating safety-aware driving instructions, but struggled with subtle or complex event detection.

Conclusion: While LVLMs show potential, further improvements are needed to handle nuanced events, with findings offering insights for future LVLM-based safety systems.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.

Motivation: Assess robustness of MLLMs against contradicting modalities and address their brittleness in multi-modal reasoning.

Method: Introduces MMA-Bench with videos/tasks, uses black-box/white-box interpretability techniques, and proposes modality alignment tuning.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle with misaligned modalities; alignment tuning improves multimodal grounding.

Conclusion: Modality alignment tuning enhances MLLMs' reliability, providing tools for robust cross-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a fundamental question remains: are MLLMs robust to contradicting modalities? To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. Code and dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper addresses 'visual shortcuts' in MKB-VQA benchmarks by introducing RETINA, a new benchmark with secondary subject queries, and proposes MIMIR, a model that improves performance by using multiple related entity images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MKB-VQA benchmarks allow models to exploit visual shortcuts, leading to inflated performance. The authors aim to create a more robust benchmark and model to address this issue.

Method: The authors develop RETINA, a benchmark constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, and propose MIMIR, which enhances document embeddings with multiple related entity images.

Result: Existing models perform poorly on RETINA, confirming their reliance on shortcuts. MIMIR outperforms prior work by effectively handling RETINA's challenges.

Conclusion: RETINA successfully exposes the limitations of current benchmarks, and MIMIR demonstrates superior performance by mitigating visual shortcut reliance.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (MKB-VQA) benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts", as the query image typically matches the primary subject entity of the target document. We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.

TL;DR: SLEUTH is a multi-agent framework that improves Vision Language Models' performance on long documents by hierarchically refining retrieved content and synthesizing evidence-dense multimodal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with long documents due to scattered clues and redundancy, even with retrieval-augmented methods.

Method: SLEUTH employs a retriever and four agents in a coarse-to-fine process to identify key clues, filter visual evidence, analyze queries, and synthesize distilled contexts.

Result: SLEUTH achieves state-of-the-art results on long document benchmarks when paired with advanced VLM backbones.

Conclusion: The framework's hierarchical refinement effectively addresses redundancy and improves performance, as validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Document understanding is a long standing practical task. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gradually become a primary approach in this domain, demonstrating effective performance on single page tasks. However, their effectiveness diminishes when handling long documents. In such scenarios, clues are often scattered across multiple pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs can impair the models judgment. While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results. Ablation studies verify each modules effectiveness and confirm the benefits of our hierarchical refinement paradigm.

TL;DR: GLOW is a new framework for inverse rendering of indoor scenes that addresses challenges like inter-reflections and lighting ambiguity by combining neural implicit surfaces with a dynamic radiance cache.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse rendering techniques struggle with disentangling reflectance and lighting due to complexities like inter-reflections and dynamic shadows, especially in co-located light-camera setups.

Method: GLOW uses neural implicit surfaces and a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, with joint optimization of geometry and reflectance. It includes a dynamic radiance cache and radiometric loss to handle sharp lighting discontinuities and specular artifacts.

Result: GLOW outperforms existing methods in estimating material reflectance under natural and co-located illumination.

Conclusion: GLOW effectively tackles inverse rendering challenges in indoor scenes, improving reflectance estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, exacerbated by inter-reflections among multiple objects. While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.

### [123] [CoordSpeaker: Exploiting Gesture Captioning for Coordinated Caption-Empowered Co-Speech Gesture Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22863)
*Fengyi Fang,Sicheng Yang,Wenming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoordSpeaker addresses semantic gaps and multimodal control challenges in co-speech gesture generation by introducing gesture captioning and a conditional latent diffusion model for coordinated, high-quality output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for co-speech gesture generation struggle with semantic prior gaps from missing text annotations and difficulties in multimodal control.

Method: CoordSpeaker uses a gesture captioning framework to bridge semantic gaps and a conditional latent diffusion model for controlled gesture synthesis.

Result: The method produces rhythmically synchronized and semantically coherent gestures, outperforming existing approaches in quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: CoordSpeaker pioneers gesture-text bidirectional mapping, offering advanced solutions for semantic-aware and controlled gesture generation.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation has significantly advanced human-computer interaction, yet speaker movements remain constrained due to the omission of text-driven non-spontaneous gestures (e.g., bowing while talking). Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion transformer model for generating 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks, addressing challenges like high-dimensional dynamics and cross-subject heterogeneity. It outperforms baselines and offers potential applications in virtual experiments and neuroimaging augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks is difficult due to high-dimensional dynamics, heterogeneity across subjects/acquisitions, and lack of neuroscience-grounded validation.

Method: The model combines 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone, using AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention for strong task conditioning.

Result: The model successfully reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves inter-task structure (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with hemodynamic responses. It outperforms a U-Net baseline with correlations of 0.83 (task-evoked maps) and 0.98 (RSA).

Conclusion: This work establishes a scalable and practical approach for conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, with promising applications like virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and neuroimaging model augmentation.

Abstract: Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks remains challenging due to the high-dimensional, heterogeneous BOLD dynamics across subjects/acquisitions and the lack of neuroscience-grounded validation. We introduce the first diffusion transformer for voxelwise 4D fMRI conditional generation, combining 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone and strong task conditioning via AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention. On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models.

### [125] [CNN-Based Framework for Pedestrian Age and Gender Classification Using Far-View Surveillance in Mixed-Traffic Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22873)
*Shisir Shahriar Arif,Md. Muhtashim Shahrier,Nazmul Haque,Md Asif Raihan,Md. Hadiuzzaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using CNNs classifies pedestrian age and gender from intersection footage, achieving high accuracy for real-time demographic monitoring in urban areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian safety in congested urban intersections, especially in low- and middle-income countries, lacks real-time demographic monitoring despite its significance.

Method: Uses CNNs (ResNet50 and a custom lightweight CNN) to classify age and gender from far-view footage, tested at high-risk intersections in Dhaka.

Result: ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved 86.19% accuracy, while the custom CNN matched performance (84.15%) with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The system provides scalable, cost-effective demographic monitoring, aiding inclusive traffic planning and safety interventions.

Abstract: Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern in congested urban intersections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where traffic is multimodal, and infrastructure often lacks formal control. Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.

*Kailin Lyu,Jianwei He,Long Xiao,Jianing Zeng,Liang Fan,Lin Shu,Jie Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClearGCD addresses prototype confusion in Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) by using Semantic View Alignment and Shortcut Suppression Regularization to improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods struggle with prototype confusion due to shortcut learning, leading to poor generalization and forgetting of known classes.

Method: ClearGCD introduces Semantic View Alignment (SVA) for semantic consistency via strong augmentations and Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) to maintain adaptive prototypes.

Result: ClearGCD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks.

Conclusion: ClearGCD effectively mitigates shortcut learning issues and enhances GCD performance.

Abstract: In open-world scenarios, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires identifying both known and novel categories within unlabeled data. However, existing methods often suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. We propose ClearGCD, a framework designed to mitigate reliance on non-semantic cues through two complementary mechanisms. First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

*Weiran Li,Yeqiang Liu,Yijie Wei,Mina Han,Qiannan Guo,Zhenbo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DM$^3$T is a novel multimodal MOT framework that iteratively aligns features from visible light and thermal infrared modalities using Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion and Diffusion Refiner, achieving superior tracking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal MOT methods struggle with fusing heterogeneous modalities due to non-linear feature gaps, leading to modality conflicts and degraded accuracy.

Method: Proposes DM$^3$T with Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion for iterative feature alignment and Diffusion Refiner for feature enhancement, alongside a Hierarchical Tracker.

Result: Achieves 41.7 HOTA on VT-MOT benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 1.54%.

Conclusion: DM$^3$T effectively bridges modality gaps, enabling robust multimodal tracking without complex post-processing.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [128] [From Points to Clouds: Learning Robust Semantic Distributions for Multi-modal Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22897)
*Weiran Li,Yeqiang Liu,Yijie Wei,Mina Han,Xin Liu,Zhenbo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel multimodal prompt learning framework that shifts from single-point representations to semantic clouds for better generalization, outperforming baselines across 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal prompt learning methods suffer from brittleness and poor generalization due to reliance on single-point representations, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: P2C reframes prompt learning as dynamic denoising, using a dual mechanism: Dynamic Prompt Denoising for smoother semantics and a V-L Mapper denoising loss for cross-modal alignment.

Result: P2C achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7% on base-to-novel generalization, a 1.4% improvement over baselines, and demonstrates consistent performance across 11 datasets.

Conclusion: The semantic cloud approach in P2C significantly enhances robustness and generalization in multimodal prompt learning, validated by extensive experimental results.

Abstract: Multimodal Prompt Learning (MPL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for adapting large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline. The code and models are available at https://vranlee.github.io/P2C/.

*Kyu Ri Park,Jiyoung Park,Seong Tae Kim,Hong Joo Lee,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORTEX enhances change captioning by integrating textual cues with visual features for better understanding of subtle changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely solely on visual features, missing meaningful changes due to lack of structured information like object relationships.

Method: CORTEX combines pixel-level visual cues with scene-level textual knowledge from VLMs, using modules for change detection, reasoning-aware text extraction, and image-text alignment.

Result: CORTEX captures ambiguous changes by reasoning over aligned visual and textual features.

Conclusion: Integrating textual cues with visual features improves change captioning accuracy.

Abstract: Change captioning aims to describe changes between a pair of images. However, existing works rely on visual features alone, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack the ability to represent explicitly structured information such as object relationships and compositional semantics. To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat text queries and video clips as black-boxes, lacking contextual understanding. This paper aims to enhance semantic understanding by focusing on individual words.

Method: Proposes fine-grained clip filtering using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a feature enhancement module (FEM) to identify important words, and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to refine clips iteratively.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves performance by leveraging important words in queries and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) with natural language queries aim to localize relevant moments and key highlights in a video clips. However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips. We introduce a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from the query and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on their relevance to these important words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both MR and HD tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-D registration methods often fail to fully exploit image information due to limitations in feature fusion or learning, restricting their practical use.

Method: ViGG employs mutual guidance: geometric guidance suppresses ambiguous cliques, while visual-guided geometric matching uses visual priors to enhance correspondence quality and noise resistance.

Result: ViGG achieves superior performance on 3DMatch, ScanNet, and KITTI datasets, surpassing recent learning-free and learning-based methods.

Conclusion: The mutual guidance strategy in ViGG enhances robustness and applicability for diverse RGB-D registration tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D vision. Most existing methods only use geometric information for registration. Recently proposed RGB-D registration methods primarily focus on feature fusion or improving feature learning, which limits their ability to exploit image information and hinders their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose ViGG, a robust RGB-D registration method using mutual guidance. First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks. The experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and KITTI datasets show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in both learning-free and learning-based settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuMatC is a neural framework that leverages low-rankness and continuity for efficient parametric matrix operations, achieving significant speedups over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional matrix operations neglect inherent low-rankness and continuity in parametric tasks, leading to redundant computations. NeuMatC addresses this inefficiency.

Method: NeuMatC learns a low-rank, continuous mapping from parameters to matrix operation results unsupervisedly, enabling efficient computations with minimal operations.

Result: NeuMatC achieves over 3× speedup in parametric inversion and 10× speedup in parametric SVD compared to NumPy, with acceptable accuracy.

Conclusion: NeuMatC offers a promising solution for efficient parametric matrix operations by exploiting low-rankness and continuity, reducing computational redundancy.

Abstract: Matrix operations (e.g., inversion and singular value decomposition (SVD)) are fundamental in science and engineering. In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously. However, conventional methods tackle each matrix operation independently, underexploring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension, resulting in significantly redundant computation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{\textit{Neural Matrix Computation Framework} (NeuMatC)}, which elegantly tackles general parametric matrix operation tasks by leveraging the underlying low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension. Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurately recovering tampered regions in digital media due to the rise of AI-generated content.

Method: Proposes ReImage, embedding shuffled watermarks into images, optimizing watermark generation, and refining recovery with an enhancement module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse tampering scenarios, producing high-quality recovered images.

Conclusion: ReImage effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering reliable image self-recovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) raises concerns about the authenticity of digital media. In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data. However, existing methods often fail to accurately recover tampered regions, falling short of the primary goal of self-recovery. To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark. We design a generator that produces watermarks optimized for neural watermarking and introduce an image enhancement module to refine the recovered image. We further analyze and resolve key limitations of shuffled watermarking, enabling its effective use in self-recovery. We demonstrate that ReImage achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tampering scenarios, consistently producing high-quality recovered images. The code and pretrained models will be released upon publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving burst denoising methods for handheld devices, which struggle with large motion and high computational costs.

Method: Proposes DenoiseGS with Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss and log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss for regularization and detail preservation.

Result: Outperforms NeRF-based methods in denoising and novel view synthesis, with 250x faster inference.

Conclusion: DenoiseGS is highly effective and efficient for burst denoising, offering superior performance and speed.

Abstract: Burst denoising methods are crucial for enhancing images captured on handheld devices, but they often struggle with large motion or suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \textbf{250$\times$} faster inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with spatially misaligned references and matched skeletal structures, limiting their application to diverse layouts.

Method: The framework reformulates training as a self-supervised outpainting task, uses a reference extractor for identity features, integrates hybrid reference fusion attention, and decouples appearance from skeletal structure.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully handles arbitrary layouts and improves generation quality, with code and model made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved pose-driven character animation. However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/ssj9596/One-to-All-Animation.

TL;DR: FLEX-Seg addresses domain shifts in semantic segmentation by leveraging misalignment in diffusion-generated data, using adaptive prototypes, uncertainty emphasis, and hardness-aware sampling for robust learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in domain generalization due to domain shifts and misalignment in synthetic data prompted the development of a framework that turns these limitations into advantages.

Method: FLEX-Seg includes Granular Adaptive Prototypes, Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis, and Hardness-Aware Sampling to exploit misalignment and improve robustness.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements, with 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data enhance domain generalization, validating FLEX-Seg's effectiveness.

Abstract: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, particularly under adverse conditions. While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich. Our findings validate that adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/FLEX-Seg.

*Haiyang Mei,Qiming Huang,Hai Ci,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in images and videos, addressing challenges like robot embodiment diversity and rapid shape changes. It improves upon SAM 2 with innovations like a structure-enhanced memory associator and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate robot segmentation is crucial for robotic perception, enabling tasks like visual servoing and safety monitoring. Existing models struggle due to robot diversity and structural complexity.

Method: RobotSeg builds on SAM 2 but introduces a structure-enhanced memory associator, robot prompt generator, and label-efficient training strategy to overcome its limitations.

Result: RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on images and videos, supported by a newly constructed VRS dataset with 2.8k videos and 138k frames.

Conclusion: RobotSeg provides a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution, setting a strong foundation for future robot perception advancements.

Abstract: Accurate robot segmentation is a fundamental capability for robotic perception. It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between high-quality text rendering and practical deployment by developing an efficient, compact model without sacrificing performance.

Method: Built on the Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image combines a diffusion-based visual decoder with the Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, using a text-focused training pipeline that includes pre-training and post-training refinements.

Result: Ovis-Image matches the text rendering performance of larger open models (e.g., Qwen-Image) and nears closed-source systems (e.g., Seedream, GPT4o), while being deployable on a single high-end GPU.

Conclusion: A strong multimodal backbone paired with a text-focused training pipeline can achieve reliable bilingual text rendering efficiently, avoiding oversized or proprietary models.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Ovis-Image}$, a 7B text-to-image model specifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints. Built upon our previous Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image integrates a diffusion-based visual decoder with the stronger Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, leveraging a text-centric training pipeline that combines large-scale pre-training with carefully tailored post-training refinements. Despite its compact architecture, Ovis-Image achieves text rendering performance on par with significantly larger open models such as Qwen-Image and approaches closed-source systems like Seedream and GPT4o. Crucially, the model remains deployable on a single high-end GPU with moderate memory, narrowing the gap between frontier-level text rendering and practical deployment. Our results indicate that combining a strong multimodal backbone with a carefully designed, text-focused training recipe is sufficient to achieve reliable bilingual text rendering without resorting to oversized or proprietary models.

*Shiyu Shen,Zhe Gao,Taifeng Chai,Yang Huang,Bin Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SolarCHIP introduces contrastively pretrained visual backbones for solar image analysis, addressing challenges like multimodal sensing and weak inter-class separability, and achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks like flare classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solar image analysis methods often ignore the unique characteristics of SDO data. SolarCHIP aims to provide tailored pretraining for multi-instrument observations.

Method: SolarCHIP uses a multi-granularity contrastive objective to align global class tokens, local patch tokens, and intra-sample patches, training CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders.

Result: SolarCHIP outperforms existing methods in cross-modal translation and flare classification, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: SolarCHIP offers a reusable, efficient feature extractor for solar imaging, reducing computational needs and improving label efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized solar image analysis, yet most approaches train task-specific encoders from scratch or rely on natural-image pretraining that ignores the unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.

TL;DR: MIMM-X is a framework designed to mitigate shortcut learning in medical imaging by disentangling causal features from spurious correlations, improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often rely on spurious correlations (shortcut learning) in medical imaging, leading to poor generalization and severe misclassifications.

Method: MIMM-X minimizes mutual information between causal features and spurious correlations to ensure predictions are based on true causal relationships.

Result: Evaluated on UK Biobank, NAKO, and CheXpert datasets (MRI and X-ray), MIMM-X effectively reduces shortcut learning.

Conclusion: MIMM-X successfully addresses multiple spurious correlations in medical imaging, enhancing model reliability.

Abstract: Deep learning models can excel on medical tasks, yet often experience spurious correlations, known as shortcut learning, leading to poor generalization in new environments. Particularly in medical imaging, where multiple spurious correlations can coexist, misclassifications can have severe consequences. We propose MIMM-X, a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. It enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts. We evaluate MIMM-X on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.

*Chen Li,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hierarchical multimodal representation aligns 3D scene features with VLMs using text and multi-view images, improving 3D scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based methods struggle with implicit alignment due to limited 3D data and spatial complexity.

Method: Explicit alignment via hierarchical feature representation using text descriptions and multi-view images.

Result: Improved performance on 3D Q&A benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances 3D scene reasoning by leveraging explicit multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that treats visual actions as core reasoning primitives to ensure grounded and effective vision-language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, leading to ungrounded reasoning and ineffective crops. This creates an illusion of visual grounding without refining perception or guiding reasoning.

Method: ViRL integrates Process Supervision, Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to ensure meaningful visual rationalization.

Result: ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks in perception, hallucination, and reasoning, trained purely with end-to-end RL.

Conclusion: Visual rationalization is established as a task-agnostic paradigm for transparent and trustworthy vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language reasoning underscore the importance of thinking with images, where models actively ground their reasoning in visual evidence. Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to "get the right answer for the right visual reason". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models.

*Shouhe Zhang,Dayong Ren,Sensen Song,Yurong Qian,Zhenhong Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semantic SLAM framework enhances illumination invariance using proactive intrinsic appearance normalization and reactive dynamic radiance balancing loss, achieving robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme exposure negatively impacts 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation, harming tightly-coupled systems. The goal is to achieve illumination invariance for better robustness.

Method: The framework includes: 1) Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) to disentangle scene properties like albedo from transient lighting, and 2) Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) to reactively correct extreme exposure.

Result: The system shows state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic/geometric accuracy on public datasets.

Conclusion: The synergy of proactive IAN and reactive DRB-Loss provides unprecedented robustness against extreme lighting conditions.

Abstract: Extreme exposure degrades both the 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled systems. To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.

TL;DR: BlockVid is a novel semi-autoregressive framework for minute-long video generation, addressing KV-cache errors and benchmark gaps with semantic-aware caching and LV-Bench metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate realistic, extended scenes for AI simulators by overcoming long-horizon errors and the lack of fine-grained benchmarks.

Method: BlockVid uses semantic-aware sparse KV cache, Block Forcing training, and chunk-wise noise scheduling/shuffling.

Result: BlockVid outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving VDE Subject by 22.2% and VDE Clarity by 19.4%.

Conclusion: BlockVid advances minute-long video generation with improved coherence and efficiency, validated by LV-Bench.

Abstract: Generating minute-long videos is a critical step toward developing world models, providing a foundation for realistic extended scenes and advanced AI simulators. The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

*Qiushi Yang,Yingjie Chen,Yuan Yao,Yifang Men,Huaizhuo Liu,Miaomiao Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: McSc is a reinforcement learning framework addressing video preference alignment by decomposing preferences, using hierarchical reasoning, and correcting motion bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference is challenging due to subjective judgment and reliance on costly annotations or proxy metrics.

Method: McSc employs a three-stage approach: ScDR for per-dimension preference assessment, HCR for hierarchical video comparison, and McDPO to optimize T2V models while correcting motion bias.

Result: McSc outperforms existing methods in human preference alignment and generates videos with improved motion dynamics.

Conclusion: McSc effectively addresses preference alignment challenges in T2V generation by integrating dimensional reasoning and motion correction.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.

*Felipe Akio Matsuoka,Eduardo Moreno J. M. Farina,Augusto Sarquis Serpa,Soraya Monteiro,Rodrigo Ragazzini,Nitamar Abdala,Marcelo Straus Takahashi,Felipe Campos Kitamura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative inpainting degrades medical AI performance, increasing bone age prediction errors and reducing gender classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether generative model-based inpainting preserves clinically relevant features in pediatric hand radiographs for tasks like bone age and gender prediction.

Method: Used RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, inpainted 200 radiographs, and assessed performance using deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification.

Result: Inpainting worsened performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, gender AUC dropped from 0.955 to 0.704. Pixel intensity changes indicated structural alterations.

Conclusion: Generative inpainting, though visually realistic, can obscure critical clinical features and introduce bias, necessitating task-specific validation before clinical use.

Abstract: Generative foundation models can remove visual artifacts through realistic image inpainting, but their impact on medical AI performance remains uncertain. Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.

*Hong Zheng,Nan Mu,Han Su,Lin Feng,Xiaoning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF) to reduce noise in feature signal matrices of segmentation networks, validated by experiments on cardiac MR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise reduction is often overlooked in segmentation networks, potentially harming feature system outcomes. The study aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes a low-amplitude pass filter (CFF) for noise reduction in Gaussian-distributed convolutional features, tested on 2D networks and cardiac MR datasets.

Result: Experiments confirmed noise reduction in feature signals, with a binarization equation developed to quantify information entropy changes.

Conclusion: The CFF effectively reduces noise in convolutional features, improving segmentation network performance.

Abstract: Noise reduction constitutes a crucial operation within Digital Signal Processing. Regrettably, it frequently remains neglected when dealing with the processing of convolutional features in segmentation networks. This oversight could trigger the butterfly effect, impairing the subsequent outcomes within the entire feature system. To complete this void, we consider convolutional features following Gaussian distributions as feature signal matrices and then present a simple and effective feature filter in this study. The proposed filter is fundamentally a low-amplitude pass filter primarily aimed at minimizing noise in feature signal inputs and is named Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF). We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices. To enable a numerical observation and analysis of this reduction, we developed a binarization equation to calculate the information entropy of feature signals.

TL;DR: SpaceMind is a multimodal large language model designed for 3D spatial reasoning from RGB inputs, using a dual-encoder architecture and camera-guided modality fusion to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D spatial reasoning rely on auxiliary 3D data or shallow feature fusion, limiting their performance and practicality.

Method: SpaceMind integrates VGGT and InternViT encoders, introduces a Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module, and uses camera-conditioned biasing and embedding for effective fusion.

Result: SpaceMind achieves state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D, and SPBench, surpassing open and proprietary systems.

Conclusion: Camera-guided modality fusion effectively equips VLMs with spatial reasoning capabilities, advancing spatially grounded intelligence.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong multimodal understanding but still struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as distance estimation, size comparison, and cross-view consistency. Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.

TL;DR: MultiBanana is a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate text-to-image models' multi-reference generation and editing capabilities, addressing gaps in existing datasets by testing various multi-reference conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets lack comprehensive evaluation of multi-reference generation, limiting understanding of model performance and weaknesses in diverse conditions.

Method: MultiBanana introduces a dataset covering five multi-reference-specific problems: varying reference counts, domain mismatch, scale mismatch, rare concepts, and multilingual references.

Result: Analysis of text-to-image models highlights their strengths, failure modes, and areas needing improvement in multi-reference settings.

Conclusion: MultiBanana aims to standardize evaluation and push the boundaries of multi-reference image generation, providing an open benchmark for fair comparison.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image generation models have acquired the ability of multi-reference generation and editing; the ability to inherit the appearance of subjects from multiple reference images and re-render them under new contexts. However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation.

TL;DR: A spectrum-weakening framework is proposed for visual autoregressive models to enhance generation quality and condition alignment without re-training or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classifier-free guidance tied to diffusion models by enabling unconditional and conditional generation improvements in autoregressive models.

Method: Constructs a controllable weak model in the spectral domain, preserving information while selectively reducing it. Uses spectrum selection and renormalization strategies for stability.

Result: Achieves high-quality unconditional generation and strong prompt alignment for conditional generation in experiments with discrete and continuous AR models.

Conclusion: The spectrum-weakening framework effectively enhances autoregressive models without requiring re-training or specific conditions.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become a widely adopted and practical approach for enhancing generation quality and improving condition alignment. Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic AI-generated images threatens social trust, necessitating explainable forensic methods beyond surface-level pattern matching.

Method: Introduces REVEAL-Bench, a multimodal dataset with step-by-step reasoning traces, and REVEAL, a framework combining detection with expert-grounded reinforcement learning.

Result: REVEAL achieves superior detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and cross-model generalization, setting a new standard in explainable forensics.

Conclusion: REVEAL addresses critical gaps in image forensics by providing verifiable, interpretable reasoning chains alongside accurate detection.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.

### [154] [MrGS: Multi-modal Radiance Fields with 3D Gaussian Splatting for RGB-Thermal Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22997)
*Minseong Kweon,Janghyun Kim,Ukcheol Shin,Jinsun Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MrGS is a novel multi-modal radiance field based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that reconstructs RGB and thermal 3D scenes by leveraging orthogonal feature extraction and physics-based principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook thermal characteristics like heat conduction and Lambertian properties in multi-modal rendering. MrGS addresses this gap.

Method: MrGS extracts RGB and thermal features from a single appearance feature using orthogonal extraction. It employs physics-based principles (Fourier's law and Stefan-Boltzmann law) to model thermal phenomena.

Result: MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.

Conclusion: MrGS successfully integrates thermal imagery with RGB scenes, improving multi-modal rendering fidelity.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved considerable performance in RGB scene reconstruction. However, multi-modal rendering that incorporates thermal infrared imagery remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches tend to neglect distinctive thermal characteristics, such as heat conduction and the Lambertian property. In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.

TL;DR: JarvisEvo is an advanced image editing agent addressing instruction hallucination and reward hacking with iMCoT reasoning and SEPO, outperforming Nano-Banana by 18.95%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations like instruction hallucination and reward hacking in current agent-based editing models.

Method: Introduces JarvisEvo with iMCoT reasoning and SEPO framework for self-improvement, plus Adobe Lightroom integration.

Result: Outperforms Nano-Banana by 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, with 44.96% better pixel-level fidelity.

Conclusion: JarvisEvo effectively enhances editing quality and mitigates reward hacking through innovative reasoning and optimization.

Abstract: Agent-based editing models have substantially advanced interactive experiences, processing quality, and creative flexibility. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom. On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, including a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

*Silvia Zuffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel learning-based method estimates aboveground biomass (AGB) from a single RGB image using dense prediction and synthetic 3D forest data, achieving low median errors (~1-2 kg/m²).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate AGB estimation is vital for carbon storage assessment and wildfire prevention, but traditional methods are labor-intensive or limited in dense vegetation.

Method: Proposes a dense prediction task using AGB density maps from RGB images, trained on synthetic 3D SPREAD data with allometric equations and instance segmentation.

Result: Achieves median errors of 1.22 kg/m² (synthetic) and 1.94 kg/m² (real data), offering scalable and cost-effective forest monitoring.

Conclusion: First RGB-based AGB estimation method, enabling citizen science and scalable forest monitoring.

Abstract: Forests play a critical role in global ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration. Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GC-4DGS enhances dynamic Gaussian Splatting by integrating geometric consistency for high-quality rendering from sparse views, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse input views degrade dynamic Gaussian Splatting performance; GC-4DGS addresses this limitation.

Method: Uses dynamic consistency checking and global-local depth regularization to integrate MVS and MDEs with 4DGS.

Result: Outperforms RF-DeRF and 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, validated on N3DV and Technicolor datasets.

Conclusion: GC-4DGS improves rendering quality for sparse views without compromising efficiency, suitable for IoT applications.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has been considered as a novel way for view synthesis of dynamic scenes, which shows great potential in AIoT applications such as digital twins. However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOATex is a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that addresses the challenge of occluded interiors, producing high-quality textures for both visible and hidden surfaces without costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to texture occluded interiors, leading to incomplete results and seams. GOATex aims to solve this by leveraging occlusion awareness and visibility layers.

Method: The method uses hit levels from multi-view ray casting to partition mesh faces into visibility layers. A two-stage strategy textures each layer with pretrained diffusion models, followed by UV-space blending for seamless merging.

Result: Empirical results show GOATex outperforms existing methods, creating seamless, high-fidelity textures without fine-tuning or manual intervention.

Conclusion: GOATex provides a superior solution for 3D mesh texturing, offering fine-grained control over layered appearances and handling both exterior and interior surfaces effectively.

Abstract: We present GOATex, a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces. While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

*Georgia Kanli,Daniele Perlo,Selma Boudissa,Radovan Jirik,Olivier Keunen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USArt is a dual sub-model deep learning method designed to recover high-quality MR images from under-sampled data while correcting noise and motion artefacts, achieving up to 5x acceleration without significant degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in simultaneously accelerating MR image acquisition and correcting artefacts from noise and motion, crucial for diagnostic accuracy.

Method: USArt employs a dual sub-model approach tailored for 2D brain anatomical images with Cartesian sampling, exploring under-sampling strategies and degradation levels.

Result: The model significantly improves SNR and contrast, with gradient under-sampling yielding the best results, achieving up to 5x acceleration and artefact correction.

Conclusion: USArt effectively combines acceleration and artefact correction, demonstrating robustness in real-world MRI settings.

Abstract: MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to quantify individual image contributions in NeRF-based 3D scene reconstructions, focusing on uneven utility due to varying image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data valuation is crucial in domains like XR and digital media, where not all images equally benefit scene reconstruction.

Method: The authors assess image contributions using reconstruction quality metrics (PSNR and MSE) and validate by removing low-contributing images during training.

Result: The method effectively identifies and removes low-quality images, improving reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: Quantifying image contributions enhances the efficiency and quality of NeRF-based reconstructions.

Abstract: Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.

*Hongye Zhu,Xuan Liu,Yanwen Ba,Jingye Xue,Shigeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REP introduces replay prompting with feature buffers and decoupling to improve multimodal model robustness against missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either synthesize missing modalities at high cost or ignore long-distance context, leading to performance drops.

Method: REP uses modality-wise feature buffers, private-shared decoupling, and dynamic initialization for stability.

Result: REP outperforms prior methods in missing-modality scenarios with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: REP is lightweight and effective for robust multimodal learning.

Abstract: Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The subjective diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and lack of high-quality images in clinical settings necessitate a reliable, fast diagnostic tool.

Method: ENSEL integrates multiple deep learning models via ensemble learning and tests using real-user images and randomly sampled disease images.

Result: ENSEL achieved high recall and processing speeds under 1s, demonstrating effectiveness in skin lesion detection.

Conclusion: ENSEL advances objective skin disease diagnosis and supports digital healthcare growth.

Abstract: The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text instructions alone lack precision for fine-grained image attribute control. NumeriKontrol addresses this gap by integrating numeric scales for accurate manipulation.

Method: The framework uses a Numeric Adapter to encode and inject numeric scales into diffusion models. It employs synthetic data (CAT dataset) from rendering engines and DSLR cameras for training.

Result: NumeriKontrol achieves accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across diverse editing scenarios, supporting zero-shot multi-condition edits.

Conclusion: NumeriKontrol advances instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable manipulation through numeric scales.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables intuitive manipulation through natural language commands. However, text instructions alone often lack the precision required for fine-grained control over edit intensity. We introduce NumeriKontrol, a framework that allows users to precisely adjust image attributes using continuous scalar values with common units. NumeriKontrol encodes numeric editing scales via an effective Numeric Adapter and injects them into diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Thanks to a task-separated design, our approach supports zero-shot multi-condition editing, allowing users to specify multiple instructions in any order. To provide high-quality supervision, we synthesize precise training data from reliable sources, including high-fidelity rendering engines and DSLR cameras. Our Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset covers diverse attribute manipulations with accurate ground-truth scales, enabling NumeriKontrol to function as a simple yet powerful interactive editing studio. Extensive experiments show that NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across a wide range of attribute editing scenarios. These contributions advance instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation.

TL;DR: Rectified MeanFlow (Re-MeanFlow) improves one-step sampling efficiency in flow-based generative models by modeling mean velocity along rectified trajectories, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of Rectified Flow and MeanFlow, which suffer from computational intensity, slow convergence, or noisy supervision.

Method: Proposes Re-MeanFlow, modeling mean velocity along rectified trajectories with one reflow step, and introduces a truncation heuristic.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in sample quality and training efficiency on ImageNet at multiple resolutions.

Conclusion: Re-MeanFlow offers a more efficient and effective approach for one-step generation in flow-based models.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance, yet sampling typically relies on expensive numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how much visual information aids reasoning in VLMs and disentangle it from linguistic priors.

Method: Developed MathSight, a benchmark with visual variants (original, hand-drawn, photo-captured) and text-only conditions for controlled comparison.

Result: Visual input's contribution decreases with problem difficulty; Qwen3-VL without images outperforms multimodal variants and GPT-5.

Conclusion: MathSight reveals VLMs often rely on linguistic priors, emphasizing the need for benchmarks to foster genuine vision-grounded reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. Yet, how much visual information truly contributes to reasoning remains unclear. Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique to address workload imbalance in scaled Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference caused by sparse attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequence parallelism methods struggle with workload imbalance due to varying sparsity across attention heads and irregular dense block distribution, hindering DiT inference efficiency.

Method: Proposes db-SP with dual-level partitioning (head and block levels) and dynamic allocation of parallel degrees to balance workloads adaptively.

Result: db-SP achieves a 1.25x end-to-end speedup and 1.40x attention-specific speedup over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: db-SP effectively resolves imbalance issues in sparse attention-based DiT inference, improving performance and scalability.

Abstract: Scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference via sequence parallelism is critical for reducing latency in visual generation, but is severely hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models employing block-wise sparse attention. The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACIEC, a method for image emotion classification using affective captions, addressing the 'affective gap' via hierarchical contrastive loss and chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving top results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'affective gap' limits pre-trained models' effectiveness in IEC. Language's variability and richness inspired leveraging pure texts for better emotion capture.

Method: ACIEC uses hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss for emotional concept detection, emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning for affective sentences, and pre-trained language models for IEC.

Result: The method bridges the affective gap, outperforms benchmarks, and handles images with embedded texts.

Conclusion: ACIEC effectively classifies image emotions using texts, surpassing previous approaches by addressing key limitations.

Abstract: Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.

Method: DNA-Prior integrates an implicit deep network prior with an explicit spectral-spatial prior (frequency-domain fidelity term and spatial regularisation) to form a dual-domain optimisation problem.

Result: Experiments show DNA-Prior effectively suppresses noise and preserves structure across various modalities and noise conditions.

Conclusion: DNA-Prior provides a robust, unsupervised solution for medical image denoising, adaptable to diverse clinical scenarios without needing training data.

Abstract: Medical imaging pipelines critically rely on robust denoising to stabilise downstream tasks such as segmentation and reconstruction. However, many existing denoisers depend on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, which restricts their usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data. To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning. Experiments across multiple modalities show that DNA achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCamCtrl is an end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation, addressing limitations in scene understanding and geometric awareness with a dual-branch framework and SIGMA mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness when representing camera poses as ray-based conditions.

Method: Introduces a dual-branch framework for camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences, along with the SIGMA mechanism for RGB-depth fusion.

Result: Achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation with a 40% reduction in camera motion errors compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: DualCamCtrl improves disentanglement of appearance and geometry modeling, demonstrating complementary roles of depth and camera poses in video generation.

Abstract: This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

*Yuheng Chen,Teng Hu,Jiangning Zhang,Zhucun Xue,Ran Yi,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstanceV proposes a video generation framework with instance-level control and global semantic consistency using innovative modules and achieves superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models lack fine-grained controllability, especially for instance-level attributes and spatial locations.

Method: Utilizes Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention for instance control, Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement for semantic consistency, and Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance to prevent small instance disappearance.

Result: InstanceV outperforms state-of-the-art models in both general video quality and instance-aware metrics.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances instance-level controllability and semantic consistency in video generation, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality videos conditioned on textual descriptions. However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

*Chaoyun Wang,Quanxin Huang,I-Chao Shen,Takeo Igarashi,Nanning Zheng,Caigui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a multi-stage framework for document rectification, addressing perspective, geometric, and fine-grained distortions. Enhanced metrics and extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to tackle real-world document rectification challenges caused by extreme camera perspectives and physical distortions by decomposing and progressively resolving complex transformations.

Method: The framework uses a coarse-to-fine approach: global affine transformation for perspective correction, rectification of geometric deformations, and iterative content-aware processes for fine distortions. Enhanced metrics (AED/ACER, AD-M/AAD-M) are introduced for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the AAD metric by 14.1%--34.7% and proving effective in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage framework and enhanced metrics effectively address document rectification challenges, setting new benchmarks for performance.

Abstract: Document rectification in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges due to extreme variations in camera perspectives and physical distortions. Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\%--34.7\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chaoyunwang/ArbDR.

*Jin-Seop Lee,SungJoon Lee,SeongJun Jung,Boyang Li,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to address the challenge of hard-irrelevant queries in Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), improving relevance discrimination and semantic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG models fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries, which are semantically similar but not actually relevant. This gap motivates the development of RA-RFT.

Method: RA-RFT uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and integrates four reward objectives (format, refuse-IoU, explain, query correction) to refine relevance discrimination and semantic reasoning.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness in various relevance-aware VTG scenarios and scalability across LVLM-based VTG models.

Conclusion: RA-RFT successfully addresses hard-irrelevant queries in VTG and is adaptable to multiple scenarios and models.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize a temporal segment in a video corresponding to a natural language query. However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.

*Masaki Kawamura,Nakamasa Inoue,Rintaro Yanagi,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PowerCLIP introduces powerset alignment and non-linear aggregators to enhance CLIP's compositional understanding, achieving better zero-shot performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive frameworks like CLIP struggle with compositional semantics spanning multiple image regions.

Method: PowerCLIP uses powerset alignment and NLAs to optimize region-to-phrase alignments, reducing computational cost exponentially.

Result: PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot tasks, proving its compositionality and robustness.

Conclusion: PowerCLIP effectively addresses compositional alignment challenges in vision-language pre-training.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach. Our code will be made publicly available.

### [174] [Fast Multi-view Consistent 3D Editing with Video Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23172)
*Liyi Chen,Ruihuang Li,Guowen Zhang,Pengfei Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViP3DE introduces a method using video generation models for efficient, high-quality 3D editing by leveraging temporal consistency priors, avoiding iterative updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven 3D editing methods suffer from inefficiency and over-smoothed results due to iterative multi-view updates.

Method: ViP3DE uses pre-trained video models to generate consistent multi-view edits in one pass, incorporating motion-preserved noise blending and geometry-aware denoising.

Result: ViP3DE achieves superior editing quality and speed compared to existing methods, as shown in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed ViP3DE framework effectively addresses the limitations of iterative editing, offering faster and higher-quality 3D results.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing enables user-friendly 3D object or scene editing with text instructions. Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

TL;DR: GeoWorld improves image-to-3D scene generation by using geometry models to enhance video frame consistency and reduce distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content in image-to-3D generation. GeoWorld aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Generates consecutive video frames first, then uses geometry models for full-frame features. Introduces geometry alignment loss and adaptation module.

Result: Produces high-fidelity 3D scenes from single images and camera trajectories, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: GeoWorld significantly enhances image-to-3D generation by leveraging richer geometric conditions and constraints.

Abstract: Previous works leveraging video models for image-to-3D scene generation tend to suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational resource needs of large pathology FMs, limiting their accessibility for research and clinical use.

Method: Multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning, evaluated on ten pathology benchmarks.

Result: Reduces model size by 86-92% with on-par performance, outperforming single-teacher models by 7% median accuracy margin.

Conclusion: Pathryoshka enables efficient local deployment of state-of-the-art pathology FMs without sacrificing accuracy or richness.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (FMs) have driven significant progress in computational pathology. However, these high-performing models can easily exceed a billion parameters and produce high-dimensional embeddings, thus limiting their applicability for research or clinical use when computing resources are tight. Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks. Compared to its much larger teachers, Pathryoshka reduces the model size by 86-92% at on-par performance. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-teacher distillation models of comparable size by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy. By enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology FMs for the broader research and clinical community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-stage visual inspection is crucial for Zero-Defect Manufacturing, but existing systems face challenges like complexity and data requirements. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: The framework compares real scenes to real-time Digital Twins in RGB-D space, leveraging object detection, pose estimation, and hierarchical annotation for defect detection. Benchmarking tools for DT creation are also evaluated.

Result: The framework achieves up to 63.3% IoU scores against ground-truth masks in an automotive use case, demonstrating effective defect detection under semi-controlled conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational insights for future research on low-data, generalizable defect detection methods in dynamic industrial environments.

Abstract: Early-stage visual quality inspection is vital for achieving Zero-Defect Manufacturing and minimizing production waste in modern industrial environments. However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.

TL;DR: The paper explores instruction tuning for improving LLMs' tabular data generation, achieving results comparable to GPT-4o with minimal data and compute resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on tabular QA/reasoning, neglecting tabular generation. The study addresses this gap and resource limitations.

Method: Created a high-quality instruction dataset and fine-tuned Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on 7K instructions using an A100 GPU (<6 hours).

Result: Achieved tabular generation performance matching GPT-4o despite limited resources.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning with quality data enables efficient LLM improvement for tabular generation.

Abstract: Tabular instruction tuning has emerged as a promising research direction for improving LLMs understanding of tabular data. However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance. Our experimental results show that by using our high-quality dataset and instruction-tuning on only 7K instructions with an A100 GPU, for less than 6 hours, we achieve tabular data generation performance on par with the most capable commercial LLM, GPT-4o.

*Shouhe Zhang,Dayong Ren,Sensen Song,Wenjie Li,Piaopiao Yu,Yurong Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the idea that rendering quality is key for tracking accuracy in 3DGS-SLAM, proposing a smooth kernel strategy (CB-KNN) to enhance robustness against parameter errors instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve camera pose tracking stability by focusing on rasterization robustness rather than perfect scene representation.

Method: Introduces CB-KNN, which adaptively smooths local rendering by adjusting RGB values and locations of neighboring Gaussians.

Result: CB-KNN improves tracking robustness and accuracy while maintaining scene reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Prioritizing rasterization resilience over rendering perfection enhances SLAM performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional notion in 3DGS-SLAM that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy. We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.

Motivation: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests is hindered by complex backgrounds, variable lighting, and occlusions, leading to missed detections and false positives.

Method: DAONet-YOLOv8 introduces three improvements: Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM), occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead), and C2f-DSConv module for better feature extraction and boundary capture.

Result: DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, and 97.10% mAP@50, outperforming YOLOv8n significantly while reducing parameters by 16.7%.

Conclusion: The proposed DAONet-YOLOv8 surpasses existing models in accuracy and efficiency for tea leaf pest detection in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%. Comparative experiments further confirm that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves superior performance over mainstream detection models.

TL;DR: PointCNN++ bridges the gap between point-based and voxel-based 3D point cloud learning, achieving high precision and performance through native point-centric convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either lose geometric precision (voxel-based) or suffer performance issues (point-based), hindering tasks like point cloud registration.

Method: Introduces point-centric convolution with receptive fields on high-precision points and optimizes it via Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) on GPU.

Result: PointCNN++ is memory-efficient, faster, and improves registration accuracy compared to voxel-based methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that high fidelity and efficiency in 3D learning are achievable, advancing the field.

Abstract: Existing convolutional learning methods for 3D point cloud data are divided into two paradigms: point-based methods that preserve geometric precision but often face performance challenges, and voxel-based methods that achieve high efficiency through quantization at the cost of geometric fidelity. This loss of precision is a critical bottleneck for tasks such as point cloud registration. We propose PointCNN++, a novel architectural design that fundamentally mitigates this precision-performance trade-off. It \textbf{generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points}, treating voxel-based convolution as a specialized, degraded case of our more general point-based convolution. First, we introduce a point-centric convolution where the receptive field is centered on the original, high-precision point coordinates. Second, to make this high-fidelity operation performant, we design a computational strategy that operates \textbf{natively} on points. We formulate the convolution on native points as a Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem, for which we develop a dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel. Experiments demonstrate that PointCNN++ \textbf{uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster} than representative point-based methods. Furthermore, when used as a simple replacement for the voxel-based backbones it generalizes, it \textbf{significantly improves point cloud registration accuracies while proving both more memory-efficient and faster}. PointCNN++ shows that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for a new class of 3D learning with high fidelity and efficiency. Our code will be open sourced.

Conclusion: SynthFun3D offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications, validated by its ability to replace or enhance real-world datasets.

Abstract: Functionality understanding in 3D, which aims to identify the functional element in a 3D scene to complete an action (e.g., the correct handle to "Open the second drawer of the cabinet near the bed"), is hindered by the scarcity of real-world data due to the substantial effort needed for its collection and annotation. To address this, we introduce SynthFun3D, the first method for task-based 3D scene synthesis. Given the action description, SynthFun3D generates a 3D indoor environment using a furniture asset database with part-level annotation, ensuring the action can be accomplished. It reasons about the action to automatically identify and retrieve the 3D mask of the correct functional element, enabling the inexpensive and large-scale generation of high-quality annotated data. We validate SynthFun3D through user studies, which demonstrate improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Our quantitative results further show that the generated data can either replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance, thereby providing an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MRRE, a training-free method to enhance multilingual reasoning in LLMs/LVLMs by injecting precomputed vectors during inference, improving performance in low-resource languages and maintaining language consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness concerns in multilingual applications due to LLMs' superior performance in English compared to low-resource languages.

Method: MRRE injects cross-lingual reasoning enhancement and target-language output anchoring vectors during inference without additional training.

Result: Average gain of 5.48% in non-English reasoning (up to 7.54% in Thai/Swahili) and 3.78% improvement in language consistency.

Conclusion: MRRE effectively enhances multilingual reasoning capabilities fairly and efficiently without extra resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, yet their performance in English significantly outperforms that in low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns in multilingual applications. Existing approaches either rely on costly multilingual training or employ prompting with external translation tools, both of which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques for synthetic data generation in industrial and robotics settings, finding simpler methods like perceptual hashing outperform complex GenAI approaches in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing data generation and annotation costs in machine learning deployments, leveraging synthetic data without manual intervention.

Method: Evaluation of DR and DA techniques, including feature-based methods, GenAI, and classical rendering, focusing on feature alignment and controlled diffusion-based DA.

Result: Simpler methods (e.g., perceptual hashing) outperform GenAI in accuracy (98% mAP50 industrial, 67% mAP50 robotics) and efficiency, with GenAI showing no significant improvement.

Conclusion: Efficient sim-to-real gap bridging is achievable with simpler synthetic data methods, enabling high real-world performance without complex GenAI overhead.

Abstract: Reducing the burden of data generation and annotation remains a major challenge for the cost-effective deployment of machine learning in industrial and robotics settings. While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.

*Tianhao Xie,Linlian Jiang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Tiberiu Popa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FACT-GS improves Gaussian Splatting by aligning texture sampling density with local visual frequency, enhancing detail retention without sacrificing real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current texture-based Gaussians use uniform sampling grids, causing inefficient texture space utilization and blurred details in high-frequency regions.

Method: FACT-GS introduces a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy via a deformation field, optimizing sampling density adaptively.

Result: The framework preserves real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.

Conclusion: FACT-GS offers a more efficient and effective approach to realistic scene appearance modeling by addressing sampling inefficiencies.

Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a variational method for color contrast enhancement inspired by human color vision, reducing computational cost from O(N²) to O(N log N).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in characterizing existing color correction models in terms of image features like contrast and dispersion, the study draws inspiration from human color vision phenomenology.

Method: The authors develop a variational formulation for color contrast enhancement, identifying perceptually inspired energy functionals. They propose three specific functionals and use gradient descent to find their minima. Additionally, they introduce a method to reduce computational cost.

Result: The study identifies explicit functionals for perceptually inspired color enhancement and demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement from O(N²) to O(N log N).

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges human color perception phenomenology with practical color correction algorithms, offering computational efficiency and perceptual relevance.

Abstract: Basic phenomenology of human color vision has been widely taken as an inspiration to devise explicit color correction algorithms. The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.

Conclusion: GeoRS advances instruction-driven segmentation with scalable data and a unified framework, enabling better generalization.

Abstract: Instruction-driven segmentation in remote sensing generates masks from guidance, offering great potential for accessible and generalizable applications. However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

*Yu Zhang,Jingyi Liu,Yiwei Shi,Qi Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Changwei Wang,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Markov-VAR improves efficiency and performance of Visual AutoRegressive modeling by replacing full-context dependency with a non-full-context Markov process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-context dependency in VAR models causes computational inefficiency and high overhead, limiting practicality and scalability.

Method: Reformulates VAR as a Markov process with Markovian Scale Prediction, using a sliding window to compress previous scales into a history vector.

Result: Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% and peak memory consumption by 83.8% compared to VAR.

Conclusion: Markov-VAR is a simpler, more efficient alternative to VAR, suitable for future research in visual autoregressive generation.

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) based on next-scale prediction has revitalized autoregressive visual generation. Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\times$ 1024). We believe that Markov-VAR can serve as a foundation for future research on visual autoregressive generation and other downstream tasks.

TL;DR: A computer vision-based pipeline is proposed to digitize vital sign data from standalone bedside monitors in low-resource healthcare settings, achieving high accuracy without costly hardware upgrades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of network connectivity in legacy bedside monitors creates interoperability gaps, hindering EHR integration. This solution avoids expensive hardware replacement.

Method: Uses YOLOv11 for monitor and ROI localization, PaddleOCR for text extraction, and geometric rectification for reliability under varying conditions.

Result: Achieved 99.5% mAP@50-95 for monitor detection, 91.5% for ROI localization, and 98.9% end-to-end extraction accuracy for key parameters.

Conclusion: The lightweight, camera-based method reliably converts unstructured screen data into structured EHR-compatible information, scalable for low-resource settings.

Abstract: In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: A scalable simulation framework (SimScale) synthesizes diverse driving scenarios to improve autonomous driving policies, achieving significant performance boosts (+6.8 EPDMS on navhard, +2.9 on navtest) through co-training on real and simulated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems need diverse, underrepresented scenarios (e.g., safety-critical ones) for robust decision-making, but real-world data lacks such diversity.

Method: Introduces a simulation framework using neural rendering and reactive environments to generate high-fidelity, multi-view observations and pseudo-expert trajectories for supervision. Co-trains policies on real and simulated data.

Result: Significant improvements in robustness and generalization (+6.8 EPDMS on navhard, +2.9 on navtest). Policy scaling works with simulation data alone.

Conclusion: SimScale enhances autonomous driving policies by leveraging synthetic data, revealing insights into pseudo-expert design and scaling properties.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving systems requires learning rational decisions in a wide span of scenarios, including safety-critical and out-of-distribution ones. However, such cases are underrepresented in real-world corpus collected by human experts. To complement for the lack of data diversity, we introduce a novel and scalable simulation framework capable of synthesizing massive unseen states upon existing driving logs. Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in. We further reveal several crucial findings of such a sim-real learning system, which we term SimScale, including the design of pseudo-experts and the scaling properties for different policy architectures. Our simulation data and code would be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack focus on diffusion-based edits, which blend smoothly into original content, necessitating a specialized dataset and method.

Method: The dataset was built using a multi-modal large language model for editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor for manipulations, and an active-learning pipeline for annotations. The proposed framework employs Visual Foundation Models and Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning.

Result: The method achieves pixel-level F1 scores of 82.56% on DEAL-300K and 80.97% on CoCoGlide, setting strong benchmarks for DIML.

Conclusion: DEAL-300K and the proposed framework provide a solid foundation for future research in diffusion-based image manipulation localization.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing has made semantic level image manipulation easy for general users, but it also enables realistic local forgeries that are hard to localize. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unifying multimodal understanding, generation, and reconstruction in a single tokenizer is challenging; VQRAE addresses this gap.

Method: VQRAE uses a Vector Quantization Representation AutoEncoder with a symmetric ViT decoder and two-stage training (encoder freezing and joint optimization).

Result: VQRAE achieves high benchmark performance in understanding, generation, and reconstruction, with a 100% utilization ratio for its semantic VQ codebook.

Conclusion: VQRAE successfully unifies multimodal tasks and demonstrates scalability for autoregressive paradigms.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing terrestrial-trained trackers fail underwater due to physics-driven degradations like wavelength attenuation and scattering.

Method: MANTA uses dual-positive contrastive learning with Beer-Lambert augmentations and a multi-stage pipeline combining motion-based tracking with physics-informed re-identification.

Result: MANTA improves Success AUC by up to 6% on four benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) and ensures stable long-term tracking.

Conclusion: MANTA effectively addresses underwater tracking challenges with physics-informed features and metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength dependent attenuation and scattering, which severely distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

TL;DR: DisMo introduces a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations from raw video data, enabling motion transfer across unrelated entities without object correspondences and outperforming state-of-the-art models in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V and I2V models lack explicit motion representation, limiting their utility for creators. DisMo addresses this gap to enable open-world motion transfer.

Method: DisMo learns motion representations via an image-space reconstruction objective, disentangling motion from appearance. It works with any video generator via lightweight adapters.

Result: DisMo achieves accurate motion transfer across unrelated categories and outperforms models like V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks.

Conclusion: DisMo's generic motion representation enhances motion transfer and understanding, compatible with future video generators and useful for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Motivation: Current generative game world models are limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, hindering diverse interactions.

Method: The model transforms unstructured text-video pairs into interactive datasets, leverages a 14B MoE foundation model, and uses a text-driven mechanism for fine-grained control.

Result: The model produces coherent, interactive game videos responding to free-form instructions (e.g., 'open the door'), validated via InterBench.

Conclusion: Hunyuan-GameCraft-2 advances generative game modeling by enabling flexible, instruction-driven interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".

TL;DR: The paper evaluates four data synthesis methods to improve object detection models for novel categories using limited object-centric data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of costly and time-consuming annotated data acquisition for extending object detection models to new classes, especially underrepresented ones.

Method: Four methods based on image processing, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models synthesize realistic images from object-centric data.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvements in category-level generalization for real-world data under data constraints.

Conclusion: Data synthesis methods effectively enhance object detection models when limited training data is available.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches to object detection have achieved reliable detection of specific object classes in images. However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether VLMs, optimized for multimodal understanding, inherently support visual generation tasks and reduce alignment costs.

Method: Introduces VGT-AE, aligning semantic encoders from VLMs with latent representations of pixel decoders, bypassing pixel-level VAEs.

Result: Achieves 26.67 PSNR, 0.50 rFID at 28x compression, and SOTA scores (0.77 GenEval, 78.73 DPG-Bench) in visual generation.

Conclusion: VGT demonstrates scalable, versatile potential for unifying multimodal understanding and generation in foundation models.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) effectively bridge the modality gap through extensive pretraining, acquiring sophisticated visual representations aligned with language. However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

TL;DR: AnyTalker is a multi-person video generation framework that uses an identity-aware attention mechanism and trains on single-person videos to achieve scalable and interactive results with low data costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven multi-person video generation methods face high data collection costs and challenges in driving multiple identities coherently.

Method: Proposes AnyTalker with an extensible multi-stream architecture and identity-aware attention mechanism, trained mainly on single-person videos and refined with minimal multi-person clips.

Result: AnyTalker achieves excellent lip sync, visual quality, and interactivity while balancing data costs and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses challenges in multi-person video generation, offering scalable and high-quality results with efficient data usage.

Abstract: Recently, multi-person video generation has started to gain prominence. While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.

*Hanoona Rasheed,Mohammed Zumri,Muhammad Maaz,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Interactive Video Reasoning introduces Video CoM, a model that actively interacts with videos via iterative visual actions, outperforming state-of-the-art models with fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs passively process videos as static contexts, limiting fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding. The paper aims to overcome this by enabling models to 'think with videos'.

Method: Video CoM uses Chain of Manipulations (CoM) for iterative visual actions, trained with supervised learning (18K Video CoM Instruct dataset) and reinforcement learning (reasoning-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization).

Result: Video CoM improves average performance by 3.6% over state-of-the-art models across nine benchmarks, training on fewer samples (25K SFT, 3K GRPO).

Conclusion: The active reasoning paradigm enhances accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating the potential of interactive video understanding.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses inconsistencies in reasoning over dynamic visual content by multimodal models, proposing metrics (TAC, VAS) to evaluate alignment and visual grounding, and introduces a reinforcement learning approach (GRPO with TAR) to improve temporal precision and reasoning consistency, resulting in higher performance (Video R2 model).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models generate reasoning traces that seem plausible but are often inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. This undermines trustworthiness and accuracy.

Method: Proposes TAC and VAS metrics to diagnose issues. Introduces a reinforcement learning approach combining timestamp-aware supervised fine-tuning and GRPO guided by TAR to enhance temporal alignment and reasoning coherence.

Result: Video R2 model achieves higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across benchmarks, showing improved temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to better performance.

Conclusion: Improving temporal alignment and reasoning coherence enhances model accuracy and trustworthiness in video understanding. The approach is validated across benchmarks, with plans to open-source resources.

Abstract: Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.

Motivation: Addressing persistent gaps in reproducibility, accessibility, and governance in NLP evaluation reporting.

Method: Surveying recent work and introducing EvalCards as a standardized tool for transparent reporting.

Result: Identified current reporting inadequacies and offered EvalCards as a solution.

Conclusion: EvalCards aim to enhance transparency and meet evolving governance needs in NLP evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluation has long been a central concern in NLP, and transparent reporting practices are more critical than ever in today's landscape of rapidly released open-access models. Drawing on a survey of recent work on evaluation and documentation, we identify three persistent shortcomings in current reporting practices: reproducibility, accessibility, and governance. We argue that existing standardization efforts remain insufficient and introduce Evaluation Disclosure Cards (EvalCards) as a path forward. EvalCards are designed to enhance transparency for both researchers and practitioners while providing a practical foundation to meet emerging governance requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GEC systems lack diverse references, leading to underestimated evaluations and limited model generalization.

Method: JELV uses human-annotated PEVData and offers two implementations: a multi-turn LLM pipeline and a distilled DeBERTa classifier. It reclassifies false positives and integrates fluency scoring for evaluation.

Result: JELV achieves 90% agreement with humans (LLM) and 85% precision (DeBERTa), improves evaluation metrics, and boosts GEC model performance via expanded datasets.

Conclusion: JELV enhances reference diversity, evaluation robustness, and model generalization in GEC systems.

Abstract: Existing Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems suffer from limited reference diversity, leading to underestimated evaluation and restricted model generalization. To address this issue, we introduce the Judge of Edit-Level Validity (JELV), an automated framework to validate correction edits from grammaticality, faithfulness, and fluency. Using our proposed human-annotated Pair-wise Edit-level Validity Dataset (PEVData) as benchmark, JELV offers two implementations: a multi-turn LLM-as-Judges pipeline achieving 90% agreement with human annotators, and a distilled DeBERTa classifier with 85% precision on valid edits. We then apply JELV to reclassify misjudged false positives in evaluation and derive a comprehensive evaluation metric by integrating false positive decoupling and fluency scoring, resulting in state-of-the-art correlation with human judgments. We also apply JELV to filter LLM-generated correction candidates, expanding the BEA19's single-reference dataset containing 38,692 source sentences. Retraining top GEC systems on this expanded dataset yields measurable performance gains. JELV provides a scalable solution for enhancing reference diversity and strengthening both evaluation and model generalization.

Motivation: Assess LLM capabilities in specialized medical contexts for education and clinical support.

Method: Evaluated 27 LLMs on 2,800 curated medical questions across 7 specialties and 2 difficulty levels.

Result: Mixtral-8x7B performed best; smaller models sometimes outperformed larger ones. Performance varied by specialty.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise but have limitations in specialized medical applications; benchmarks aid deployment decisions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has prompted significant interest in their potential applications in medical domains. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on Chinese medical examination questions, encompassing seven medical specialties across two professional levels. We introduce a robust evaluation framework that assesses model performance on 2,800 carefully curated questions from cardiovascular, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, and respiratory medicine domains. Our dataset distinguishes between attending physician and senior physician difficulty levels, providing nuanced insights into model capabilities across varying complexity. Our empirical analysis reveals substantial performance variations among models, with Mixtral-8x7B achieving the highest overall accuracy of 74.25%, followed by DeepSeek-R1-671B at 64.07%. Notably, we observe no consistent correlation between model size and performance, as evidenced by the strong performance of smaller mixture-of-experts architectures. The evaluation demonstrates significant performance gaps between medical specialties, with models generally performing better on cardiovascular and neurology questions compared to gastroenterology and nephrology domains. Furthermore, our analysis indicates minimal performance degradation between attending and senior physician levels for top-performing models, suggesting robust generalization capabilities. This benchmark provides critical insights for the deployment of LLMs in medical education and clinical decision support systems, highlighting both the promise and current limitations of these technologies in specialized medical contexts.

*Siyaxolisa Kabane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares generalization capabilities of LLM-based vs non-LLM text embeddings, focusing on SLERP merging’s role in mitigating over-specialization from task-specific adaptation like LoRA. Experiments show LLMs capture higher-order patterns better but suffer from adapter dominance; SLERP merging improves generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLM-based embeddings generalize compared to non-LLM encoders and evaluate SLERP merging’s effectiveness in addressing over-specialization from task-specific adaptations.

Method: A controlled experiment embedding short numerical sequences, comparing four model families (non-LLM, LLM with LoRA, LLM with LoRA and model souping, LLM with LoRA and SLERP). Representational quality assessed via clustering indices and kmeans labels.

Result: LLM-based embeddings better capture compositional patterns but suffer from adapter dominance. SLERP merging retains task gains while recovering base-model structure, outperforming other merging methods in cluster separability and robustness.

Conclusion: SLERP merging effectively mitigates over-specialization in LLM-based embeddings, offering superior generalization tradeoffs compared to model souping or non-merged models.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization properties of dense text embeddings when the embedding backbone is a large language model (LLM) versus when it is a non-LLM encoder, and we study the extent to which spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) model-merging mitigates over-specialization introduced by task-specific adaptation (e.g., LoRA). To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged.

*Jonatas Grosman,Cassio Almeida,Guilherme Schardong,Hélio Lopes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how wav2vec2-based pre-trained models transfer knowledge across languages, finding that data diversity during pre-training matters more than size, and that performance varies by language family.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand cross-lingual transferability of wav2vec2-based models, especially when target languages differ from pre-training languages.

Method: Fine-tuning experiments on speech recognition tasks in 18 languages using 15 pre-trained models.

Result: Data diversity outperforms size in pre-training; Indo-European languages perform better; positive cross-lingual transfer observed, especially with linguistically similar languages.

Conclusion: Findings help guide efficient use of existing wav2vec2-based models and inform future pre-training strategies.

Abstract: Using representations provided by a large pre-trained model has become the primary strategy for achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks. A recently proposed large pre-trained model, wav2vec 2.0, was seminal for several other works on pre-training large models on speech data. Many models are being pre-trained using the same architecture as wav2vec 2.0 and are getting state-of-the-art in various speech-related tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that the data used during the pre-training of these wav2vec2-based models can impact the model's performance in downstream tasks, and this should be taken into consideration before utilizing these models. However, few works have proposed investigating further how the transfer knowledge of these pre-trained models behaves in different languages, even when the target language differs from the one used during the model's pre-training. Our work aims to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of these wav2vec2-based models. We performed several fine-tuning experiments on the speech recognition task in 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained models. The results of our experiments showed us that the size of data used during the pre-training of these models is not as important to the final performance as the diversity. We noticed that the performance of Indo-European languages is superior to non-Indo-European languages in the evaluated models. We have observed a positive cross-lingual transfer of knowledge using monolingual models, which was evident in all the languages we used, but more pronounced when the language used during pre-training was more similar to the downstream task language. With these findings, we aim to assist the scientific community in utilizing existing wav2vec2-based pre-trained models, as well as facilitate the pre-training of new ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Insight-A uses MLLMs to detect and attribute multimodal misinformation by leveraging cross-attribution prompting and automatic debiased prompting, enhancing consistency across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated misinformation threatens societal safety, but current methods ignore attribution. Insight-A addresses this gap.

Method: Uses cross-attribution prompting (CAP) for forgery source attribution and automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) to reduce human bias. Also employs image captioning for cross-modal checks.

Result: Extensive experiments show Insight-A's superiority, offering a new paradigm for misinformation detection.

Conclusion: Insight-A effectively detects and attributes misinformation, improving cross-modal consistency in the AIGC era.

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has emerged as a prevalent alternative to create multimodal misinformation on social media platforms, posing unprecedented threats to societal safety. However, standard prompting leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify the emerging misinformation, which ignores the misinformation attribution. To this end, we present Insight-A, exploring attribution with MLLM insights for detecting multimodal misinformation. Insight-A makes two efforts: I) attribute misinformation to forgery sources, and II) an effective pipeline with hierarchical reasoning that detects distortions across modalities. Specifically, to attribute misinformation to forgery traces based on generation patterns, we devise cross-attribution prompting (CAP) to model the sophisticated correlations between perception and reasoning. Meanwhile, to reduce the subjectivity of human-annotated prompts, automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) is used for task adaptation on MLLMs. Additionally, we design image captioning (IC) to achieve visual details for enhancing cross-modal consistency checking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposal and provide a new paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection in the era of AIGC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NRPA-GD introduces a novel goal-oriented dialogue method using nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation with LLMs, outperforming existing approaches without specific model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal-oriented dialogue methods rely on prompt engineering or costly pre-trained models, which are hard to adapt. NRPA-GD aims to avoid these limitations.

Method: NRPA-GD uses an LLM to simulate user and system behaviors, employs nested Monte Carlo simulation, and dynamically adjusts policies.

Result: NRPA-GD outperforms prompt engineering and pre-trained models on four datasets, even surpassing ChatGPT with a smaller LLM.

Conclusion: NRPA-GD demonstrates the effectiveness of planning methods with LLMs for practical dialogue tasks, offering adaptability and efficiency.

Abstract: In goal-oriented dialogue tasks, the main challenge is to steer the interaction towards a given goal within a limited number of turns. Existing approaches either rely on elaborate prompt engineering, whose effectiveness is heavily dependent on human experience, or integrate policy networks and pre-trained policy models, which are usually difficult to adapt to new dialogue scenarios and costly to train. Therefore, in this paper, we present Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Goal-oriented Dialogue (NRPA-GD), a novel dialogue policy planning method that completely avoids specific model training by utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate behaviors of user and system at the same time. Specifically, NRPA-GD constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework of nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process. The experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show that NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and specifically pre-trained model-based methods. Impressively, NRPA-GD surpasses ChatGPT and pre-trained policy models with only a 0.6-billion-parameter LLM. The proposed approach further demonstrates the advantages and novelty of employing planning methods on LLMs to solve practical planning tasks.

Result: The paper provides insights into LLMs' capabilities in data preparation tasks and contrasts them with traditional methods.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in automating data preparation tasks, offering potential advantages over traditional tools.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated their exceptional capabilities in supporting and automating various tasks. Among the tasks worth exploring for testing large language model capabilities, we considered data preparation, a critical yet often labor-intensive step in data-driven processes. This paper investigates whether large language models can effectively support users in selecting and automating data preparation tasks. To this aim, we considered both general-purpose and fine-tuned tabular large language models. We prompted these models with poor-quality datasets and measured their ability to perform tasks such as data profiling and cleaning. We also compare the support provided by large language models with that offered by traditional data preparation tools. To evaluate the capabilities of large language models, we developed a custom-designed quality model that has been validated through a user study to gain insights into practitioners' expectations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new metric (PBM) and methods (BaQCKV, LoRA-1) to address selection bias in MCQ evaluations for LLMs, improving consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCQ evaluation methods for LLMs suffer from selection bias and computational inefficiency, requiring labeled data and lacking generalization.

Method: Proposes PBM for unsupervised bias measurement, BaQCKV for efficient majority voting, and LoRA-1 fine-tuning to mitigate bias without heavy computation.

Result: Experiments show reduced bias and improved accuracy consistency across MCQ benchmarks with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively mitigate selection bias in LLM MCQ evaluations, offering scalable and unsupervised solutions.

Abstract: Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) answering is a widely used method for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LLMs often exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks, where their choices are influenced by factors like answer position or option symbols rather than the content. This bias undermines the reliability of MCQ as an evaluation framework. Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability. Experiments across multiple MCQ benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches reduce bias, increasing consistency in accuracy while minimizing computational costs.

*Fatima Kazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluates them using benchmarks, and proposes methods like fine-tuning to mitigate biases. Results show mixed performance in handling biases, with improvements up to 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs like ChatGPT become widely used, their inherited biases from training data pose risks of spreading harmful stereotypes. This study aims to identify, analyze, and mitigate these biases to ensure fair AI outputs.

Method: The study uses benchmarks (StereoSet, CrowSPairs) to evaluate biases in models like BERT and GPT 3.5. A three-pronged approach detects explicit and implicit biases. Enhancement strategies include fine-tuning, prompting techniques, and data augmentation.

Result: Fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but handle racial biases well. LLMs often rely too much on prompt keywords, lacking deeper understanding. Enhancement methods improved implicit bias performance by up to 20%.

Conclusion: Addressing biases in LLMs is critical for fairness. While current methods show promise, further research is needed to improve model adaptability and reduce reliance on superficial cues.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have gained popularity in recent years with the advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with use cases spanning many disciplines and daily lives as well. LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

TL;DR: EulerESG is an LLM-powered system designed to automate ESG disclosure analysis, leveraging dual-channel retrieval and interactive tools for high-fidelity reporting aligned with ESG standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ESG reports are complex and heterogeneous, making systematic analysis challenging. Existing tools lack explicit modeling of ESG frameworks.

Method: Combines dual-channel retrieval with LLM-driven analysis, an interactive dashboard, and chatbot for exploration, benchmarking, and explanation.

Result: Achieves high fidelity (up to 0.95 average accuracy) in populating standard-aligned metric tables efficiently.

Conclusion: EulerESG proves effective for ESG disclosure analysis, leveraging LLMs and interactive features for practical use.

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports have become central to how companies communicate climate risk, social impact, and governance practices, yet they are still published primarily as long, heterogeneous PDF documents. This makes it difficult to systematically answer seemingly simple questions. Existing tools either rely on brittle rule-based extraction or treat ESG reports as generic text, without explicitly modelling the underlying reporting standards. We present \textbf{EulerESG}, an LLM-powered system for automating ESG disclosure analysis with explicit awareness of ESG frameworks. EulerESG combines (i) dual-channel retrieval and LLM-driven disclosure analysis over ESG reports, and (ii) an interactive dashboard and chatbot for exploration, benchmarking, and explanation. Using four globally recognised companies and twelve SASB sub-industries, we show that EulerESG can automatically populate standard-aligned metric tables with high fidelity (up to 0.95 average accuracy) while remaining practical in end-to-end runtime, and we compare several recent LLM models in this setting. The full implementation, together with a demonstration video, is publicly available at https://github.com/UNSW-database/EulerESG.

*Shabbir Anees,Anshuman,Ayush Chaurasia,Prathmesh Bogar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced machine-learning system to detect AI-generated fraudulent reviews with high accuracy, using text preprocessing, HHO for feature selection, and ensemble classifiers, achieving strong performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fraudulent reviews undermine online shopping trust, and AI-generated reviews pose a new challenge. This work aims to address this issue with advanced ML techniques.

Method: The approach combines text preprocessing, multi-modal feature extraction, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) for feature selection, and a stacking ensemble classifier, tested on 40,432 reviews.

Result: HHO reduced features by 89.9%, and the stacking model achieved 95.40% accuracy, 92.81% precision, 95.01% recall, and 93.90% F1-Score.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning with bio-inspired optimization effectively detects AI-generated reviews, with privacy-preserving techniques recommended for cloud-based analytics.

Abstract: It is well known that fraudulent reviews cast doubt on the legitimacy and dependability of online purchases. The most recent development that leads customers towards darkness is the appearance of human reviews in computer-generated (CG) ones. In this work, we present an advanced machine-learning-based system that analyses these reviews produced by AI with remarkable precision. Our method integrates advanced text preprocessing, multi-modal feature extraction, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) for feature selection, and a stacking ensemble classifier. We implemented this methodology on a public dataset of 40,432 Original (OR) and Computer-Generated (CG) reviews. From an initial set of 13,539 features, HHO selected the most applicable 1,368 features, achieving an 89.9% dimensionality reduction. Our final stacking model achieved 95.40% accuracy, 92.81% precision, 95.01% recall, and a 93.90% F1-Score, which demonstrates that the combination of ensemble learning and bio-inspired optimisation is an effective method for machine-generated text recognition. Because large-scale review analytics commonly run on cloud platforms, privacy-preserving techniques such as differential approaches and secure outsourcing are essential to protect user data in these systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrossCheck-Bench is a benchmark evaluating multimodal models' ability to detect contradictions in real-world scenarios, revealing gaps in logical reasoning despite strong perceptual matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess multimodal models' capability in resolving inconsistencies between visual and textual cues, beyond simple alignment tasks.

Method: Developed CrossCheck-Bench with 15k QA pairs involving synthetic contradictions, covering three reasoning levels and seven atomic capabilities. Expert annotations ensured semantic validity and difficulty calibration.

Result: Models perform well on perceptual tasks but struggle with logical contradiction detection, showing uneven skill acquisition and limited gains from conventional prompting. Symbolic reasoning + visual processing improves performance.

Conclusion: Multimodal models face a reasoning bottleneck; integrating symbolic reasoning with visual processing can enhance robustness in cross-modal verification.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are primarily trained and evaluated on aligned image-text pairs, which leaves their ability to detect and resolve real-world inconsistencies largely unexplored. In open-domain applications visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring models to perform structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment. We introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating contradiction detection in multimodal inputs. The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification.

*Zhaoxin Zhang,Borui Chen,Yiming Hu,Youyang Qu,Tianqing Zhu,Longxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MICM is a new jailbreak method targeting LLMs' value structures, outperforming existing techniques by exploiting abstract generalization and bypassing safety filters without overt triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM jailbreak methods focus on overtly harmful outputs, ignoring attacks that manipulate implicit values. This gap leaves models vulnerable to covert exploitation.

Method: MICM uses conceptual morphology theory to encode nuanced concepts into prompts via predefined phrases. These trigger specific value stances without activating safety filters.

Result: MICM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques across five advanced LLMs, achieving high success rates with minimal rejection.

Conclusion: Commercial LLMs' safety mechanisms are vulnerable to covert manipulation of value alignment, highlighting a critical blind spot in current strategies.

Abstract: Recent research on large language model (LLM) jailbreaks has primarily focused on techniques that bypass safety mechanisms to elicit overtly harmful outputs. However, such efforts often overlook attacks that exploit the model's capacity for abstract generalization, creating a critical blind spot in current alignment strategies. This gap enables adversaries to induce objectionable content by subtly manipulating the implicit social values embedded in model outputs. In this paper, we introduce MICM, a novel, model-agnostic jailbreak method that targets the aggregate value structure reflected in LLM responses. Drawing on conceptual morphology theory, MICM encodes specific configurations of nuanced concepts into a fixed prompt template through a predefined set of phrases. These phrases act as conceptual triggers, steering model outputs toward a specific value stance without triggering conventional safety filters. We evaluate MICM across five advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen3-8B. Experimental results show that MICM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving high success rates with minimal rejection. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in commercial LLMs: their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to covert manipulation of underlying value alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges faced by peer-run behavioral health organizations (PROs) due to limited funds and staffing by assisting peer providers in their daily tasks.

Method: Developed PeerCoPilot, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline backed by a database of 1,300 vetted resources, and conducted human evaluations with 15 peer providers and 6 service users.

Result: Over 90% of users supported PeerCoPilot, which provided more reliable and specific information than a baseline LLM. Currently used by 5-10 peer providers serving over 10,000 users.

Conclusion: PeerCoPilot effectively supports peer providers in PROs, demonstrating reliability and user approval, with ongoing expansion efforts.

Abstract: Behavioral health conditions, which include mental health and substance use disorders, are the leading disease burden in the United States. Peer-run behavioral health organizations (PROs) critically assist individuals facing these conditions by combining mental health services with assistance for needs such as income, employment, and housing. However, limited funds and staffing make it difficult for PROs to address all service user needs. To assist peer providers at PROs with their day-to-day tasks, we introduce PeerCoPilot, a large language model (LLM)-powered assistant that helps peer providers create wellness plans, construct step-by-step goals, and locate organizational resources to support these goals. PeerCoPilot ensures information reliability through a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline backed by a large database of over 1,300 vetted resources. We conducted human evaluations with 15 peer providers and 6 service users and found that over 90% of users supported using PeerCoPilot. Moreover, we demonstrated that PeerCoPilot provides more reliable and specific information than a baseline LLM. PeerCoPilot is now used by a group of 5-10 peer providers at CSPNJ, a large behavioral health organization serving over 10,000 service users, and we are actively expanding PeerCoPilot's use.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the German General Personas (GGP) collection, a resource for persona prompting in LLMs, built from the ALLBUS survey to improve accuracy in simulating human perspectives. It evaluates GGP's effectiveness and explores factors influencing alignment with population responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing persona collections for LLMs lack empirical grounding, limiting accurate simulations of human perspectives in computational social science.

Method: The GGP collection is developed from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) and tested by prompting LLMs to simulate survey responses, comparing results with classifiers.

Result: GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers in simulating survey responses, especially under data scarcity. Representativity and attribute selection in persona prompts significantly impact alignment with population responses.

Conclusion: GGP is a valuable resource for LLM-based social simulations, enabling systematic exploration of persona prompting in NLP and social science research.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human perspectives via persona prompting is gaining traction in computational social science. However, well-curated, empirically grounded persona collections remain scarce, limiting the accuracy and representativeness of such simulations. Here we introduce the German General Personas (GGP) collection, a comprehensive and representative persona prompt collection built from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). The GGP and its persona prompts are designed to be easily plugged into prompts for all types of LLMs and tasks, steering models to generate responses aligned with the underlying German population. We evaluate GGP by prompting various LLMs to simulate survey response distributions across diverse topics, demonstrating that GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers, particularly under data scarcity. Furthermore, we analyze how the representativity and attribute selection within persona prompts affect alignment with population responses. Our findings suggest that GGP provides a potentially valuable resource for research on LLM-based social simulations that enables more systematic explorations of population-aligned persona prompting in NLP and social science research.

TL;DR: AD-CDO is a lightweight ontology standardizing AD clinical trial eligibility criteria, achieving 63% concept coverage and supporting applications like trial simulation and EHR integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for standardized representation of eligibility criteria in AD clinical trials, bridging gaps between broad biomedical ontologies and trial-specific needs.

Method: Extracted high-frequency concepts from 1,500+ AD trials, organized into semantic categories, annotated with biomedical vocabularies, and optimized using Jenks Natural Breaks.

Result: AD-CDO covered 63% of trial concepts, enabled trial simulation and entity normalization, and supported integration with EHR data.

Conclusion: AD-CDO offers a versatile foundation for ontology-driven AD clinical trial research by harmonizing eligibility criteria with standardized vocabularies.

Abstract: Objective
  This study introduces the Alzheimer's Disease Common Data Element Ontology for Clinical Trials (AD-CDO), a lightweight, semantically enriched ontology designed to represent and standardize key eligibility criteria concepts in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials.
  Materials and Methods
  We extracted high-frequency concepts from more than 1,500 AD clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and organized them into seven semantic categories: Disease, Medication, Diagnostic Test, Procedure, Social Determinants of Health, Rating Criteria, and Fertility. Each concept was annotated with standard biomedical vocabularies, including the UMLS, OMOP Standardized Vocabularies, DrugBank, NDC, and NLM VSAC value sets. To balance coverage and manageability, we applied the Jenks Natural Breaks method to identify an optimal set of representative concepts.
  Results
  The optimized AD-CDO achieved over 63% coverage of extracted trial concepts while maintaining interpretability and compactness. The ontology effectively captured the most frequent and clinically meaningful entities used in AD eligibility criteria. We demonstrated AD-CDO's practical utility through two use cases: (a) an ontology-driven trial simulation system for formal modeling and virtual execution of clinical trials, and (b) an entity normalization task mapping raw clinical text to ontology-aligned terms, enabling consistency and integration with EHR data.
  Discussion
  AD-CDO bridges the gap between broad biomedical ontologies and task-specific trial modeling needs. It supports multiple downstream applications, including phenotyping algorithm development, cohort identification, and structured data integration.
  Conclusion
  By harmonizing essential eligibility entities and aligning them with standardized vocabularies, AD-CDO provides a versatile foundation for ontology-driven AD clinical trial research.

*Yizhou Xu,Janet Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptTailor is a system that generates intent-aligned prompts for lightweight language models to improve response quality without requiring expert input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight models are sensitive to prompt quality, and non-expert users often struggle to craft effective prompts. PromptTailor addresses this by aligning prompts with user intent.

Method: PromptTailor uses a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with LoRA on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues distilled from stronger LLMs.

Result: It outperforms chain-of-thought prompting and matches state-of-the-art methods with fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9).

Conclusion: A compact model guided by stronger teachers can learn effective prompt-generation strategies while maintaining user intent alignment.

Abstract: Lightweight language models remain attractive for on-device and privacy-sensitive applications, but their responses are highly sensitive to prompt quality. For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9). These results show that a compact student, guided by powerful teachers, can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent.

TL;DR: SUMER introduces a reinforcement learning agent that uses search tools on raw data to outperform biased memory compression methods in long-context tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory frameworks in LLMs incorporate human bias through optimized prompts and architectures, limiting generalization. SUMER explores uncompressed data search for superior performance.

Method: SUMER employs end-to-end reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to learn search tool usage for answering questions without data compression.

Result: On the LoCoMo dataset, SUMER outperformed biased compression methods and full-context baselines, achieving a 43% performance gain.

Conclusion: Searching raw data surpasses biased compression methods, advocating for dynamic and scalable paradigms in long-context memory benchmarks.

Abstract: How to enable human-like long-term memory in large language models (LLMs) has been a central question for unlocking more general capabilities such as few-shot generalization. Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions. Here we present SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay), an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information and answer a target question. On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct learned to use search tools and outperformed all other biased memory compression approaches and also the full-context baseline, reaching SOTA performance (43% gain over the prior best). We demonstrate that a simple search method applied to raw data outperforms goal-agnostic and biased compression algorithms in current long-context memory tasks, arguing for new paradigms and benchmarks that are more dynamic and autonomously scalable. Code for SUMER and all implemented baselines is publicly available at https://github.com/zycyc/SUMER.

TL;DR: AffectMind is a multimodal affective dialogue agent designed for emotionally rich marketing conversations, combining proactive reasoning and dynamic knowledge grounding to outperform LLM-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based dialogue systems are reactive and struggle in emotionally rich, goal-oriented settings like marketing conversations. AffectMind addresses this by integrating emotional alignment and proactive reasoning.

Method: AffectMind uses three components: Proactive Knowledge Grounding Network (PKGN), Emotion--Intent Alignment Model (EIAM), and Reinforced Discourse Loop (RDL) to dynamically adapt interactions based on user emotion and intent.

Result: Experiments show AffectMind outperforms baselines in emotional consistency (+26%), persuasive success rate (+19%), and user engagement (+23%).

Conclusion: AffectMind demonstrates that emotion-grounded proactivity is crucial for effective commercial multimodal dialogue agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled fluent dialogue systems, but most remain reactive and struggle in emotionally rich, goal-oriented settings such as marketing conversations. To address this limitation, we propose AffectMind, a multimodal affective dialogue agent that performs proactive reasoning and dynamic knowledge grounding to sustain emotionally aligned and persuasive interactions. AffectMind combines three components: a Proactive Knowledge Grounding Network (PKGN) that continuously updates factual and affective context from text, vision, and prosody; an Emotion--Intent Alignment Model (EIAM) that jointly models user emotion and purchase intent to adapt persuasion strategies; and a Reinforced Discourse Loop (RDL) that optimizes emotional coherence and engagement via reinforcement signals from user responses. Experiments on two newly curated marketing dialogue datasets, MM-ConvMarket and AffectPromo, show that AffectMind outperforms strong LLM-based baselines in emotional consistency (+26\%), persuasive success rate (+19\%), and long-term user engagement (+23\%), highlighting emotion-grounded proactivity as a key capability for commercial multimodal agents.

*Jithin Krishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how components in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems interact, showing that combining enhancements like hybrid retrieval and adaptive thresholding reduces abstention significantly without increasing errors. It highlights the importance of standardized metrics and adaptive calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individual components in RAG systems interact and to improve reliability by integrating them synergistically rather than relying on isolated enhancements.

Method: Conducted ablation studies on 50 queries (answerable, edge cases, adversarial) to evaluate enhancements like hybrid retrieval, ensemble verification, and adaptive thresholding.

Result: Combined enhancements reduced abstention by 95% (from 40% to 2%) without increasing hallucinations. Identified measurement challenges due to inconsistent labeling.

Conclusion: Synergistic integration of components is more effective than isolated enhancements. Standardized metrics and adaptive calibration are crucial for accurate performance interpretation and preventing over-answering.

Abstract: Building reliable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems requires more than adding powerful components; it requires understanding how they interact. Using ablation studies on 50 queries (15 answerable, 10 edge cases, and 25 adversarial), we show that enhancements such as hybrid retrieval, ensemble verification, and adaptive thresholding provide almost no benefit when used in isolation, yet together achieve a 95% reduction in abstention (from 40% to 2%) without increasing hallucinations. We also identify a measurement challenge: different verification strategies can behave safely but assign inconsistent labels (for example, "abstained" versus "unsupported"), creating apparent hallucination rates that are actually artifacts of labeling. Our results show that synergistic integration matters more than the strength of any single component, that standardized metrics and labels are essential for correctly interpreting performance, and that adaptive calibration is needed to prevent overconfident over-answering even when retrieval quality is high.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate AI agents' ability to retrieve functionally equivalent procedures across novel contexts, revealing limitations in current embedding-based methods and highlighting the potential of LLM-generated abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents struggle with novel tasks involving unseen vocabularies, exposing a core limitation in procedural memory systems. The study aims to assess whether agents can recognize equivalent procedures despite differing object instantiations.

Method: Using ALFWorld, dual corpora of expert and LLM-generated trajectories are created. Six retrieval methods are evaluated with systematically stratified queries, including embedding-based approaches and LLM-generated procedural abstractions.

Result: Embedding-based methods degrade sharply on novel contexts, while LLM-generated abstractions show reliable cross-context transfer. Corpus scale outperforms representation enrichment, indicating architectural limits in current encoders.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a diagnostic framework to distinguish genuine procedural understanding from memorization, offering tools for developing retrieval systems with dependable generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Current AI agents excel in familiar settings, but fail sharply when faced with novel tasks with unseen vocabularies -- a core limitation of procedural memory systems. We present the first benchmark that isolates procedural memory retrieval from task execution, evaluating whether agents can recognize functionally equivalent procedures that span different object instantiations. Using ALFWorld, we construct dual corpora of expert and LLM-generated trajectories and evaluate six retrieval methods using systematically stratified queries. Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders. Our benchmark offers the first diagnostic framework separating genuine procedural understanding from surface-level memorization and gives tools for developing retrieval systems capable of dependable generalization.

TL;DR: LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini show quantum-like structures (e.g., entanglement, Bose-Einstein statistics) in conceptual combinations and linguistic distributions, mirroring human cognition. This suggests evolutionary convergence in knowledge organization between humans and AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs exhibit quantum-like structures in conceptual and linguistic tasks, similar to human cognition, and to propose a unifying framework for this phenomenon.

Method: Cognitive tests involving conceptual combinations and linguistic distributions were performed using ChatGPT and Gemini. The presence of quantum entanglement and Bose-Einstein statistics was analyzed.

Result: LLMs violated Bell's inequalities (indicating entanglement) and showed Bose-Einstein statistics in word distributions, aligning with human cognitive and linguistic tests.

Conclusion: The findings suggest evolutionary convergence in knowledge organization between humans and LLMs, pointing to a pervasive quantum structure in meaning across cognitive agents.

Abstract: We present the results of cognitive tests on conceptual combinations, performed using specific Large Language Models (LLMs) as test subjects. In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training. We analyze various aspects and examples that contain evidence supporting the above hypothesis. We also advance a unifying framework that explains the pervasive quantum organization of meaning that we identify.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoSA is a novel PEFT framework that enhances fine-tuning efficiency by targeting low-frequency RoPE-influenced attention states and dynamically selecting critical layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods lack consideration for distinct roles of model components and heterogeneous layer importance, limiting adaptation efficiency.

Method: RoSA uses RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) and Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) for targeted parameter allocation.

Result: RoSA outperforms mainstream PEFT methods on fifteen benchmarks with comparable trainable parameters.

Conclusion: RoSA provides a more efficient and targeted fine-tuning approach, improving adaptation in language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models is essential for task-specific adaptation, yet it remains computationally prohibitive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a solution, but current approaches typically ignore the distinct roles of model components and the heterogeneous importance across layers, thereby limiting adaptation efficiency. Motivated by the observation that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) induce critical activations in the low-frequency dimensions of attention states, we propose RoPE-aware Selective Adaptation (RoSA), a novel PEFT framework that allocates trainable parameters in a more targeted and effective manner. RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on fifteen commonsense and arithmetic benchmarks demonstrate that RoSA outperforms existing mainstream PEFT methods under comparable trainable parameters. The code is available to ease reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/RoSA.

Conclusion: VF and Iter-VF effectively enhance LLM reasoning with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without high costs of training, nor extensive test-time sampling, we introduce Verification-First (VF), a strategy that prompts models to verify a provided candidate answer, even a trivial or random one, before generating a solution. This approach triggers a "reverse reasoning" process that is cognitively easier and complementary to standard forward Chain-of-Thought (CoT), effectively invoking the model's critical thinking to reduce logical errors. We further generalize the VF strategy to Iter-VF, a sequential test-time scaling (TTS) method that iteratively cycles the verification-generation process using the model's previous answer. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks (from mathematical reasoning to coding and agentic tasks) and various LLMs (from open-source 1B to cutting-edge commercial ones) confirm that VF with random answer consistently outperforms standard CoT with minimal computational overhead, and Iter-VF outperforms existing TTS strategies.

TL;DR: MAIRA-X is an AI model for chest X-ray report generation that improves report quality and reduces radiologist workload by handling clinical findings and lines/tubes reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists face increased workload due to screening guidelines, complex cases, and shortages. AI can help maintain accuracy while easing repetitive tasks like interpreting lines and tubes.

Method: Developed using a large-scale dataset from Mayo Clinic (3.1M studies, 6M images), MAIRA-X was evaluated on holdout datasets and MIMIC-CXR. A novel L&T metrics framework and radiologist user study (600 studies) were conducted.

Result: MAIRA-X outperformed state-of-the-art models in lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T reporting. Critical error rates were low (4.6% AI vs. 3.0% original), and acceptable sentence rates were comparable (97.4% AI vs. 97.8% original).

Conclusion: MAIRA-X demonstrates effectiveness in assisting radiologists, particularly in high-volume settings, with minimal impact on report quality.

Abstract: AI-assisted report generation offers the opportunity to reduce radiologists' workload stemming from expanded screening guidelines, complex cases and workforce shortages, while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. In addition to describing pathological findings in chest X-ray reports, interpreting lines and tubes (L&T) is demanding and repetitive for radiologists, especially with high patient volumes. We introduce MAIRA-X, a clinically evaluated multimodal AI model for longitudinal chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, that encompasses both clinical findings and L&T reporting. Developed using a large-scale, multi-site, longitudinal dataset of 3.1 million studies (comprising 6 million images from 806k patients) from Mayo Clinic, MAIRA-X was evaluated on three holdout datasets and the public MIMIC-CXR dataset, where it significantly improved AI-generated reports over the state of the art on lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T-related elements. A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects. The user study found comparable rates of critical errors (3.0% for original vs. 4.6% for AI-generated reports) and a similar rate of acceptable sentences (97.8% for original vs. 97.4% for AI-generated reports), marking a significant improvement over prior user studies with larger gaps and higher error rates. Our results suggest that MAIRA-X can effectively assist radiologists, particularly in high-volume clinical settings.

TL;DR: R2Q is a novel 2-bit quantization framework that splits quantization into two 1-bit steps to mitigate accuracy loss, outperforming existing methods across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of severe accuracy degradation in 2-bit quantization of LLMs.

Method: Residual Refinement Quantization (R2Q) decomposes quantization into sequential 1-bit steps with adaptive lattice and residual learning.

Result: R2Q consistently surpasses existing 2-bit methods in benchmarks, improving accuracy, stability, and convergence.

Conclusion: R2Q's modular and effective design advances extreme compression for LLMs without compromising performance.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought substantial computational and memory demands, spurring the adoption of low-bit quantization. While 8-bit and 4-bit formats have become prevalent, extending quantization to 2 bits remains challenging due to severe accuracy degradation. To address this, we propose Residual Refinement Quantization (R2Q)-a novel 2-bit quantization framework that decomposes the process into two sequential 1-bit sub-quantizations, forming an adaptive quantization lattice. Extensive evaluations on Llama, OPT, and Qwen across diverse benchmarks-covering question answering, commonsense reasoning, and language modeling-demonstrate that R2Q consistently outperforms existing 2-bit quantization methods in both fine-grained and coarse-grained settings. By refining quantization through a residual learning mechanism, R2Q enhances performance, improves training stability, and accelerates convergence under extreme compression. Furthermore, its modular design enables seamless integration with existing quantization-aware training (QAT) frameworks.

*Sabrina Sadiekh,Elena Ericheva,Chirag Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS) to assess model alignment by evaluating internal representations' consistency under polarity inversion, proposing metrics like Polar-Consistency and Contradiction Index.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if unsupervised probes like CCS can reliably assess model alignment and quantify semantic robustness.

Method: Developed PA-CCS, curated datasets with harmful-safe pairs, and applied it to 16 models alongside structural checks.

Result: PA-CCS reveals architectural and layer-specific differences in harmful knowledge encoding; negation token replacement affects well-aligned models.

Conclusion: Unsupervised probing shows promise for alignment evaluation, highlighting the need for structural robustness checks.

Abstract: Advances in unsupervised probes such as Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), which reveal latent beliefs without relying on token outputs, raise the question of whether these methods can reliably assess model alignment. We investigate this by examining the sensitivity of CCS to harmful vs. safe statements and by introducing Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS), a method for evaluating whether a model's internal representations remain consistent under polarity inversion. We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge. To validate PA-CCS, we curate two main datasets and one control dataset containing matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed using different methodologies (concurrent and antagonistic statements). We apply PA-CCS to 16 language models. Our results show that PA-CCS identifies both architectural and layer-specific differences in the encoding of latent harmful knowledge. Notably, replacing the negation token with a meaningless marker degrades PA-CCS scores for models with well-aligned internal representations, while models lacking robust internal calibration do not exhibit this degradation. Our findings highlight the potential of unsupervised probing for alignment evaluation and emphasize the need to incorporate structural robustness checks into interpretability benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An end-to-end Brain-to-Text (BIT) framework improves speech BCI performance by jointly optimizing neural activity decoding into text using a pretrained encoder and audio LLMs, achieving a significant reduction in word error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cascaded frameworks for speech BCIs decode phonemes separately from sentence assembly, preventing joint optimization. The BIT framework addresses this limitation.

Method: BIT uses a cross-task, cross-species pretrained neural encoder and integrates audio LLMs with contrastive learning for end-to-end decoding.

Result: BIT reduces WER from 24.69% to 10.22%, achieves SOTA on benchmarks, and enables cross-task generalization between attempted and imagined speech.

Conclusion: BIT advances neural dataset integration and supports seamless, differentiable optimization for improved speech BCI performance.

Abstract: Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) aim to restore communication for people with paralysis by translating neural activity into text. Most systems use cascaded frameworks that decode phonemes before assembling sentences with an n-gram language model (LM), preventing joint optimization of all stages simultaneously. Here, we introduce an end-to-end Brain-to-Text (BIT) framework that translates neural activity into coherent sentences using a single differentiable neural network. Central to our approach is a cross-task, cross-species pretrained neural encoder, whose representations transfer to both attempted and imagined speech. In a cascaded setting with an n-gram LM, the pretrained encoder establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Brain-to-Text '24 and '25 benchmarks. Integrated end-to-end with audio large language models (LLMs) and trained with contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment, BIT reduces the word error rate (WER) of the prior end-to-end method from 24.69% to 10.22%. Notably, we find that small-scale audio LLMs markedly improve end-to-end decoding. Beyond record-setting performance, BIT aligns attempted and imagined speech embeddings to enable cross-task generalization. Altogether, our approach advances the integration of large, diverse neural datasets, paving the way for an end-to-end decoding framework that supports seamless, differentiable optimization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a geometric method integrating text and co-author network data to improve interpretable topic modeling, especially for rare topics and temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of contemporary models in identifying rare topics and capturing smooth temporal evolution in scientific corpora.

Method: Uses Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct a hierarchical topic dendrogram, integrating multimodal text and co-author network data.

Result: Effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time.

Conclusion: Interpretable bag-of-words models paired with geometric alignment are effective for multiscale learning in topic modeling.

Abstract: Interpretable topic modeling is essential for tracking how research interests evolve within co-author communities. In scientific corpora, where novelty is prized, identifying underrepresented niche topics is particularly important. However, contemporary models built from dense transformer embeddings tend to miss rare topics and therefore also fail to capture smooth temporal alignment. We propose a geometric method that integrates multimodal text and co-author network data, using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct a hierarchical topic dendrogram. This approach captures both local and global structure, supporting multiscale learning across semantic and temporal dimensions. Our method effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time. Experiments highlight the strength of interpretable bag-of-words models when paired with principled geometric alignment.

Motivation: To assess LLM-based QA systems in education by evaluating individual pipeline components for better transparency and effectiveness.

Method: Introduces a modular function-calling pipeline, evaluating function calling strategies, retrieval methods, and generative LLMs in isolation.

Result: Reveals specific failure modes and performance patterns, highlighting the benefits of modular function calling for educational QA systems.

Conclusion: Modular function calling enhances transparency and pedagogical alignment in educational QA systems.

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Question-Answering (QA) systems in education, it is critical to evaluate their performance across individual pipeline components. In this work, we introduce {\model}, a modular function-calling LLM pipeline, and present a comprehensive evaluation along three key axes: function calling strategies, retrieval methods, and generative language models. Our framework enables fine-grained analysis by isolating and assessing each component. We benchmark function-calling performance across LLMs, compare our novel structure-aware retrieval method to vector-based and LLM-scoring baselines, and evaluate various LLMs for response synthesis. This modular approach reveals specific failure modes and performance patterns, supporting the development of interpretable and effective educational QA systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study tracks reasoning tokens in language models during fine-tuning, likening them to human working memory. Models progress through stages akin to the Four Stages of Competence, with reasoning token length peaking mid-training. Insights suggest reasoning tokens scaffold learning but become unnecessary post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning tokens evolve during fine-tuning and align this progression with cognitive science's Four Stages of Competence, providing insights into model learning dynamics.

Method: Analyzed reasoning tokens (intermediate problem-solving steps) during task-specific fine-tuning, aligning their dynamics with cognitive stages. Proposed metrics to track progression.

Result: Reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at conscious competence, then declines. Post-training, models retain performance without reasoning tokens, indicating scaffolding.

Conclusion: Reasoning token dynamics offer actionable insights for diagnosing training stages, identifying convergence, and optimizing reasoning model training.

Abstract: We analyze reasoning in language models during task-specific fine-tuning and draws parallel between reasoning tokens--intermediate steps generated while solving problem and the human working memory. Drawing from cognitive science, we align training dynamics with the Four Stages of Competence: models initially produce incorrect outputs without reasoning, then begin reasoning (but still fail), eventually reason effectively, and finally solve tasks without explicit reasoning. We find that reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at the stage of conscious competence, then declines as the model internalizes the task. Notably, after training, models retain performance even when reasoning is removed--suggesting it scaffolded learning but is no longer needed. This progression offers actionable insights: reasoning token dynamics can serve as a signal for diagnosing training stage, identifying convergence, and guiding early stopping. We propose metrics to track this trajectory and argue that reasoning behavior is valuable for understanding and optimizing reasoning model training.

TL;DR: NEULIF introduces a lightweight AI-generated text detection method using stylometric and readability features with compact CNN or RF classifiers, achieving high accuracy without computational heaviness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and limited generalization of existing AI-generated text detection methods, NEULIF aims for lightweight, high-accuracy detection.

Method: Decomposes text into stylometric/readability features, classified by compact CNN or RF.

Result: Achieves 97% accuracy (CNN) and 95% (RF) on Kaggle corpus, with small model sizes (25 MB CNN, 10.6 MB RF).

Conclusion: NEULIF demonstrates that simplicity can rival complex methods in AI-text detection, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: A growing number of AI-generated texts raise serious concerns. Most existing approaches to AI-generated text detection rely on fine-tuning large transformer models or building ensembles, which are computationally expensive and often provide limited generalization across domains. Existing lightweight alternatives achieved significantly lower accuracy on large datasets. We introduce NEULIF, a lightweight approach that achieves best performance in the lightweight detector class, that does not require extensive computational power and provides high detection accuracy. In our approach, a text is first decomposed into stylometric and readability features which are then used for classification by a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest (RF). Evaluated and tested on the Kaggle AI vs. Human corpus, our models achieve 97% accuracy (~ 0.95 F1) for CNN and 95% accuracy (~ 0.94 F1) for the Random Forest, demonstrating high precision and recall, with ROC-AUC scores of 99.5% and 95%, respectively. The CNN (~ 25 MB) and Random Forest (~ 10.6 MB) models are orders of magnitude smaller than transformer-based ensembles and can be run efficiently on standard CPU devices, without sacrificing accuracy.This study also highlights the potential of such models for broader applications across languages, domains, and streaming contexts, showing that simplicity, when guided by structural insights, can rival complexity in AI-generated content detection.

Result: Achieves BLEU-1 21.9 and ROUGE-1 F 17.2, improving semantic alignment by up to 5.37 points on ZuCo dataset.

Conclusion: DELTA enables reliable text generation from small EEG-text datasets and suggests scalability for multimodal EEG-language models.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-to-text remains challenging due to high-dimensional noise, subject variability, and error accumulation in autoregressive decoding. We introduce DELTA, which pairs a Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) EEG tokenizer with a masked language diffusion model (LLaDA). RVQ discretizes continuous EEG into multi-layer tokens to reduce noise and individual differences, while LLaDA reconstructs sentences via non-sequential denoising. On ZuCo, DELTA improves semantic alignment by up to 5.37 points over autoregressive baselines, achieving BLEU-1 21.9 and ROUGE-1 F 17.2 under word-level conditions. These results enable reliable text generation from small EEG-text datasets and point toward scalable multimodal EEG-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage LLMs for specialized domains while addressing privacy concerns and resource constraints by developing smaller, domain-focused models.

Method: Combine guided synthetic data generation, DAPT, DSFT, and DPO to train specialized models like DiagnosticSLM (3B parameters).

Result: DiagnosticSLM outperforms larger models (2B-9B) by up to 25% in accuracy on domain-specific benchmarks (MCQ, QA, sentence completion, summarization).

Conclusion: The pipeline enables efficient development of small, domain-specific LLMs with strong reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in supporting a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation. Our pipeline integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train effective small-scale models for specialized use cases. We demonstrate this approach through DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter domain-specific model tailored for fault diagnosis, root cause analysis, and repair recommendation in industrial settings. To evaluate model performance, we introduce four domain-specific benchmarks: multiple-choice questions (DiagnosticMCQ), question answering (DiagnosticQA), sentence completion (DiagnosticComp), and summarization (DiagnosticSum). DiagnosticSLM achieves up to 25% accuracy improvement over open-source models of comparable or larger size (2B-9B) on the MCQ task, while also outperforming or matching them in other tasks, demonstrating effective domain-specific reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Motivation: The paper aims to improve AI safety and cognitive security by detecting and measuring persuasion attacks, quantifying vulnerabilities in language models, and enhancing human resilience.

Method: BRIES employs specialized agents (Twister, Detector, Defender, Assessor) to generate, detect, defend against, and evaluate persuasion attacks. It uses SemEval 2023 Task 3 taxonomy and experiments with synthetic datasets.

Result: GPT-4 outperforms open-source models like Llama3 and Mistral in detecting complex tactics. Prompt engineering impacts detection efficacy, with temperature settings varying model performance. Attack types target specific cognitive dimensions.

Conclusion: BRIES advances AI safety by quantifying LLM vulnerabilities to persuasion and provides a framework for cognitive resilience through pre-exposure interventions.

Abstract: This paper introduces BRIES, a novel compound AI architecture designed to detect and measure the effectiveness of persuasion attacks across information environments. We present a system with specialized agents: a Twister that generates adversarial content employing targeted persuasion tactics, a Detector that identifies attack types with configurable parameters, a Defender that creates resilient content through content inoculation, and an Assessor that employs causal inference to evaluate inoculation effectiveness. Experimenting with the SemEval 2023 Task 3 taxonomy across the synthetic persuasion dataset, we demonstrate significant variations in detection performance across language agents. Our comparative analysis reveals significant performance disparities with GPT-4 achieving superior detection accuracy on complex persuasion techniques, while open-source models like Llama3 and Mistral demonstrated notable weaknesses in identifying subtle rhetorical, suggesting that different architectures encode and process persuasive language patterns in fundamentally different ways. We show that prompt engineering dramatically affects detection efficacy, with temperature settings and confidence scoring producing model-specific variations; Gemma and GPT-4 perform optimally at lower temperatures while Llama3 and Mistral show improved capabilities at higher temperatures. Our causal analysis provides novel insights into socio-emotional-cognitive signatures of persuasion attacks, revealing that different attack types target specific cognitive dimensions. This research advances generative AI safety and cognitive security by quantifying LLM-specific vulnerabilities to persuasion attacks and delivers a framework for enhancing human cognitive resilience through structured interventions before exposure to harmful content.

*Yanxi Li,Ruocheng Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Label Disguise Defense (LDD) hides true labels with aliases to protect against prompt injection attacks, restoring some accuracy across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counter class-directive injections in text classification by concealing true labels to prevent adversarial overrides.

Method: LDD replaces labels with semantically transformed or unrelated aliases, learned through few-shot demonstrations.

Result: LDD restores degraded accuracy under attack; semantically aligned aliases outperform unaligned ones.

Conclusion: Label semantics can effectively defend against prompt injection, acting as a protective layer.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, yet their reliance on natural language prompts exposes them to prompt injection attacks. In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection.

### [240] [Extracting Disaster Impacts and Impact Related Locations in Social Media Posts Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21753)
*Sameeah Noreen Hameed,Surangika Ranathunga,Raj Prasanna,Kristin Stock,Christopher B. Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using fine-tuned LLMs to identify disaster-impacted locations from social media posts, outperforming baselines with F1-scores of 0.69 for impacts and 0.74 for locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Authoritative disaster data often lacks timeliness and coverage, while social media posts provide real-time, location-specific impact details. However, distinguishing impacted locations from non-impacted ones is challenging.

Method: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fine-tuned to extract impacts and impacted locations from disaster-related social media posts, including informal expressions and abbreviations.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieved F1-scores of 0.69 (impacts) and 0.74 (impacted locations), significantly outperforming the pre-trained baseline.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs offer a scalable solution for improving situational awareness and resource allocation in disaster response.

Abstract: Large-scale disasters can often result in catastrophic consequences on people and infrastructure. Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as "geo-sensors" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., "The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece." contains impacted location "Mati" and non-impacted locations "Greece" and "Athens". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders.

Motivation: Addressing reproducible hallucinations in LLMs during arithmetic operations in financial contexts, aiming to move beyond black-box mitigation strategies.

Method: Uses Causal Tracing on GPT-2 XL (ConvFinQA benchmark) to identify specific layers involved in arithmetic reasoning (L12-L30 for computation, Layer 46 for aggregation). Validates through ablation and probes.

Result: Suppressing Layer 46 reduces hallucinations by 81.8%. A linear probe on Layer 46 achieves 98% accuracy in detecting hallucinations across unseen financial topics.

Conclusion: Identifies a universal mechanism for arithmetic deception in LLMs, enabling targeted intervention to improve reliability in financial applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes financial domains, yet they suffer from specific, reproducible hallucinations when performing arithmetic operations. Current mitigation strategies often treat the model as a black box. In this work, we propose a mechanistic approach to intrinsic hallucination detection. By applying Causal Tracing to the GPT-2 XL architecture on the ConvFinQA benchmark, we identify a dual-stage mechanism for arithmetic reasoning: a distributed computational scratchpad in middle layers (L12-L30) and a decisive aggregation circuit in late layers (specifically Layer 46). We verify this mechanism via an ablation study, demonstrating that suppressing Layer 46 reduces the model's confidence in hallucinatory outputs by 81.8%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a linear probe trained on this layer generalizes to unseen financial topics with 98% accuracy, suggesting a universal geometry of arithmetic deception.

Method: Proposes adaptive length prediction for prefill and jump-share speculative decoding for decoding phases.

Result: Achieves 46-162x speedup over baseline dLLM and 2.63-6.30x over Fast-dLLM while reducing accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: ODB-dLLM effectively addresses inefficiencies in dLLM inference, offering substantial speedups without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently gained significant attention for their exceptional performance and inherent potential for parallel decoding. Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks.

TL;DR: A new temporal consistency method improves verification accuracy in mathematical reasoning by iteratively refining judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance verification effectiveness in mathematical reasoning beyond one-round or multi-model debate approaches.

Method: Leverages consistency through iterative self-reflection actions for verification refinement.

Result: Empirical evaluations show performance gains on benchmarks like Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K. Distilled models (7B/8B) outperform larger models (70B/72B) and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The temporal consistency method significantly improves verification accuracy, enabling smaller models to surpass larger ones and GPT-4o.

Abstract: Verification is crucial for effective mathematical reasoning. We present a new temporal consistency method where verifiers iteratively refine their judgments based on the previous assessment. Unlike one-round verification or multi-model debate approaches, our method leverages consistency in a sequence of self-reflection actions to improve verification accuracy. Empirical evaluations across diverse mathematical process error identification benchmarks (Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K) show consistent performance improvements over baseline methods. When applied to the recent DeepSeek R1 distilled models, our method demonstrates strong performance, enabling 7B/8B distilled models to outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench. Notably, the distilled 14B model with our method achieves performance comparable to Deepseek-R1. Our codes are available at https://github.com/jcguo123/Temporal-Consistency

*Yuxiang Wei,Yanteng Zhang,Xi Xiao,Chengxuan Qian,Tianyang Wang,Vince D. Calhoun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: fMRI-LM bridges fMRI and language through neural tokenization, joint modeling with LLMs, and instruction tuning, achieving strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending multimodal LLMs to brain imaging links neural activity with semantic cognition and develops cross-modal brain representations.

Method: Three-stage framework: neural tokenizer maps fMRI to tokens, LLM jointly models tokens/text, and instruction tuning enhances semantic understanding.

Result: Achieves strong zero-shot/few-shot performance and efficient adaptation with LoRA.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable pathway for language-aligned, universal fMRI understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have enabled unified reasoning across images, audio, and video, but extending such capability to brain imaging remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.

### [245] [On the Role of Preference Variance in Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13022)
*Jiacheng Guo,Zihao Li,Jiahao Qiu,Yue Wu,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for LLM alignment, focusing on preference variance (PVar) to reduce costly human annotations. It shows higher PVar prompts yield better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on costly human preference data by investigating the role of preference variance (PVar) in DPO training efficiency.

Method: Theoretical analysis bounds DPO gradient norm by PVar. Experiments fine-tune LLMs with PVar-ranked prompts using reward models and evaluate on benchmarks.

Result: Higher PVar prompts outperform random or low PVar selections. Top 10% PVar prompts using human annotations achieve better performance than the full dataset.

Conclusion: PVar is crucial for identifying informative prompts, improving LLM alignment efficiency without exhaustive human annotations.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs). However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

*Tabia Tanzin Prama,Christopher M. Danforth,Peter Sheridan Dodds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLM-based translation for Sylheti, a low-resource dialect, introducing Sylheti-CAP to improve accuracy by incorporating linguistic rules and vocabulary into prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' strong translation abilities, their performance in dialectal and low-resource contexts like Sylheti is understudied.

Method: Evaluated five LLMs for Bangla-Sylheti translation and proposed Sylheti-CAP, a framework embedding linguistic rules, a dictionary, and authenticity checks into prompts.

Result: Sylheti-CAP consistently improved translation quality across models, reducing hallucinations and ambiguities, as confirmed by metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Sylheti-CAP is a scalable solution for dialectal and low-resource MT, demonstrating significant improvements in translation accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong translation abilities through prompting, even without task-specific training. However, their effectiveness in dialectal and low-resource contexts remains underexplored. This study presents the first systematic investigation of LLM-based machine translation (MT) for Sylheti, a dialect of Bangla that is itself low-resource. We evaluate five advanced LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1, LLaMA 4, Grok 3, and DeepSeek V3.2) across both translation directions (Bangla $\Leftrightarrow$ Sylheti), and find that these models struggle with dialect-specific vocabulary. To address this, we introduce Sylheti-CAP (Context-Aware Prompting), a three-step framework that embeds a linguistic rulebook, a dictionary (2{,}260 core vocabulary items and idioms), and an authenticity check directly into prompts. Extensive experiments show that Sylheti-CAP consistently improves translation quality across models and prompting strategies. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirm its effectiveness, while qualitative analysis reveals notable reductions in hallucinations, ambiguities, and awkward phrasing, establishing Sylheti-CAP as a scalable solution for dialectal and low-resource MT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLAWS, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to detect and localize errors in scientific papers, achieving 39.1% accuracy with GPT 5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of scientific output makes human error detection unreliable, prompting interest in LLMs for automated error identification.

Method: FLAWS benchmarks LLMs using 713 paper-error pairs with claim-invalidating errors, evaluated via an automated metric.

Result: GPT 5 performs best among five LLMs, achieving 39.1% accuracy in identifying errors.

Conclusion: FLAWS demonstrates LLMs' potential for error detection, though accuracy remains limited.

Abstract: The identification and localization of errors is a core task in peer review, yet the exponential growth of scientific output has made it increasingly difficult for human reviewers to reliably detect errors given the limited pool of experts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM.

TL;DR: CoRA is a new metric assessing LLM consistency in MC benchmarks, using synthetic questions and intermediate scores (BMCA, CI) to adjust accuracy based on response consistency. It effectively penalizes inconsistent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliability issue of LLM scores in MC benchmarks by measuring response consistency, as high MCQA scores may mask inconsistency.

Method: Introduce CoRA, leveraging synthetic questions with altered choices and intermediate metrics (BMCA, CI) to adjust MCQA scores for consistency.

Result: Evaluations show LLMs can be inconsistent despite high MCQA scores, and CoRA successfully reduces scores for inconsistent models.

Conclusion: CoRA improves LLM evaluation reliability by incorporating consistency, balancing accuracy with response stability.

Abstract: In this work we present the Consistency-Rebalanced Accuracy (CoRA) metric, improving the reliability of Large Language Model (LLM) scores computed on multiple choice (MC) benchmarks. Our metric explores the response consistency of the LLMs, taking advantage of synthetically-generated questions with altered answer choices. With two intermediate scores, i.e. Bare-Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (BMCA) and Consistency Index (CI), CoRA is computed by adjusting the multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) scores to better reflect the level of consistency of the LLM. We present evaluations in different benchmarks using diverse LLMs, and not only demonstrate that LLMs can present low response consistency even when they present high MCQA scores, but also that CoRA can successfully scale down the scores of inconsistent models.

*Sofie Labat,Thomas Demeester,Véronique Hoste*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmoWOZ-CS, a bilingual dialogue corpus created via a WOZ experiment for emotion-aware customer service, addressing gaps in existing resources. It evaluates affective strategies, annotation performance, and real-time emotion inference challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion recognition resources lack domain relevance, rich annotations, and predictive capabilities for customer service. The study aims to bridge these gaps by creating an in-domain dataset and analyzing affective interactions.

Method: A controlled WOZ experiment elicited dialogues with targeted affective trajectories across commercial domains. The resulting corpus, EmoWOZ-CS, includes 2,148 bilingual dialogues annotated for emotions, valence, arousal, and dominance.

Result: Neutral emotions dominate; gratitude and desire are common non-neutral emotions. Annotation agreement varies, with notable divergences between self-reports and third-party labels. Affective strategies influence emotional outcomes, with some fostering reciprocity and others triggering negative emotions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates WOZ-based corpus effectiveness for emotion research, highlights annotation challenges, and underscores the complexity of proactive emotion inference in customer service.

Abstract: Emotion-aware customer service needs in-domain conversational data, rich annotations, and predictive capabilities, but existing resources for emotion recognition are often out-of-domain, narrowly labeled, and focused on post-hoc detection. To address this, we conducted a controlled Wizard of Oz (WOZ) experiment to elicit interactions with targeted affective trajectories. The resulting corpus, EmoWOZ-CS, contains 2,148 bilingual (Dutch-English) written dialogues from 179 participants across commercial aviation, e-commerce, online travel agencies, and telecommunication scenarios. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Evaluate WOZ-based operator-steered valence trajectories as a design for emotion research; (2) Quantify human annotation performance and variation, including divergences between self-reports and third-party judgments; (3) Benchmark detection and forward-looking emotion inference in real-time support. Findings show neutral dominates participant messages; desire and gratitude are the most frequent non-neutral emotions. Agreement is moderate for multilabel emotions and valence, lower for arousal and dominance; self-reports diverge notably from third-party labels, aligning most for neutral, gratitude, and anger. Objective strategies often elicit neutrality or gratitude, while suboptimal strategies increase anger, annoyance, disappointment, desire, and confusion. Some affective strategies (cheerfulness, gratitude) foster positive reciprocity, whereas others (apology, empathy) can also leave desire, anger, or annoyance. Temporal analysis confirms successful conversation-level steering toward prescribed trajectories, most distinctly for negative targets; positive and neutral targets yield similar final valence distributions. Benchmarks highlight the difficulty of forward-looking emotion inference from prior turns, underscoring the complexity of proactive emotion-aware support.

*Karin de Langis,William Walker,Khanh Chi Le,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An annotation approach capturing reading processes via mouse tracking is proposed, revealing insights into annotator behaviors and their impact on reliability and agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand annotators' decision-making processes in preference annotation tasks by analyzing their reading behaviors, such as focus and re-reading patterns.

Method: Developed a framework using mouse tracking to record annotators' reading behaviors (e.g., focus, re-reading) during preference annotation tasks, creating the PreferRead dataset.

Result: Annotators often re-read chosen responses, rarely revisit prompts, and reading behaviors correlate with agreement (re-reading boosts it; long paths/times reduce it).

Conclusion: Reading behaviors offer valuable cognitive insights into annotator reliability and decision-making in subjective NLP tasks.

Abstract: We propose an annotation approach that captures not only labels but also the reading process underlying annotators' decisions, e.g., what parts of the text they focus on, re-read or skim. Using this framework, we conduct a case study on the preference annotation task, creating a dataset PreferRead that contains fine-grained annotator reading behaviors obtained from mouse tracking. PreferRead enables detailed analysis of how annotators navigate between a prompt and two candidate responses before selecting their preference. We find that annotators re-read a response in roughly half of all trials, most often revisiting the option they ultimately choose, and rarely revisit the prompt. Reading behaviors are also significantly related to annotation outcomes: re-reading is associated with higher inter-annotator agreement, whereas long reading paths and times are associated with lower agreement. These results demonstrate that reading processes provide a complementary cognitive dimension for understanding annotator reliability, decision-making and disagreement in complex, subjective NLP tasks. Our code and data are publicly available.

*Yuxin Li,Lorraine Xu,Meng Fan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new study on authorship attribution for Chinese lyrics, addressing gaps in datasets and models, and evaluates genre-specific performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of clean, public datasets for Chinese lyrics and the need for domain-specific models motivated this research.

Method: The authors created a balanced dataset of Chinese lyrics across genres and fine-tuned a domain-specific model, comparing it with zero-shot DeepSeek LLM inference.

Result: Results confirmed genre-dependent performance, with structured genres outperforming abstract ones. Fine-tuning showed robustness but limited gains in synthetic data.

Conclusion: The study sets a benchmark for Chinese lyric attribution, emphasizes genre-sensitive evaluation, and suggests future improvements like diverse test sets and adaptive pretraining.

Abstract: We propose a novel study on authorship attribution for Chinese lyrics, a domain where clean, public datasets are sorely lacking. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we create a new, balanced dataset of Chinese lyrics spanning multiple genres, and (2) we develop and fine-tune a domain-specific model, comparing its performance against zero-shot inference using the DeepSeek LLM.
  We test two central hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that a fine-tuned model will outperform a zero-shot LLM baseline. Second, we hypothesize that performance is genre-dependent. Our experiments strongly confirm Hypothesis 2: structured genres (e.g. Folklore & Tradition) yield significantly higher attribution accuracy than more abstract genres (e.g. Love & Romance). Hypothesis 1 receives only partial support: fine-tuning improves robustness and generalization in Test1 (real-world data and difficult genres), but offers limited or ambiguous gains in Test2, a smaller, synthetically-augmented set. We show that the design limitations of Test2 (e.g., label imbalance, shallow lexical differences, and narrow genre sampling) can obscure the true effectiveness of fine-tuning.
  Our work establishes the first benchmark for cross-genre Chinese lyric attribution, highlights the importance of genre-sensitive evaluation, and provides a public dataset and analytical framework for future research. We conclude with recommendations: enlarge and diversify test sets, reduce reliance on token-level data augmentation, balance author representation across genres, and investigate domain-adaptive pretraining as a pathway for improved attribution performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how attention mechanisms in Transformer LMs contribute to word sense disambiguation, identifying key heads and their developmental patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how self-attention operations in Transformer LMs map to interpretable functions, specifically focusing on word sense disambiguation.

Method: A developmental approach using Pythia LM checkpoints to identify heads involved in disambiguation, followed by robustness and causal analyses.

Result: Smaller models (14M) show limited robustness, while larger models (410M) exhibit more generalizable disambiguation behavior.

Conclusion: Disambiguation involves multiple mechanisms, with larger models harboring more robust heads, and highlights the value of developmental probing.

Abstract: Despite an in-principle understanding of self-attention matrix operations in Transformer language models (LMs), it remains unclear precisely how these operations map onto interpretable computations or functions--and how or when individual attention heads develop specialized attention patterns. Here, we present a pipeline to systematically probe attention mechanisms, and we illustrate its value by leveraging lexical ambiguity--where a single word has multiple meanings--to isolate attention mechanisms that contribute to word sense disambiguation. We take a "developmental" approach: first, using publicly available Pythia LM checkpoints, we identify inflection points in disambiguation performance for each LM in the suite; in 14M and 410M, we identify heads whose attention to disambiguating words covaries with overall disambiguation performance across development. We then stress-test the robustness of these heads to stimulus perturbations: in 14M, we find limited robustness, but in 410M, we identify multiple heads with surprisingly generalizable behavior. Then, in a causal analysis, we find that ablating the target heads demonstrably impairs disambiguation performance, particularly in 14M. We additionally reproduce developmental analyses of 14M across all of its random seeds. Together, these results suggest: that disambiguation benefits from a constellation of mechanisms, some of which (especially in 14M) are highly sensitive to the position and part-of-speech of the disambiguating cue; and that larger models (410M) may contain heads with more robust disambiguation behavior. They also join a growing body of work that highlights the value of adopting a developmental perspective when probing LM mechanisms.

TL;DR: AfriStereo is the first open-source dataset and framework addressing AI bias in African contexts, highlighting significant biases in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI bias benchmarks are Western-centric, underrepresenting African perspectives and perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Method: Collected 1,163 stereotypes in Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, expanded to 5,000 pairs via few-shot prompting and human validation.

Result: Nine of eleven models showed significant bias (BPR 0.63-0.78), with stereotypes preferred over antistereotypes.

Conclusion: AfriStereo enables culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, promoting equitable AI.

Abstract: Existing AI bias evaluation benchmarks largely reflect Western perspectives, leaving African contexts underrepresented and enabling harmful stereotypes in applications across various domains. To address this gap, we introduce AfriStereo, the first open-source African stereotype dataset and evaluation framework grounded in local socio-cultural contexts. Through community engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, we collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations. Looking ahead, AfriStereo opens pathways for future research on culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, offering key methodologies for the AI community on building more equitable, context-aware, and globally inclusive NLP technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fragmented academic data sources and tasks, enabling better machine learning support for researchers and accelerating knowledge discovery.

Method: ResearchArcade uses a graph-based unified data interface, organizing multi-modal data (text, figures, tables) from sources like ArXiv and OpenReview. It preserves temporal evolution and supports diverse models.

Result: Experiments across six academic tasks show improved performance by integrating cross-source, multi-modal, and graph-structured data.

Conclusion: ResearchArcade effectively enhances research progress by unifying data and tasks, demonstrating its potential for broader academic applications.

Abstract: Academic research generates diverse data sources, and as researchers increasingly use machine learning to assist research tasks, a crucial question arises: Can we build a unified data interface to support the development of machine learning models for various academic tasks? Models trained on such a unified interface can better support human researchers throughout the research process, eventually accelerating knowledge discovery. In this work, we introduce ResearchArcade, a graph-based interface that connects multiple academic data sources, unifies task definitions, and supports a wide range of base models to address key academic challenges. ResearchArcade utilizes a coherent multi-table format with graph structures to organize data from different sources, including academic corpora from ArXiv and peer reviews from OpenReview, while capturing information with multiple modalities, such as text, figures, and tables. ResearchArcade also preserves temporal evolution at both the manuscript and community levels, supporting the study of paper revisions as well as broader research trends over time. Additionally, ResearchArcade unifies diverse academic task definitions and supports various models with distinct input requirements. Our experiments across six academic tasks demonstrate that combining cross-source and multi-modal information enables a broader range of tasks, while incorporating graph structures consistently improves performance over baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness of ResearchArcade and its potential to advance research progress.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents two methods, HiTGNN and ReVeAL, for predicting chronic disease risks from EHR clinical notes, addressing NLP challenges and improving accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain valuable temporal and contextual data missing in structured EHRs, but their use for predictive modeling faces NLP challenges like long text and privacy concerns.

Method: HiTGNN integrates temporal event structures and medical knowledge hierarchically, while ReVeAL distills reasoning from large language models into smaller verifiers for efficient T2D screening.

Result: HiTGNN achieves high predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk, and ReVeAL enhances sensitivity and retains explanatory reasoning, with both methods showing improved fairness across subgroups.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively leverage temporal and contextual data from EHRs for chronic disease prediction, balancing accuracy, privacy, and fairness.

Abstract: Clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) capture rich temporal information on events, clinician reasoning, and lifestyle factors often missing from structured data. Leveraging them for predictive modeling can be impactful for timely identification of chronic diseases. However, they present core natural language processing (NLP) challenges: long text, irregular event distribution, complex temporal dependencies, privacy constraints, and resource limitations. We present two complementary methods for temporally and contextually grounded risk prediction from longitudinal notes. First, we introduce HiTGNN, a hierarchical temporal graph neural network that integrates intra-note temporal event structures, inter-visit dynamics, and medical knowledge to model patient trajectories with fine-grained temporal granularity. Second, we propose ReVeAL, a lightweight, test-time framework that distills the reasoning of large language models into smaller verifier models. Applied to opportunistic screening for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using temporally realistic cohorts curated from private and public hospital corpora, HiTGNN achieves the highest predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk, while preserving privacy and limiting reliance on large proprietary models. ReVeAL enhances sensitivity to true T2D cases and retains explanatory reasoning. Our ablations confirm the value of temporal structure and knowledge augmentation, and fairness analysis shows HiTGNN performs more equitably across subgroups.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model using LLMs to predict belief change in online discourse, identifying key features like epistemic emotion and willingness to share.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in traditional psychological models by adapting them for social media's text-based, large-scale discourse.

Method: Combines LLM-generated feature ratings with a random forest classification model to predict belief change.

Result: Epistemic emotion and willingness to share were the top predictors of belief change.

Conclusion: The model offers insights for persuasive messaging and broader applications in online influence and misinformation.

Abstract: Traditional psychological models of belief revision focus on face-to-face interactions, but with the rise of social media, more effective models are needed to capture belief revision at scale, in this rich text-based online discourse. Here, we use a hybrid approach, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to develop a model that predicts successful persuasion using features derived from psychological experiments.
  Our approach leverages LLM generated ratings of features previously examined in the literature to build a random forest classification model that predicts whether a message will result in belief change. Of the eight features tested, \textit{epistemic emotion} and \textit{willingness to share} were the top-ranking predictors of belief change in the model. Our findings provide insights into the characteristics of persuasive messages and demonstrate how LLMs can enhance models of successful persuasion based on psychological theory. Given these insights, this work has broader applications in fields such as online influence detection and misinformation mitigation, as well as measuring the effectiveness of online narratives.

*Shuhei Yamashita,Daiki Shirafuji,Tatsuhiko Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a similarity standardization method using pseudo data to address the modality gap in cross-modality retrieval, improving performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap in vision-language models (VLMs) causes inconsistent similarity scores across text and image modalities, hindering accurate retrieval. Existing methods rely on manual labeling, which is resource-intensive.

Method: The authors compute modality-specific statistics (mean and variance) from pseudo pairs (retrieved candidates with highest cosine similarity) and standardize similarity scores to compare across modalities.

Result: The method achieves average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA, outperforming baselines like E5-V.

Conclusion: The similarity standardization approach effectively bridges the modality gap without manual labeling, enhancing retrieval performance in multi-modal QA tasks.

Abstract: Advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled effective cross-modality retrieval. However, when both text and images exist in the database, similarity scores would differ in scale by modality. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, hinders accurate retrieval. Most existing studies address this issue with manually labeled data, e.g., by fine-tuning VLMs on them. In this work, we propose a similarity standardization approach with pseudo data construction. We first compute the mean and variance of the similarity scores between each query and its paired data in text or image modality. Using these modality-specific statistics, we standardize all similarity scores to compare on a common scale across modalities. These statistics are calculated from pseudo pairs, which are constructed by retrieving the text and image candidates with the highest cosine similarity to each query. We evaluate our method across seven VLMs using two multi-modal QA benchmarks (MMQA and WebQA), where each question requires retrieving either text or image data. Our experimental results show that our method significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA when the query and the target data belong to different modalities. Compared to E5-V, which addresses the modality gap through image captioning, we confirm that our method more effectively bridges the modality gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C$^2$DLM improves reasoning in language models by incorporating causal concept guidance, achieving better performance and faster training compared to AR and DLM paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the insufficient reasoning capabilities of AR and DLM paradigms by leveraging causal knowledge inherent in natural language.

Method: Introduce C$^2$DLM, which uses a concept-level causal graph to guide attention and learn causal relationships explicitly.

Result: Achieves a 12% improvement with 3.2x training speedup in COT-OrderPerturb and a 1.31% average gain across six tasks.

Conclusion: C$^2$DLM effectively enhances reasoning by focusing on causal relationships, outperforming traditional paradigms.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models and Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) constitute the two principal paradigms of large language models. However, both paradigms suffer from insufficient reasoning capabilities. Human reasoning inherently relies on causal knowledge and thought, which are reflected in natural language. But in the AR paradigm, language is modeled as next token prediction (a strictly left-to-right, token-by-token order), whereas natural language itself exhibits more flexible causal structures. In the DLM paradigm, the attention mechanism is fully connected, which entirely disregards causal order. To fill this gap, we propose a \underline{\textbf{C}}ausal \underline{\textbf{C}}oncept-Guided \underline{\textbf{D}}iffusion \underline{\textbf{L}}anguage \underline{\textbf{M}}odel (C$^2$DLM). Starting from DLM's fully connected attention, C$^2$DLM first obtains a concept-level causal graph from the teacher model, and then explicitly guides attention to learn causal relationships between concepts. By focusing on causal relationships and avoiding interference from difficult subgoals involving causal inversion, C$^2$DLM improves 12\% with about 3.2 times training speedup in the COT-OrderPerturb task, and achieves an average gain of 1.31\% across six downstream reasoning tasks.

*Sepyan Purnama Kristanto,Lutfi Hakim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid ensemble method combining three detection paradigms improves accuracy and reduces false positives in distinguishing human-written from LLM-generated text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs threatens academic integrity, and current detectors lack generalization and reliability, especially for academic texts.

Method: A hybrid ensemble integrates RoBERTa-based semantic analysis, GPT-2-based probabilistic detection, and statistical linguistic features, with optimized weighted voting.

Result: Achieves 94.2% accuracy, AUC of 0.978, and a 35% reduction in false positives on a large-scale corpus.

Conclusion: The proposed detector is reliable and ethically viable for high-stakes applications like education.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has blurred the line between human and machine authorship, creating practical risks for academic integrity and information reliability. Existing text detectors typically rely on a single methodological paradigm and suffer from poor generalization and high false positive rates (FPR), especially on high-stakes academic text. We propose a theoretically grounded hybrid ensemble that systematically fuses three complementary detection paradigms: (i) a RoBERTa-based transformer classifier for deep semantic feature extraction, (ii) a GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, and (iii) a statistical linguistic feature analyzer capturing stylometric patterns. The core novelty lies in an optimized weighted voting framework, where ensemble weights are learned on the probability simplex to maximize F1-score rather than set heuristically. We provide a bias-variance analysis and empirically demonstrate low inter-model correlation (rho ~ 0.35-0.42), a key condition for variance reduction. Evaluated on a large-scale, multigenerator corpus of 30,000 documents, our system achieves 94.2% accuracy and an AUC of 0.978, with a 35% relative reduction in false positives on academic text. This yields a more reliable and ethically responsible detector for real-world deployment in education and other high-stakes domains.

*Bernd J. Kröger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how DYNARTmo models articulatory tradeoffs between primary and secondary articulators, focusing on lips-jaw and tongue-jaw coordination, using simplified biomechanics to reproduce realistic movement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand articulatory tradeoffs and synergy in speech production, assessing whether simplified models like DYNARTmo can capture these dynamics despite not using full task-dynamic biomechanics.

Method: DYNARTmo uses first-order task-space gesture specifications, akin to articulatory phonology, and simplifies articulatory effort distribution. Simulations analyze CV syllables with varying jaw displacement based on place of articulation and vowel context.

Result: The model successfully replicates empirical patterns of articulatory synergy, including jaw-supported closures, lower-lip elevation, tongue-jaw co-movement, and labial saturation effects.

Conclusion: Even with simplified assumptions, DYNARTmo generates realistic movement patterns, demonstrating its ability to model articulatory tradeoffs and synergies across consonant-vowel combinations.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the dynamic articulatory model DYNARTmo accounts for articulatory tradeoffs between primary and secondary articulators, with a focus on lips-jaw and tongue-jaw coordination. While DYNARTmo does not implement full task-dynamic second-order biomechanics, it adopts first-order task-space gesture specifications comparable to those used in articulatory phonology and integrates a simplified mechanism for distributing articulatory effort across multiple articulators. We first outline the conceptual relationship between task dynamics and DYNARTmo, emphasizing the distinction between high-level task-space trajectories and their low-level articulatory execution. We then present simulation results for a set of CV syllables that illustrate how jaw displacement varies as a function of both place of articulation (labial, apical, dorsal) and vowel context (/a/, /i/, /u/). The model reproduces empirically attested patterns of articulatory synergy, including jaw-supported apical closures, lower-lip elevation in bilabial stops, tongue-jaw co-movement, and saturation effects in labial constrictions. These results demonstrate that even with computationally simplified assumptions, DYNARTmo can generate realistic spatio-temporal movement patterns that capture key aspects of articulatory tradeoff and synergy across a range of consonant-vowel combinations.

*Young-Jun Lee,Seungone Kim,Byung-Kwan Lee,Minkyeong Moon,Yechan Hwang,Jong Myoung Kim,Graham Neubig,Sean Welleck,Ho-Jin Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether language models (LMs) can self-refine their responses, introducing RefineBench to evaluate guided and self-refinement modes. Results show LMs struggle with self-refinement but perform well with feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the gap in understanding LMs' refinement abilities for open-ended queries and the advent of self-reflective reasoning models.

Method: The authors introduce RefineBench, a benchmark with 1,000 problems across 11 domains, evaluating LMs in guided (with feedback) and self-refinement (without guidance) modes.

Result: Frontier LMs like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 show limited self-refinement success (~30%), while guided refinement allows near-perfect results within five turns.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for breakthroughs in LM self-refinement and position RefineBench as a valuable tool for tracking progress.

Abstract: Can language models (LMs) self-refine their own responses? This question is increasingly relevant as a wide range of real-world user interactions involve refinement requests. However, prior studies have largely tested LMs' refinement abilities on verifiable tasks such as competition math or symbolic reasoning with simplified scaffolds, whereas users often pose open-ended queries and provide varying degrees of feedback on what they desire. The recent advent of reasoning models that exhibit self-reflection patterns in their chains-of-thought further motivates this question. To analyze this, we introduce RefineBench, a benchmark of 1,000 challenging problems across 11 domains paired with a checklist-based evaluation framework. We evaluate two refinement modes: (1) guided refinement, where an LM is provided natural language feedback, and (2) self-refinement, where LMs attempt to improve without guidance. In the self-refinement setting, even frontier LMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 achieve modest baseline scores of 31.3% and 29.1%, respectively, and most models fail to consistently improve across iterations (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro gains only +1.8%, while DeepSeek-R1 declines by -0.1%). By contrast, in guided refinement, both proprietary LMs and large open-weight LMs (>70B) can leverage targeted feedback to refine responses to near-perfect levels within five turns. These findings suggest that frontier LMs require breakthroughs to self-refine their incorrect responses, and that RefineBench provides a valuable testbed for tracking progress.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT) reduces token use and latency in large language models by structuring essential information separately from reasoning, maintaining accuracy while cutting tokens by 2-3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address excessive token use and high inference latency caused by detailed chain-of-thought traces in large language models.

Method: Introduces F-CoT, separating information extraction from reasoning by organizing essential query info into concise context, guiding reasoning exclusively over it.

Result: Reduces generated tokens by 2-3x on arithmetic word problems while maintaining comparable accuracy to standard zero-shot CoT.

Conclusion: Structured input via F-CoT is a simple, effective method for efficient LLM reasoning without training interventions.

Abstract: Recent large language models achieve strong reasoning performance by generating detailed chain-of-thought traces, but this often leads to excessive token use and high inference latency. Existing efficiency approaches typically focus on model-centric interventions, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, to reduce verbosity. In contrast, we propose a training-free, input-centric approach. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT. These results highlight structured input as a simple yet effective lever for more efficient LLM reasoning.

*Guifeng Wang,Yuanfeng Song,Meng Yang,Tao Zhu,Xiaoming Yin,Xing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RuCo-C introduces a generative judge model for fine-grained, automated evaluation of Text-to-SQL tasks, addressing limitations in current evaluation methods by using query-specific rubrics and densified rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL evaluations rely on costly gold SQL annotations and coarse-grained reinforcement learning rewards, which overlook structural and semantic errors.

Method: RuCo-C generates query-specific evaluation rubrics and integrates densified reward feedback via a 'progressive exploration' strategy during RL training.

Result: RuCo-C outperforms existing methods, achieving significant performance gains in Text-to-SQL evaluation.

Conclusion: RuCo-C offers a scalable and interpretable solution for improving Text-to-SQL model evaluation and training.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, a pivotal natural language processing (NLP) task that converts textual queries into executable SQL, has seen substantial progress in recent years. However, existing evaluation and reward mechanisms used to train and assess the text-to-SQL models remain a critical bottleneck. Current approaches heavily rely on manually annotated gold SQL queries, which are costly to produce and impractical for large-scale evaluation. More importantly, most reinforcement learning (RL) methods in text-to-SQL leverage only the final binary execution outcome as the reward signal, a coarse-grained supervision that overlooks detailed structural and semantic errors from the perspective of rubrics. To address these challenges, we propose RuCo-C, a novel generative judge model for fine-grained, query-specific automatic evaluation using interpretable critiques without human intervention. Our framework first automatically generates query-specific evaluation rubrics for human-free annotation, linking them to interpretable critiques. Subsequently, it integrates densified reward feedback through a "progressive exploration" strategy during the RL training process, which dynamically adjusts the rewards to enhance the model's performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RuCo-C outperforms existing methods in text-to-SQL evaluation, yielding significant performance gains.

*Anjaneya Praharaj,Jaykumar Kasundra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve interpretable confidence scores in generative LLMs for multi-label safety classification, addressing the lack of direct probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative LLMs like LLaMA Guard lack direct class-level probabilities, complicating confidence assessment, dynamic thresholding, and error analysis in content safety moderation.

Method: Three novel token-level probability estimation approaches are introduced to enhance interpretability and accuracy.

Result: Token logits significantly improve interpretability and reliability of generative classifiers in safety moderation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances model interpretability and generalizability across instruction-tuned models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of deriving interpretable confidence scores from generative language models (LLMs) when applied to multi-label content safety classification. While models like LLaMA Guard are effective for identifying unsafe content and its categories, their generative architecture inherently lacks direct class-level probabilities, which hinders model confidence assessment and performance interpretation. This limitation complicates the setting of dynamic thresholds for content moderation and impedes fine-grained error analysis. This research proposes and evaluates three novel token-level probability estimation approaches to bridge this gap. The aim is to enhance model interpretability and accuracy, and evaluate the generalizability of this framework across different instruction-tuned models. Through extensive experimentation on a synthetically generated, rigorously annotated dataset, it is demonstrated that leveraging token logits significantly improves the interpretability and reliability of generative classifiers, enabling more nuanced content safety moderation.

TL;DR: The study explores DistilBERT for sentiment analysis on Shopee reviews, achieving high accuracy (94.8%) with reduced computation time compared to BERT and SVM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The massive volume of Shopee reviews necessitates efficient computational methods like sentiment analysis to extract customer insights.

Method: Used DistilBERT on a preprocessed dataset of one million English Shopee reviews, evaluating with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: DistilBERT outperformed SVM (90.2%) and was slightly behind BERT (95.3%) in accuracy but reduced computation time by over 55%.

Conclusion: DistilBERT balances accuracy and efficiency, making it ideal for large-scale sentiment analysis in e-commerce.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital commerce has led to the accumulation of a massive number of consumer reviews on online platforms. Shopee, as one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia, receives millions of product reviews every day containing valuable information regarding customer satisfaction and preferences. Manual analysis of these reviews is inefficient, thus requiring a computational approach such as sentiment analysis. This study examines the use of DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer-based deep learning model, for sentiment classification on Shopee product reviews. The dataset used consists of approximately one million English-language reviews that have been preprocessed and trained using the distilbert-base-uncased model. Evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and compared against benchmark models such as BERT and SVM. The results show that DistilBERT achieved an accuracy of 94.8%, slightly below BERT (95.3%) but significantly higher than SVM (90.2%), with computation time reduced by more than 55%. These findings demonstrate that DistilBERT provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for large scale sentiment analysis on e-commerce platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance inclusivity and global applicability of NLP techniques by addressing low-resource languages like Kurdish Sorani.

Method: Developed a NER dataset and tool, comparing classic ML (CRF) and neural systems (BiLSTM).

Result: CRF outperformed BiLSTM (F1-scores: 0.825 vs. 0.706), challenging neural superiority in low-resource NLP.

Conclusion: Classical methods can be more effective than neural architectures in low-resource contexts.

Abstract: This work contributes towards balancing the inclusivity and global applicability of natural language processing techniques by proposing the first 'name entity recognition' dataset for Kurdish Sorani, a low-resource and under-represented language, that consists of 64,563 annotated tokens. It also provides a tool for facilitating this task in this and many other languages and performs a thorough comparative analysis, including classic machine learning models and neural systems. The results obtained challenge established assumptions about the advantage of neural approaches within the context of NLP. Conventional methods, in particular CRF, obtain F1-scores of 0.825, outperforming the results of BiLSTM-based models (0.706) significantly. These findings indicate that simpler and more computationally efficient classical frameworks can outperform neural architectures in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs internally represent linguistic uncertainty in clinical texts, introducing a metric called MSU to measure sensitivity to uncertainty cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs handle linguistic uncertainty is crucial for their reliable use in clinical decision-making.

Method: Curated a contrastive dataset of clinical statements with varying epistemic modality and proposed MSU, a layerwise probing metric.

Result: LLMs show structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, with epistemic information encoded deeper.

Conclusion: The findings enhance interpretability and reliability of LLMs in clinical settings by revealing their internal representation of linguistic uncertainty.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, where sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty can influence diagnostic interpretation and decision-making. Yet little is known about where such epistemic cues are internally represented within these models. Distinct from uncertainty quantification, which measures output confidence, this work examines input-side representational sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty in medical text. We curate a contrastive dataset of clinical statements varying in epistemic modality (e.g., 'is consistent with' vs. 'may be consistent with') and propose Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric that quantifies activation-level shifts induced by uncertainty cues. Our results show that LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, suggesting that epistemic information is progressively encoded in deeper layers. These findings reveal how linguistic uncertainty is internally represented in LLMs, offering insight into their interpretability and epistemic reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic study explores causes of performance differences in translators for ultra-low resource languages, finding language differences likely outweigh training factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why similar methodologies yield different performances in translators for ultra-low resource languages.

Method: Examined cleaning procedures, pre-trained model limitations, model size, and training dataset size across translation directions for two Brazilian Indigenous languages.

Result: Found minimal influence from training factors, suggesting language differences are more impactful.

Conclusion: Language characteristics may be a key factor in translator performance via fine-tuning pre-trained models.

Abstract: Finetuning pre-trained language models with small amounts of data is a commonly-used method to create translators for ultra-low resource languages such as endangered Indigenous languages. However, previous works have reported substantially different performances with translators created using similar methodology and data. In this work we systematically explored possible causes of the performance difference, aiming to determine whether it was a product of different cleaning procedures, limitations of the pre-trained models, the size of the base model, or the size of the training dataset, studying both directions of translation. Our studies, using two Brazilian Indigenous languages, related but with significant structural linguistic characteristics, indicated none or very limited influence from those training factors, suggesting differences between languages may play a significant role in the ability to produce translators by fine-tuning pre-trained models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain generalization in spoken dialogue state tracking (DST) by leveraging easily obtained textual DST data alongside limited spoken DST data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and the difficulty of handling speech input hinder end-to-end spoken DST. Existing methods struggle with cross-domain generalization and require costly annotated spoken data for each domain.

Method: The authors propose joint training using available spoken DST data and textual DST data from other domains to improve cross-domain performance without needing spoken data for target domains.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in achieving cross-domain DST performance without relying on spoken training data from target domains.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully mitigates the limitations of data scarcity and cross-domain generalization in spoken DST.

Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue state tracking (DST) is made difficult by the tandem of having to handle speech input and data scarcity. Combining speech foundation encoders and large language models has been proposed in recent work as to alleviate some of this difficulty. Although this approach has been shown to result in strong spoken DST models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in realistic multi-turn DST, it struggles to generalize across domains and requires annotated spoken DST training data for each domain of interest. However, collecting such data for every target domain is both costly and difficult. Noting that textual DST data is more easily obtained for various domains, in this work, we propose jointly training on available spoken DST data and written textual data from other domains as a way to achieve cross-domain generalization. We conduct experiments which show the efficacy of our proposed method for getting good cross-domain DST performance without relying on spoken training data from the target domains.

Conclusion: HIL-GPT demonstrates the viability of efficient, domain-specific LLM-based assistants for industrial HIL testing, challenging the 'bigger is better' mindset.

Abstract: Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing is essential for automotive validation but suffers from fragmented and underutilized test artifacts. This paper presents HIL-GPT, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system integrating domain-adapted large language models (LLMs) with semantic retrieval. HIL-GPT leverages embedding fine-tuning using a domain-specific dataset constructed via heuristic mining and LLM-assisted synthesis, combined with vector indexing for scalable, traceable test case and requirement retrieval. Experiments show that fine-tuned compact models, such as \texttt{bge-base-en-v1.5}, achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy, latency, and cost compared to larger models, challenging the notion that bigger is always better. An A/B user study further confirms that RAG-enhanced assistants improve perceived helpfulness, truthfulness, and satisfaction over general-purpose LLMs. These findings provide insights for deploying efficient, domain-aligned LLM-based assistants in industrial HIL environments.

TL;DR: LLMs are tested for direct ontology matching, enhanced by fine-tuning and synthetic data generation, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve LLMs' capability in ontology matching tasks, addressing the lack of training data.

Method: Uses search space reduction and prompt construction, plus synthetic dataset generation for fine-tuning LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs outperform base models in ontology matching tasks across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic data generation with fine-tuning effectively adapts LLMs for ontology matching.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various components of Ontology Matching pipelines. This paper investigates the capability of LLMs to perform ontology matching directly on ontology modules and generate the corresponding alignments. Furthermore, it is explored how a dedicated fine-tuning strategy can enhance the model's matching performance in a zero-shot setting. The proposed method incorporates a search space reduction technique to select relevant subsets from both source and target ontologies, which are then used to automatically construct prompts. Recognizing the scarcity of reference alignments for training, a novel LLM-based approach is introduced for generating a synthetic dataset. This process creates a corpus of ontology submodule pairs and their corresponding reference alignments, specifically designed to fine-tune an LLM for the ontology matching task. The proposed approach was evaluated on the Conference, Geolink, Enslaved, Taxon, and Hydrography datasets from the OAEI complex track. The results demonstrate that the LLM fine-tuned on the synthetically generated data exhibits superior performance compared to the non-fine-tuned base model. The key contribution is a strategy that combines automatic dataset generation with fine-tuning to effectively adapt LLMs for ontology matching tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel transliteration dataset for Hindi and Bengali to improve Romanized script conversion, addressing gaps in diversity and low-resource adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing transliteration techniques is crucial for NLP tasks, especially in South Asian contexts where Romanized scripts pose challenges for multilingual models.

Method: A custom multilingual seq2seq LLM based on Marian architecture is pre-trained using a new transliteration dataset (1.8M Hindi and 1M Bengali pairs).

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in BLEU and CER metrics compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model effectively address limitations in transliteration for Indo-Aryan languages, improving performance in NLP applications.

Abstract: The development of robust transliteration techniques to enhance the effectiveness of transforming Romanized scripts into native scripts is crucial for Natural Language Processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, speech recognition, information retrieval, and intelligent personal assistants. Despite significant advancements, state-of-the-art multilingual models still face challenges in handling Romanized script, where the Roman alphabet is adopted to represent the phonetic structure of diverse languages. Within the South Asian context, where the use of Romanized script for Indo-Aryan languages is widespread across social media and digital communication platforms, such usage continues to pose significant challenges for cutting-edge multilingual models. While a limited number of transliteration datasets and models are available for Indo-Aryan languages, they generally lack sufficient diversity in pronunciation and spelling variations, adequate code-mixed data for large language model (LLM) training, and low-resource adaptation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel transliteration dataset for two popular Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi and Bengali, which are ranked as the 3rd and 7th most spoken languages worldwide. Our dataset comprises nearly 1.8 million Hindi and 1 million Bengali transliteration pairs. In addition to that, we pre-train a custom multilingual seq2seq LLM based on Marian architecture using the developed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to existing relevant models in terms of BLEU and CER metrics.

Conclusion: Contributes a high-quality annotated dataset for MI and critical insights for LLMs' use in complex behavioral therapy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential across both general and domain-specific tasks. However, there is a growing concern regarding their lack of sensitivity, factual incorrectness in responses, inconsistent expressions of empathy, bias, hallucinations, and overall inability to capture the depth and complexity of human understanding, especially in low-resource and sensitive domains such as psychology. To address these challenges, our study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in psychotherapy. We use LLMs to generate precise summaries of motivational interviewing (MI) dialogues and design a two-stage annotation scheme based on key components of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework, namely evocation, collaboration, autonomy, direction, empathy, and a non-judgmental attitude. Using expert-annotated MI dialogues as ground truth, we formulate multi-class classification tasks to assess model performance under progressive prompting techniques, incorporating one-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results offer insights into LLMs' capacity for understanding complex psychological constructs and highlight best practices to mitigate ``semantic drift" in therapeutic settings. Our work contributes not only to the MI community by providing a high-quality annotated dataset to address data scarcity in low-resource domains but also critical insights for using LLMs for precise contextual interpretation in complex behavioral therapy.

*Yuya Ishihara,Atsushi Keyaki,Hiroaki Yamada,Ryutaro Ohara,Mihoko Sumida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper outlines key components for a RAG-based LLM system to support Japanese medical litigation, focusing on legal compliance and expert role substitution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a RAG-based LLM system that can replace human expert commissioners in legal procedures while adhering to strict legal norms.

Method: Proposes three requirements: retrieval of appropriate external knowledge, context-faithful responses, and timestamped references.

Result: Discusses a system design meeting these requirements for legal compliance.

Conclusion: A properly designed RAG-based LLM can effectively support litigation by adhering to legal norms.

Abstract: This study discusses the essential components that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLM system should possess in order to support Japanese medical litigation procedures complying with legal norms. In litigation, expert commissioners, such as physicians, architects, accountants, and engineers, provide specialized knowledge to help judges clarify points of dispute. When considering the substitution of these expert roles with a RAG-based LLM system, the constraint of strict adherence to legal norms is imposed. Specifically, three requirements arise: (1) the retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to the disputed issues in accordance with the principle prohibiting the use of private knowledge, (2) the responses generated must originate from the context provided by the RAG and remain faithful to that context, and (3) the retrieval module must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues at hand. This paper discusses the design of a RAG-based LLM system that satisfies these requirements.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to provide fine-grained error analysis in K-12 English writing, introducing the FEANEL Benchmark with annotated essays, and finds significant gaps in their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' potential for educational applications, especially fine-grained feedback in English writing for K-12 students, remains inadequately explored.

Method: The FEANEL Benchmark includes 1,000 annotated essays and a taxonomy. LLMs are evaluated on their error analysis and pedagogical skills using this benchmark.

Result: Experiments show LLMs lack fine-grained error analysis capabilities, indicating a need for improved methods in educational contexts.

Conclusion: Current LLMs fall short in fine-grained error analysis for education, underscoring the necessity for further advancements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, offering profound opportunities for educational applications. However, their ability to provide fine-grained educational feedback for K-12 English writing remains underexplored. In this paper, we challenge the error analysis and pedagogical skills of LLMs by introducing the problem of Fine-grained Error Analysis for English Learners and present the Fine-grained Error ANalysis for English Learners (FEANEL) Benchmark. The benchmark comprises 1,000 essays written by elementary and secondary school students, and a well-developed English writing error taxonomy. Each error is annotated by language education experts and categorized by type, severity, and explanatory feedback, using a part-of-speech-based taxonomy they co-developed. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on the FEANEL Benchmark to explore their error analysis and pedagogical abilities. Experimental results reveal significant gaps in current LLMs' ability to perform fine-grained error analysis, highlighting the need for advancements in particular methods for educational applications.

*Anh Nguyen,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes LED-WM, a language-conditioned world model improving policy generalization without relying on planning or expert demonstrations, outperforming baselines in unseen games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human-agent interaction by understanding dynamics-descriptive language, addressing limitations of existing methods like reliance on expert demonstrations or planning.

Method: Introduces LED-WM, a model-based reinforcement learning approach with a language-aware encoder grounded via attention, trained through environment interaction.

Result: LED-WM policies generalize better to novel dynamics and language in unseen games (MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM) and can be fine-tuned using synthetic trajectories.

Conclusion: LED-WM advances policy generalization in language-conditioned world models, offering practical improvements without restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying "what to do". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.

### [278] [Visual Puns from Idioms: An Iterative LLM-T2IM-MLLM Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22943)
*Kelaiti Xiao,Liang Yang,Dongyu Zhang,Paerhati Tulajiang,Hongfei Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an iterative framework combining LLMs, T2IMs, and MLLMs to generate and evaluate idiom-based visual puns automatically. It benchmarks performance across models and creates a dataset of 1,000 visual pun images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the intersection of idioms' literal and figurative meanings through visual puns and demonstrate the capability of AI models in generating and understanding such complex visual-language tasks.

Method: An iterative framework coordinates LLMs (prompt generation), T2IMs (image synthesis), and MLLMs (idiom inference and evaluation). The process refines prompts until recognition succeeds or limits are reached.

Result: Generated a dataset of 1,000 visual pun images. Found MLLMs (GPT, Gemini, Gemma) drive performance, with GPT leading. Claude excels in prompt generation among LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates visual pun generation and evaluation, highlighting MLLM performance disparities and the potential for open-source models like Gemma to compete with closed ones.

Abstract: We study idiom-based visual puns--images that align an idiom's literal and figurative meanings--and present an iterative framework that coordinates a large language model (LLM), a text-to-image model (T2IM), and a multimodal LLM (MLLM) for automatic generation and evaluation. Given an idiom, the system iteratively (i) generates detailed visual prompts, (ii) synthesizes an image, (iii) infers the idiom from the image, and (iv) refines the prompt until recognition succeeds or a step limit is reached. Using 1,000 idioms as inputs, we synthesize a corresponding dataset of visual pun images with paired prompts, enabling benchmarking of both generation and understanding. Experiments across 10 LLMs, 10 MLLMs, and one T2IM (Qwen-Image) show that MLLM choice is the primary performance driver: GPT achieves the highest accuracies, Gemini follows, and the best open-source MLLM (Gemma) is competitive with some closed models. On the LLM side, Claude attains the strongest average performance for prompt generation.

TL;DR: FLy is a training-free speculative decoding method that improves inference speed of LLMs with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high inference latency in LLMs caused by autoregressive generation and overcome limitations of strict verification in Speculative Decoding.

Method: Introduces Training-Free Loosely Speculative Decoding (FLy) with a two-tier mechanism (entropy-level gate and token-level deferred window) and multi-level acceleration.

Result: Achieves 2.81x-5.07x speedup on Llama models with >99% accuracy retention and outperforms EAGLE-3 by 1.62x on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: FLy offers efficient, generalized acceleration for LLMs without requiring training, maintaining high accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but suffer from high inference latency due to their autoregressive generation. Speculative Decoding (SPD) mitigates this issue by verifying candidate tokens in parallel from a smaller draft model, yet its strict exact-match verification discards many semantically valid continuations. Moreover, existing training-based SPD methods often suffer from performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To this end, we propose Training-Free Loosely Speculative Decoding (FLy), a novel method that loosens the rigid verification criterion by leveraging the target model's self-corrective behavior to judge whether a draft-target mismatch remains semantically valid. FLy introduces a two-tier mechanism: an entropy-level gate that identifies whether the current token allows multiple plausible alternatives or is nearly deterministic, and a token-level deferred window that distinguishes genuine errors from differently worded yet semantically correct variants. To further reduce latency, we design a multi-level acceleration strategy that accelerates not only the target model but also the drafter itself. Owing to its training-free design, FLy composes seamlessly with arbitrary draft-target pairs and generalizes across models and domains without hyperparameter re-tuning. Experiments show that FLy preserves more than 99% of the target model's accuracy while achieving an average 2.81x speedup on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and 5.07x speedup on the 405B variant. Notably, on out-of-domain datasets, our method remains highly effective and outperforms the training-based method EAGLE-3 by 1.62x.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark Transformer representations for fake news detection and isolate their impact from classifier complexity.

Method: Used frozen pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL) with lightweight classifiers, comparing pooling vs. padding and neural vs. linear heads.

Result: BERT embeddings with logistic regression outperformed neural baselines, showing robustness to truncation and benefits from simple pooling.

Conclusion: Attention-based token encoders are robust foundations for veracity tasks, emphasizing their architecture-centric contributions.

Abstract: This paper investigates fake news detection as a downstream evaluation of Transformer representations, benchmarking encoder-only and decoder-only pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL) as frozen embedders paired with lightweight classifiers. Through controlled preprocessing comparing pooling versus padding and neural versus linear heads, results demonstrate that contextual self-attention encodings consistently transfer effectively. BERT embeddings combined with logistic regression outperform neural baselines on LIAR dataset splits, while analyses of sequence length and aggregation reveal robustness to truncation and advantages from simple max or average pooling. This work positions attention-based token encoders as robust, architecture-centric foundations for veracity tasks, isolating Transformer contributions from classifier complexity.

TL;DR: ShoppingComp is a benchmark evaluating LLMs on product retrieval, report generation, and safety decisions, revealing low performance in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between research benchmarks and real-world deployment by evaluating LLMs on authentic shopping tasks, including safety hazards.

Method: Introduced 120 tasks and 1,026 scenarios curated by experts, focusing on real products and verifiability to test LLMs' capabilities.

Result: Current LLMs perform poorly (e.g., GPT-5 at 11.22%, Gemini-2.5-Flash at 3.92%), highlighting critical errors like unsafe product recommendations.

Conclusion: ShoppingComp sets a new standard for reliable e-commerce agents, exposing significant limitations in LLMs for real-world shopping tasks.

Abstract: We present ShoppingComp, a challenging real-world benchmark for rigorously evaluating LLM-powered shopping agents on three core capabilities: precise product retrieval, expert-level report generation, and safety critical decision making. Unlike prior e-commerce benchmarks, ShoppingComp introduces highly complex tasks under the principle of guaranteeing real products and ensuring easy verifiability, adding a novel evaluation dimension for identifying product safety hazards alongside recommendation accuracy and report quality. The benchmark comprises 120 tasks and 1,026 scenarios, curated by 35 experts to reflect authentic shopping needs. Results reveal stark limitations of current LLMs: even state-of-the-art models achieve low performance (e.g., 11.22% for GPT-5, 3.92% for Gemini-2.5-Flash). These findings highlight a substantial gap between research benchmarks and real-world deployment, where LLMs make critical errors such as failure to identify unsafe product usage or falling for promotional misinformation, leading to harmful recommendations. ShoppingComp fills the gap and thus establishes a new standard for advancing reliable and practical agents in e-commerce.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how spelling variations influence social perceptions in online English writing, comparing human and LLM assessments on formality, carefulness, and age attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs align with human social perceptions of spelling variations, examining linguistic authenticity and model biases.

Method: The study compares human and LLM ratings on spelling variations using sociolinguistic methodology for social attributes.

Result: Strong correlations between human and LLM ratings were found, but notable differences emerged in rating distributions and variation types.

Conclusion: LLMs generally align with human perceptions of spelling variations but show discrepancies in specific contexts, highlighting nuanced differences.

Abstract: Spelling variation (e.g. funnnn vs. fun) can influence the social perception of texts and their writers: we often have various associations with different forms of writing (is the text informal? does the writer seem young?). In this study, we focus on the social perception of spelling variation in online writing in English and study to what extent this perception is aligned between humans and large language models (LLMs). Building on sociolinguistic methodology, we compare LLM and human ratings on three key social attributes of spelling variation (formality, carefulness, age). We find generally strong correlations in the ratings between humans and LLMs. However, notable differences emerge when we analyze the distribution of ratings and when comparing between different types of spelling variation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes interpretable tree-based models integrating five feature categories to classify historical English texts temporally, achieving strong performance across centuries and decades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate dating of historical texts is crucial for organizing and interpreting cultural heritage collections.

Method: Five feature categories (compression-based, lexical structure, readability, neologism detection, distance) are integrated into tree-based models for temporal classification.

Result: Models achieved 76.7% accuracy for century-scale and 26.1% for decade-scale predictions. Performance improved under relaxed precision (96.0% top-2 centuries, 85.8% top-10 decades). Feature importance identified distance and lexical structure as most informative.

Conclusion: Tree-based models offer scalable, interpretable alternatives to neural architectures, though domain adaptation remains challenging.

Abstract: Accurately dating historical texts is essential for organizing and interpreting cultural heritage collections. This article addresses temporal text classification using interpretable, feature-engineered tree-based machine learning models. We integrate five feature categories - compression-based, lexical structure, readability, neologism detection, and distance features - to predict the temporal origin of English texts spanning five centuries. Comparative analysis shows that these feature domains provide complementary temporal signals, with combined models outperforming any individual feature set. On a large-scale corpus, we achieve 76.7% accuracy for century-scale prediction and 26.1% for decade-scale classification, substantially above random baselines (20% and 2.3%). Under relaxed temporal precision, performance increases to 96.0% top-2 accuracy for centuries and 85.8% top-10 accuracy for decades. The final model exhibits strong ranking capabilities with AUCROC up to 94.8% and AUPRC up to 83.3%, and maintains controlled errors with mean absolute deviations of 27 years and 30 years, respectively. For authentication-style tasks, binary models around key thresholds (e.g., 1850-1900) reach 85-98% accuracy. Feature importance analysis identifies distance features and lexical structure as most informative, with compression-based features providing complementary signals. SHAP explainability reveals systematic linguistic evolution patterns, with the 19th century emerging as a pivot point across feature domains. Cross-dataset evaluation on Project Gutenberg highlights domain adaptation challenges, with accuracy dropping by 26.4 percentage points, yet the computational efficiency and interpretability of tree-based models still offer a scalable, explainable alternative to neural architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Big Data from job ads for precise labor demand analysis by integrating SOC classifications.

Method: Developed classifiers using various Language Models for UK ONS SOC and US O*NET SOC, focusing on job titles, descriptions, and skills.

Result: An ensemble model achieved 61% accuracy for SOC tier 4 and 72% for tier 3.

Conclusion: The ensemble model offers a promising tool for real-time labor market analysis using job ad data.

Abstract: Standard Occupational Classifiers (SOC) are systems used to categorize and classify different types of jobs and occupations based on their similarities in terms of job duties, skills, and qualifications. Integrating these facets with Big Data from job advertisement offers the prospect to investigate labour demand that is specific to various occupations. This project investigates the use of recent developments in natural language processing to construct a classifier capable of assigning an occupation code to a given job advertisement. We develop various classifiers for both UK ONS SOC and US O*NET SOC, using different Language Models. We find that an ensemble model, which combines Google BERT and a Neural Network classifier while considering job title, description, and skills, achieved the highest prediction accuracy. Specifically, the ensemble model exhibited a classification accuracy of up to 61% for the lower (or fourth) tier of SOC, and 72% for the third tier of SOC. This model could provide up to date, accurate information on the evolution of the labour market using job advertisements.

TL;DR: The study explores improving translation of Traditional Chinese Medicine texts by using prompt-guided LLMs to better convey metaphors and metonymy, outperforming human and baseline translations across cognitive dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing literal translations of TCM texts hinder understanding and application by failing to reconstruct conceptual networks, prompting a need for more effective methods.

Method: A human-in-the-loop framework with prompt-based cognitive scaffolding guided LLMs to translate key TCM passages, evaluated by simulated readers and structured interviews.

Result: Prompt-adjusted LLM translations scored highest across five cognitive dimensions, showing consistency and better metaphor/metonymy transfer than human or baseline translations.

Conclusion: The study offers a replicable, cognitive-driven HITL method for translating concept-dense texts like TCM, enhancing understanding and application.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient and replicable HITL methodological pathway for translation of ancient, concept-dense texts like TCM.

### [286] [Accent Placement Models for Rigvedic Sanskrit Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23088)
*Akhil Rajeev P,Annarao Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops methods for automatic accent placement in Rigvedic verse, comparing full ByT5 fine-tuning, BiLSTM-CRF, and LoRA-based fine-tuning. Full ByT5 achieves the lowest error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern e-texts of the Rigveda often lack its distinctive pitch-accent marks, which encode melodic and interpretive cues. Restoring these accents computationally can aid philology and pedagogy.

Method: Three strategies are compared: (i) full fine-tuning of ByT5, (ii) BiLSTM-CRF baseline, and (iii) LoRA-based fine-tuning of ByT5. Evaluation uses WER, CER, and DER.

Result: Full ByT5 fine-tuning performs best across all metrics. LoRA offers efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while BiLSTM-CRF serves as a transparent baseline.

Conclusion: The study highlights practical requirements for accent restoration and establishes baselines for future tasks like accent-aware OCR and ASR/chant synthesis.

Abstract: The Rigveda, among the oldest Indian texts in Vedic Sanskrit, employs a distinctive pitch-accent system : udātta, anudātta, svarita whose marks encode melodic and interpretive cues but are often absent from modern e-texts. This work develops a parallel corpus of accented-unaccented ślokas and conducts a controlled comparison of three strategies for automatic accent placement in Rigvedic verse: (i) full fine-tuning of ByT5, a byte-level Transformer that operates directly on Unicode combining marks, (ii) a from-scratch BiLSTM-CRF sequence-labeling baseline, and (iii) LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning atop ByT5.
  Evaluation uses Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) for orthographic fidelity, plus a task-specific Diacritic Error Rate (DER) that isolates accent edits. Full ByT5 fine-tuning attains the lowest error across all metrics; LoRA offers strong efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and BiLSTM-CRF serves as a transparent baseline. The study underscores practical requirements for accent restoration - Unicode-safe preprocessing, mark-aware tokenization, and evaluation that separates grapheme from accent errors - and positions heritage-language technology as an emerging NLP area connecting computational modeling with philological and pedagogical aims. Results establish reproducible baselines for Rigvedic accent restoration and provide guidance for downstream tasks such as accent-aware OCR, ASR/chant synthesis, and digital scholarship.

TL;DR: LLMs evaluated for binary personality prediction using BIG5 show variability in performance; enriched prompts help but introduce bias. Current LLMs aren't ready for APPT without careful design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess suitability of LLMs for automatic personality prediction from text, addressing gaps in zero-shot performance and evaluation reliability.

Method: Test five LLMs (including GPT-4) on three datasets with minimal vs. enriched prompts, focusing on BIG5 traits.

Result: Enriched prompts improve balance but introduce bias; Openness/Agreeableness easier, Extraversion/Neuroticism harder. Aggregate metrics hide asymmetries.

Conclusion: Current LLMs need better design for APPT; prompt coordination, trait framing, and evaluation metrics are crucial.

Abstract: We evaluate large language models (LLMs) for automatic personality prediction from text under the binary Five Factor Model (BIG5). Five models -- including GPT-4 and lightweight open-source alternatives -- are tested across three heterogeneous datasets (Essays, MyPersonality, Pandora) and two prompting strategies (minimal vs. enriched with linguistic and psychological cues). Enriched prompts reduce invalid outputs and improve class balance, but also introduce a systematic bias toward predicting trait presence. Performance varies substantially: Openness and Agreeableness are relatively easier to detect, while Extraversion and Neuroticism remain challenging. Although open-source models sometimes approach GPT-4 and prior benchmarks, no configuration yields consistently reliable predictions in zero-shot binary settings. Moreover, aggregate metrics such as accuracy and macro-F1 mask significant asymmetries, with per-class recall offering clearer diagnostic value. These findings show that current out-of-the-box LLMs are not yet suitable for APPT, and that careful coordination of prompt design, trait framing, and evaluation metrics is essential for interpretable results.

Conclusion: Dripper effectively addresses key challenges in web content extraction, delivering state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently extracting main content from general web pages is of great significance for obtaining training data for large models. Using well-pre-trained decoder-only generative language models offers excellent document comprehension capabilities, thereby effectively enhancing parsing quality. However, it remains constrained by issues such as context window length, inference cost, and format hallucination. We present Dripper, an efficient HTML main content extraction framework powered by lightweight language models, which addresses these challenges through four key innovations: (1) We design a specialized HTML simplification algorithm that reduces input token count to 22\% compared to raw HTML while preserving critical structural information; (2) We reformulate main content extraction as a semantic block sequence classification task, significantly reducing inference cost; (3) We introduce a controlled decoding mechanism that strictly constrains the output space through logits processors, effectively eliminating hallucination issues common in small-scale models; (4) We propose WebMainBench, an evaluation dataset containing over 7,800 web pages with meticulously human-annotated main content extraction labels. Experimental results demonstrate that using only a 0.6B parameter model, Dripper achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation benchmarks and outperforms all baseline methods, attaining an ROUGE-N F1 score of 81.58\%( 83.13\% with fall-back strategy) on our proposed WebMainBench dataset.

### [289] [Multi-chain Graph Refinement and Selection for Reliable Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23136)
*Yujiao Yang,Jing Lian,Linhui Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGRS, a novel reasoning framework addressing limitations in LLM reasoning diversity and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning methods (e.g., ToT, GoT) lack diversity, have redundant search branches, and poor error correction.

Method: MGRS generates diverse reasoning trajectories, refines responses with verification, constructs a reasoning graph, and selects the best answer.

Result: MGRS achieves 82.9% average accuracy and 100% on the 24-point game, with a 13.6x speed-up over baselines.

Conclusion: MGRS significantly enhances LLM reasoning capability and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The complex reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a critical bottleneck for their practical applications. Test-time expansion methods such as Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) enhance reasoning by introducing intermediate reasoning structures, tree search, or graph-based exploration mechanisms. However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%. Remarkably, on the 24-point game, MGRS attains 100% accuracy for the first time, while delivering a 13.6x speed-up compared to the leading Forest of Thoughts framework.

*Neemesh Yadav,Francesco Ortu,Jiarui Liu,Joeun Yook,Bernhard Schölkopf,Rada Mihalcea,Alberto Cazzaniga,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes whether LLMs' refusal to respond to harmful content reflects safety policies or political censorship, introducing the PSP dataset to probe refusal behaviors in explicitly political contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To differentiate between safety-influenced refusals and politically motivated censorship in LLMs, which is currently unclear.

Method: Introduces PSP, a dataset built from censored content (Chinese sensitive prompts and censored tweets), and studies refusal behaviors using data-driven and representation-level approaches, as well as prompt injection attacks.

Result: Most LLMs exhibit some form of censorship, associating it with refusals on content with masked implicit intent.

Conclusion: Identifies major attributes causing shifts in refusal distributions across models and country contexts, highlighting the nuanced nature of LLM refusals.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse to respond to harmful content. However, systematic analyses of whether this behavior is truly a reflection of its safety policies or an indication of political censorship, that is practiced globally by countries, is lacking. Differentiating between safety influenced refusals or politically motivated censorship is hard and unclear. For this purpose we introduce PSP, a dataset built specifically to probe the refusal behaviors in LLMs from an explicitly political context. PSP is built by formatting existing censored content from two data sources, openly available on the internet: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets that have been censored in various countries. We study: 1) impact of political sensitivity in seven LLMs through data-driven (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing the concept of politics); and, 2) vulnerability of models on PSP through prompt injection attacks (PIAs). Associating censorship with refusals on content with masked implicit intent, we find that most LLMs perform some form of censorship. We conclude with summarizing major attributes that can cause a shift in refusal distributions across models and contexts of different countries.

*Wenna Lai,Haoran Xie,Guandong Xu,Qing Li,S. Joe Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reasoning-based generation method and listwise preference optimization framework to improve aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP), addressing limitations of prior marker-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods struggle with modeling relationships among sentiment elements and perform poorly on higher-order elements.

Method: Uses reasoning-based generation with unified templates and introduces listwise preference optimization for better alignment.

Result: Shows improved quadruple prediction accuracy and explanation consistency on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances ASQP by addressing relational reasoning and structural validity.

Abstract: Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) is inherently challenging to predict a structured quadruple with four core sentiment elements, including aspect term (a), aspect category (c), opinion term (o), and sentiment polarity (s). Prior methods relying on marker-based prediction struggle with modeling the intricate relationships among elements and experience sharp performance declines when predicting higher-order elements (e.g., c and s) under standard supervised fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we employ reasoning-based generation to output both the quadruple and a natural language rationale under element prefixes within a unified template, encouraging explicit relational reasoning and interpretability. To further enhance element-wise alignment, we introduce a listwise preference optimization framework for improving structural validity and relational coherence. Specifically, we generate element-wise confusable candidates via syntactic and semantic proximity, then train the model with listwise objectives to prefer the gold candidates over closely competing alternatives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves quadruple prediction accuracy and explanation consistency.

*Guang Liang,Jie Shao,Ningyuan Tang,Xinyao Liu,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TWEO prevents extreme outliers in FP8 training for Transformers via a simple loss term, enabling full-model FP8 pre-training without complex engineering or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme activation outliers hinder FP8 support in modern hardware for training large Transformers. Existing solutions are complex or invasive, and outliers are wrongly assumed to be data-driven.

Method: TWEO introduces a non-invasive loss function to prevent outliers by addressing weight matrix colinearity, reducing outliers significantly.

Result: TWEO enables full-model FP8 pre-training, matches BF16 performance, boosts throughput by 36%, and achieves SOTA performance with W8A8 quantization.

Conclusion: TWEO challenges outlier assumptions and offers a simple solution for efficient FP8 training and quantization in Transformers.

Abstract: Native FP8 support in modern hardware is essential for training large Transformers, but is severely hindered by extreme activation outliers. Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study designs a Hindi QA system for tourism, focusing on Varanasi, using a dataset of 7,715 QA pairs and augmented data. It evaluates BERT and RoBERTa models with SFT and LoRA, finding LoRA efficient (85.3% F1) and RoBERTa better for cultural nuances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of Hindi QA resources for culturally nuanced tourism applications, focusing on Varanasi.

Method: Constructed a Hindi QA dataset, augmented it, and fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa using SFT and LoRA for efficiency and performance.

Result: LoRA reduced trainable parameters by 98% while achieving 85.3% F1. RoBERTa with SFT outperformed BERT in handling cultural terms.

Conclusion: Establishes a baseline for Hindi tourism QA, highlighting LoRA’s efficiency and the need for culturally contextualized NLP.

Abstract: This article presents the first comprehensive study on designing a baseline extractive question-answering (QA) system for the Hindi tourism domain, with a specialized focus on the Varanasi-a cultural and spiritual hub renowned for its Bhakti-Bhaav (devotional ethos). Targeting ten tourism-centric subdomains-Ganga Aarti, Cruise, Food Court, Public Toilet, Kund, Museum, General, Ashram, Temple and Travel, the work addresses the absence of language-specific QA resources in Hindi for culturally nuanced applications. In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting. We propose a framework leveraging foundation models-BERT and RoBERTa, fine-tuned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize parameter efficiency and task performance. Multiple variants of BERT, including pre-trained languages (e.g., Hindi-BERT), are evaluated to assess their suitability for low-resource domain-specific QA. Evaluation metrics - F1, BLEU, and ROUGE-L - highlight trade-offs between answer precision and linguistic fluency. Experiments demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance (85.3\% F1) while reducing trainable parameters by 98\% compared to SFT, striking a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Comparative analysis across models reveals that RoBERTa with SFT outperforms BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances, particularly for culturally embedded terms (e.g., Aarti, Kund). This work establishes a foundational baseline for Hindi tourism QA systems, emphasizing the role of LORA in low-resource settings and underscoring the need for culturally contextualized NLP frameworks in the tourism domain.

### [294] [Behavior-Equivalent Token: Single-Token Replacement for Long Prompts in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23271)
*Jiancheng Dong,Pengyue Jia,Jingyu Peng,Maolin Wang,Yuhao Wang,Lixin Su,Xin Sun,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to replace lengthy system prompts with a single Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]), reducing prompt length by up to 3000x while retaining 98% of original performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long system prompts cause issues like increased latency, computational cost, and reduced context length. The goal is to replace them with shorter tokens without losing performance.

Method: A lightweight three-stage training framework learns a single [BE] token by first encoding the original prompt's content and then distilling its behavior into the token. It requires no model internals, auxiliary models, or labeled data.

Result: Empirical evaluations show a 3000x reduction in prompt length with 98% retained performance, reducing inference cost and freeing up context space.

Conclusion: The proposed [BE] token effectively replaces lengthy prompts, maintaining performance while addressing their drawbacks.

Abstract: Carefully engineered system prompts play a critical role in guiding the behavior of LLM agents, but their considerable length introduces significant drawbacks, including increased inference latency, higher computational cost, and reduced effective context length. This raises the question of whether such lengthy prompts can be replaced by a drastically reduced number of tokens while preserving their behavioral effect on downstream tasks. To enable this, we propose a lightweight three-stage training framework that learns a single prompt-specific Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]). The framework first trains [BE] to encode the natural-language content of the original system prompt via reconstruction, and then distills the prompt 's downstream behavior into this single token. Importantly, our method requires no access to model internals, no auxiliary compression models, and no labeled responses. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that a single [BE] token achieves up to a 3000x reduction in prompt length, while retaining about 98% of the downstream performance of the original system prompts. This substantially reduces inference cost and leaves almost the entire context window available for user inputs.

### [295] [MCP vs RAG vs NLWeb vs HTML: A Comparison of the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Different Agent Interfaces to the Web (Technical Report)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23281)
*Aaron Steiner,Ralph Peeters,Christian Bizer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of four web interaction interfaces (HTML, RAG, MCP, NLWeb) for LLM agents shows RAG, MCP, and NLWeb outperform HTML in effectiveness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comparison among different web interaction interfaces (HTML, RAG, MCP, NLWeb) for LLM agents within a controlled environment.

Method: Developed a testbed with four simulated e-shops offering products via HTML, MCP, and NLWeb interfaces. Specialized agents performed identical tasks (e.g., product search, checkout) using GPT 4.1, GPT 5, GPT 5 mini, and Claude Sonnet 4.

Result: RAG, MCP, and NLWeb agents outperformed HTML in F1 score (0.75-0.77 vs. 0.67), token usage (47k-140k vs. 241k), and runtime (50-62s vs. 291s). RAG with GPT 5 achieved the best F1 (0.87) and completion rate (0.79).

Conclusion: The choice of interaction interface significantly impacts LLM-based web agents' effectiveness and efficiency, with RAG emerging as a strong performer.

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used to automate web tasks such as product search, offer comparison, and checkout. Current research explores different interfaces through which these agents interact with websites, including traditional HTML browsing, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over pre-crawled content, communication via Web APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and natural-language querying through the NLWeb interface. However, no prior work has compared these four architectures within a single controlled environment using identical tasks.
  To address this gap, we introduce a testbed consisting of four simulated e-shops, each offering its products via HTML, MCP, and NLWeb interfaces. For each interface (HTML, RAG, MCP, and NLWeb) we develop specialized agents that perform the same sets of tasks, ranging from simple product searches and price comparisons to complex queries for complementary or substitute products and checkout processes. We evaluate the agents using GPT 4.1, GPT 5, GPT 5 mini, and Claude Sonnet 4 as underlying LLM. Our evaluation shows that the RAG, MCP and NLWeb agents outperform HTML on both effectiveness and efficiency. Averaged over all tasks, F1 rises from 0.67 for HTML to between 0.75 and 0.77 for the other agents. Token usage falls from about 241k for HTML to between 47k and 140k per task. The runtime per task drops from 291 seconds to between 50 and 62 seconds. The best overall configuration is RAG with GPT 5 achieving an F1 score of 0.87 and a completion rate of 0.79. Also taking cost into consideration, RAG with GPT 5 mini offers a good compromise between API usage fees and performance. Our experiments show the choice of the interaction interface has a substantial impact on both the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-based web agents.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) for ultra-long context modeling, achieving high accuracy on tasks with contexts up to 16M.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of building machines with long-term memory by ensuring sparsity, random-access flexibility, and length generalization in context modeling.

Method: Introduces HSA-UltraLong, an 8B-parameter MoE model using HSA, trained on 8T tokens and evaluated on various tasks with different context lengths.

Result: Performs comparably to full-attention baselines on in-domain lengths and achieves over 90% accuracy on most retrieval tasks with 16M contexts.

Conclusion: Provides insights and a foundation for future research in ultra-long context modeling.

Abstract: This work explores the challenge of building ``Machines that Can Remember'', framing long-term memory as the problem of efficient ultra-long context modeling. We argue that this requires three key properties: \textbf{sparsity}, \textbf{random-access flexibility}, and \textbf{length generalization}. To address ultra-long-context modeling, we leverage Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA), a novel attention mechanism that satisfies all three properties. We integrate HSA into Transformers to build HSA-UltraLong, which is an 8B-parameter MoE model trained on over 8 trillion tokens and is rigorously evaluated on different tasks with in-domain and out-of-domain context lengths to demonstrate its capability in handling ultra-long contexts. Results show that our model performs comparably to full-attention baselines on in-domain lengths while achieving over 90\% accuracy on most in-context retrieval tasks with contexts up to 16M. This report outlines our experimental insights and open problems, contributing a foundation for future research in ultra-long context modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses methods for early detection of gambling disorder risk using social media data, achieving top results in a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early detection of gambling disorder by analyzing social media activity, addressing predictive accuracy and decision speed.

Method: Three approaches using CPI+DMC framework with SS3, BERT (extended vocabulary), and SBERT models, plus historical user analysis.

Result: Two methods ranked top in the challenge, excelling in decision metrics but struggling to clearly differentiate high/low-risk users.

Conclusion: Further work is needed to enhance data interpretation and build more reliable early risk detection systems for mental disorders.

Abstract: Gambling disorder is a complex behavioral addiction that is challenging to understand and address, with severe physical, psychological, and social consequences. Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web has become a key task in the scientific community for identifying early signs of mental health behaviors based on social media activity. This work presents our participation in the MentalRiskES 2025 challenge, specifically in Task 1, aimed at classifying users at high or low risk of developing a gambling-related disorder. We proposed three methods based on a CPI+DMC approach, addressing predictive effectiveness and decision-making speed as independent objectives. The components were implemented using the SS3, BERT with extended vocabulary, and SBERT models, followed by decision policies based on historical user analysis. Although it was a challenging corpus, two of our proposals achieved the top two positions in the official results, performing notably in decision metrics. Further analysis revealed some difficulty in distinguishing between users at high and low risk, reinforcing the need to explore strategies to improve data interpretation and quality, and to promote more transparent and reliable ERD systems for mental disorders.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter to enhance text generation by leveraging a two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, improving interpretability and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of interpretability in language models hinders their practical usability, especially in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks requiring reliability and explainability.

Method: The approach uses a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network to select relevant knowledge.

Result: The model achieves high interpretability and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like RotoWireFG and KdConv.

Conclusion: Combining language models' generative ability with structured knowledge hunting enhances interpretability and performance in text generation tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge-enhanced text generation aims to enhance the quality of generated text by utilizing internal or external knowledge sources. While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces large-scale self-supervised models trained exclusively on African speech, addressing the under-representation of African languages in multilingual speech processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African languages are under-represented in speech processing research and deployed systems, especially for large, open-weight encoders that perform well under low-resource conditions.

Method: The authors develop and release large models (SSA-HuBERT-Large and SSA-HuBERT-XL) trained solely on African speech, alongside a BASE counterpart, and conduct experiments on ASR and LID tasks for Sub-Saharan languages.

Result: Larger architectures significantly improve performance by effectively utilizing large audio datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the benefits of larger models for African speech processing and releases open-weight models to support further research.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multilingual speech processing, African languages remain under-represented in both research and deployed systems, particularly when it comes to strong, open-weight encoders that transfer well under low-resource supervision. Self-supervised learning has proven especially promising in such settings, yet most publicly released models targeting African speech remain at BASE scale, leaving unanswered whether larger encoders, trained exclusively on Africa-centric audio, offer tangible benefits and how model capacity interacts with data composition. This work addresses that gap by introducing SSA-HuBERT-Large (317M parameters) and SSA-HuBERT-XL (964M parameters), the first large models trained solely on African speech, alongside a BASE size counterpart. We release these models as open weights: see https://huggingface.co/collections/Orange/african-speech-foundation-models. By conducting a carefully controlled experimental study focused exclusively on Sub-Saharan languages, covering automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language identification (LID) tasks, we demonstrate that larger architectures significantly improve performance by effectively leveraging large audio datasets.

*Alexander Sergeev,Evgeny Kotelnikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-based method to identify key attention heads in multimodal language models (MLMs) for efficient fine-tuning, improving image captioning performance by focusing on critical components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of MLMs is computationally expensive, and their complexity makes it hard to identify effective components for balancing efficiency and performance.

Method: An attention-based interpretability method analyzes attention scores to identify heads focusing on image key objects, quantified by Head Impact (HI) scores, guiding Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT).

Result: Fine-tuning layers with the highest HI scores improves image understanding significantly, even with minimal parameter adjustments (~0.01%).

Conclusion: Focusing PEFT on attention heads critical for key object recognition enhances MLM performance efficiently.

Abstract: Modern large language models become multimodal, analyzing various data formats like text and images. While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by training only a small portion of model weights. However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities.

TL;DR: AAO improves DPO by addressing ambiguity in preference pairs through semantic similarity re-weighting, outperforming DPO by up to 15.0 points on Arena-Hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguous content in DPO training limits alignment improvements, prompting the need for ambiguity-aware optimization.

Method: Introduces AAO, which re-weights ambiguous content using semantic similarity calculations from preference pairs.

Result: AAO outperforms DPO by up to 8.9 points on AlpacaEval 2 and 15.0 points on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: AAO effectively reduces ambiguities and enhances performance without significantly increasing response length.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) method across various domains. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of token importance in improving DPO effectiveness. It is observed that identical or semantically similar content (defined as ambiguous content) frequently appears within the preference pairs. We hypothesize that the presence of ambiguous content during DPO training may introduce ambiguity, thereby limiting further improvements in alignment. Through mathematical analysis and proof-of-concept experiments, we reveal that ambiguous content may potentially introduce ambiguities, thereby degrading performance. To address this issue, we introduce Ambiguity Awareness Optimization (AAO), a simple yet effective approach that automatically re-weights ambiguous content to reduce ambiguities by calculating semantic similarity from preference pairs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AAO consistently and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in performance, without markedly increasing response length, across multiple model scales and widely adopted benchmark datasets, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard. Specifically, AAO outperforms DPO by up to 8.9 points on AlpacaEval 2 and achieves an improvement of by up to 15.0 points on Arena-Hard.

TL;DR: AgentShield is a distributed framework for decentralized auditing in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems, addressing vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks with a three-layer defense optimizing robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against adversarial attacks in MAS are inefficient or create single points of failure, prompting the need for a balanced solution.

Method: AgentShield uses Critical Node Auditing, Light Token Auditing, and Two-Round Consensus Auditing to decentralize and optimize defenses.

Result: Achieves 92.5% recovery rate and reduces auditing overhead by over 70% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AgentShield successfully balances robustness and efficiency in defending MAS against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer powerful cooperative reasoning but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where compromised agents can undermine the system's overall performance. Existing defenses either depend on single trusted auditors, creating single points of failure, or sacrifice efficiency for robustness. To resolve this tension, we propose \textbf{AgentShield}, a distributed framework for efficient, decentralized auditing. AgentShield introduces a novel three-layer defense: \textbf{(i) Critical Node Auditing} prioritizes high-influence agents via topological analysis; \textbf{(ii) Light Token Auditing} implements a cascade protocol using lightweight sentry models for rapid discriminative verification; and \textbf{(iii) Two-Round Consensus Auditing} triggers heavyweight arbiters only upon uncertainty to ensure global agreement. This principled design optimizes the robustness-efficiency trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that AgentShield achieves a 92.5\% recovery rate and reduces auditing overhead by over 70\% compared to existing methods, maintaining high collaborative accuracy across diverse MAS topologies and adversarial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores how hyperparameters affect cross-play in Hanabi, focusing on entropy regularization's role in ensuring policy compatibility.

Result: Achieved superior cross-play scores, surpassing specialized algorithms. Identified limitations in policy gradient methods.

Conclusion: While hyperparameter tuning improves cross-play, new algorithms are still needed for zero-shot coordination in certain Dec-POMDPs.

Abstract: We find that in Hanabi, one of the most complex and popular benchmarks for zero-shot coordination and ad-hoc teamplay, a standard implementation of independent PPO with a slightly higher entropy coefficient 0.05 instead of the typically used 0.01, achieves a new state-of-the-art in cross-play between different seeds, beating by a significant margin all previous specialized algorithms, which were specifically designed for this setting. We provide an intuition for why sufficiently high entropy regularization ensures that different random seed produce joint policies which are mutually compatible. We also empirically find that a high $λ_{\text{GAE}}$ around 0.9, and using RNNs instead of just feed-forward layers in the actor-critic architecture, strongly increase inter-seed cross-play. While these results demonstrate the dramatic effect that hyperparameters can have not just on self-play scores but also on cross-play scores, we show that there are simple Dec-POMDPs though, in which standard policy gradient methods with increased entropy regularization are not able to achieve perfect inter-seed cross-play, thus demonstrating the continuing necessity for new algorithms for zero-shot coordination.

TL;DR: A machine learning model (MARS-S2L) detects methane emissions from satellite imagery, enabling targeted emissions reductions by identifying major sources efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane is a major greenhouse gas, and targeting large point sources can significantly reduce emissions, but current detection methods are inadequate.

Method: MARS-S2L uses multispectral satellite imagery and a manually curated dataset of over 80,000 images to detect methane plumes with high resolution and frequency.

Result: The model detects 78% of plumes with an 8% false positive rate, has issued 1,015 notifications, and enabled mitigation at six persistent sites, including a new one in Libya.

Conclusion: MARS-S2L provides a scalable solution for detecting and mitigating methane emissions, demonstrating practical impact.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for roughly 30\% of warming since pre-industrial times. A small number of large point sources account for a disproportionate share of emissions, creating an opportunity for substantial reductions by targeting relatively few sites. Detection and attribution of large emissions at scale for notification to asset owners remains challenging. Here, we introduce MARS-S2L, a machine learning model that detects methane emissions in publicly available multispectral satellite imagery. Trained on a manually curated dataset of over 80,000 images, the model provides high-resolution detections every two days, enabling facility-level attribution and identifying 78\% of plumes with an 8\% false positive rate at 697 previously unseen sites. Deployed operationally, MARS-S2L has issued 1,015 notifications to stakeholders in 20 countries, enabling verified, permanent mitigation of six persistent emitters, including a previously unknown site in Libya. These results demonstrate a scalable pathway from satellite detection to quantifiable methane mitigation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AUTO is an LLM agent framework for design optimization, achieving competitive results in GPU code optimization with high search efficiency and cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with ill-defined design spaces, and LLMs offer a dynamic alternative by leveraging domain knowledge.

Method: AUTO uses two agents: a Strategist for selecting exploration/exploitation strategies and an Implementor for executing designs, treating optimization as gradient-free search.

Result: AUTO achieves 50-70% search efficiency vs. Bayesian optimization, completing tasks in ~8 hours at up to $159/run vs. $480 with developers.

Conclusion: AUTO demonstrates potential for automating optimization in ill-defined spaces with limited prior information.

Abstract: Traditional optimization methods excel in well-defined search spaces but struggle with design problems where transformations and design parameters are difficult to define. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by dynamically interpreting design spaces and leveraging encoded domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce AUTO, an LLM agent framework that treats design optimization as a gradient-free search problem guided by strategic LLM reasoning. The framework employs two collaborative agents: a Strategist that selects between exploration and exploitation strategies, and an Implementor that executes detailed designs. Applied to GPU code optimization -- a domain critical to fields from machine learning to scientific computing -- AUTO generates solutions competitive with expert implementations for chemical kinetics integration and dense matrix multiplication. The framework achieves 50-70% search efficiency relative to Bayesian optimization methodologies. It completes optimizations in approximately 8 hours at an estimated cost of up to \$159 per run, compared to an estimated cost of up to \$480 with median-wage software developers. These findings open the door to automating design optimization in ill-defined search spaces with limited prior information.

*Chi Zhang,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PISNN, a Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network, combining SNNs' efficiency with PINNs' physical constraints to achieve real-time, energy-efficient predictions while ensuring strict physical conservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of energy-intensive PINNs and the degradation of physical fidelity in SNNs for real-time, low-power edge computing.

Method: Develops PISNN with C-LIF neurons for mass preservation and CFQ strategy for robust temporal generalization, treating spikes as flux packets.

Result: PISNN outperforms benchmarks like the 1D heat and 2D Laplace's equations, maintaining perfect mass conservation.

Conclusion: PISNN merges scientific computing rigor with neuromorphic efficiency, enabling complex, energy-efficient physics predictions.

Abstract: Real-time, physically-consistent predictions on low-power edge devices is critical for the next generation embodied AI systems, yet it remains a major challenge. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine data-driven learning with physics-based constraints to ensure the model's predictions are with underlying physical principles.However, PINNs are energy-intensive and struggle to strictly enforce physical conservation laws. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for edge computing and real-time processing. However, naively converting PINNs to SNNs degrades physical fidelity and fails to address long-term generalization issues. To this end, this paper introduce a novel Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework. Importantly, to ensure strict physical conservation, we design the Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neuron, whose dynamics structurally guarantee local mass preservation. To achieve robust temporal generalization, we introduce a novel Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy, which redefines neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux. Our CFQ learns a time-invariant physical evolution operator, enabling the PISNN to become a general-purpose solver -- conservative-by-construction. Extensive experiments show that our PISNN excels on diverse benchmarks. For both the canonical 1D heat equation and the more challenging 2D Laplace's Equation, it accurately simulates the system dynamics while maintaining perfect mass conservation by design -- a feat that is challenging for conventional PINNs. This work establishes a robust framework for fusing the rigor of scientific computing with the efficiency of neuromorphic engineering, paving the way for complex, long-term, and energy-efficient physics predictions for intelligent systems.

TL;DR: DINR addresses spectral bias in INRs by modeling feature evolution as a continuous-time dynamical system, improving expressivity and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral bias limits INRs' ability to capture high-frequency details.

Method: DINR treats feature evolution as a continuous-time dynamical system, enhancing frequency representation.

Result: DINR shows stable convergence, higher fidelity, and better generalization compared to static INRs.

Conclusion: DINR outperforms static INRs by mitigating spectral bias through dynamic feature evolution.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a powerful continuous framework for modeling complex visual and geometric signals, but spectral bias remains a fundamental challenge, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details. Orthogonal to existing remedy strategies, we introduce Dynamical Implicit Neural Representations (DINR), a new INR modeling framework that treats feature evolution as a continuous-time dynamical system rather than a discrete stack of layers. This dynamical formulation mitigates spectral bias by enabling richer, more adaptive frequency representations through continuous feature evolution. Theoretical analysis based on Rademacher complexity and the Neural Tangent Kernel demonstrates that DINR enhances expressivity and improves training dynamics. Moreover, regularizing the complexity of the underlying dynamics provides a principled way to balance expressivity and generalization. Extensive experiments on image representation, field reconstruction, and data compression confirm that DINR delivers more stable convergence, higher signal fidelity, and stronger generalization than conventional static INRs.

TL;DR: A threshold-based multiclass classification framework replaces softmax's probabilistic interpretation with a geometric one, enabling performance improvement through threshold tuning and introducing multiclass ROC analysis via ROC clouds and DFP score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to generalize the argmax rule in multiclass classification by introducing a geometric interpretation of softmax outputs, allowing for posterior optimization of classification scores through threshold tuning.

Method: The proposed framework replaces probabilistic softmax outputs with a geometric interpretation on the simplex. Classification relies on multidimensional thresholds, enabling threshold tuning similar to binary settings. Multiclass ROC analysis is introduced using ROC clouds and summarized with a DFP score.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that multidimensional threshold tuning improves performance across various networks and datasets. The multiclass ROC analysis aligns with observed tuning gains.

Conclusion: The framework provides a coherent alternative to standard OvR curves, enhancing prediction capability through threshold tuning and geometric interpretation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a threshold-based framework for multiclass classification that generalizes the standard argmax rule. This is done by replacing the probabilistic interpretation of softmax outputs with a geometric one on the multidimensional simplex, where the classification depends on a multidimensional threshold. This change of perspective enables for any trained classification network an \textit{a posteriori} optimization of the classification score by means of threshold tuning, as usually carried out in the binary setting, thus allowing for a further refinement of the prediction capability of any network. Our experiments show indeed that multidimensional threshold tuning yields performance improvements across various networks and datasets. Moreover, we derive a multiclass ROC analysis based on \emph{ROC clouds} -- the attainable (FPR,TPR) operating points induced by a single multiclass threshold -- and summarize them via a \emph{Distance From Point} (DFP) score to $(0,1)$. This yields a coherent alternative to standard One-vs-Rest (OvR) curves and aligns with the observed tuning gains.

*Finn G. Vamosi,Nils D. Forkert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-agent debate framework for causal inference, where two models critique and refine each other's reasoning, significantly improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance causal reasoning by mimicking human-like internal dialogue, where multiple hypotheses are debated to reach the best explanation.

Method: Uses a dual-agent debate framework involving reasoning language models (Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1) to critique and revise causal inferences.

Result: Multi-agent debate improved DeepSeek-R1's accuracy from 78.03% to 87.45%, Qwen3's from 84.16% to 89.41%, with notable gains in counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: Debate frameworks leveraging reasoning models enhance causal inference, showing the value of diverse perspectives in problem-solving.

Abstract: When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing "what if" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents. Our results highlight the potential of reasoning models as building blocks for multi-agent systems in causal inference, and demonstrate the importance of diverse perspectives in causal problem-solving.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how Rashomon sets in ML pipelines impact trustworthiness, balancing robustness and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the trustworthiness implications of multiple near-optimal models produced by ML pipelines.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical studies of sparse decision trees and linear models.

Result: Sparse models preserve privacy but are fragile; Rashomon sets offer robustness against attacks and stability under shifts but increase data leakage.

Conclusion: Rashomon sets present a trade-off between robustness and privacy, serving as both a resource and a risk.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines rarely produce a single model; instead, they produce a Rashomon set of many near-optimal ones. We show that this multiplicity reshapes key aspects of trustworthiness. At the individual-model level, sparse interpretable models tend to preserve privacy but are fragile to adversarial attacks. In contrast, the diversity within a large Rashomon set enables reactive robustness: even when an attack breaks one model, others often remain accurate. Rashomon sets are also stable under small distribution shifts. However, this same diversity increases information leakage, as disclosing more near-optimal models provides an attacker with progressively richer views of the training data. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies of sparse decision trees and linear models, we characterize this robustness-privacy trade-off and highlight the dual role of Rashomon sets as both a resource and a risk for trustworthy ML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-agent framework combines an LLM interpreter and neuro-symbolic core for HFMD forecasting, outperforming traditional models with accurate predictions and interpretable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HFMD forecasting models lack semantic reasoning to interpret causal drivers like school calendars and weather, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a two-agent framework: an LLM processes contextual signals into a transmission-impact signal, while a neuro-symbolic core integrates this with historical data for probabilistic forecasts.

Result: Outperforms traditional and foundation-model baselines in accuracy, provides robust prediction intervals (0.85-1.00 coverage), and offers human-interpretable rationales.

Conclusion: Integrating domain knowledge via LLMs enables context-aware HFMD forecasts that align with public health needs while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Effective surveillance of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) requires forecasts accounting for epidemiological patterns and contextual drivers like school calendars and weather. While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM "event interpreter" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

Motivation: Evaluate unsupervised anomaly detection techniques for IoT cybersecurity due to limitations of traditional signature-based systems.

Method: Used TON_IoT thermostat dataset to test IF and OC-SVM with standard and resource metrics.

Result: IF outperformed OC-SVM in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IF is robust and practical for real-time anomaly detection in resource-constrained IoT environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across diverse sectors has significantly enhanced operational efficiency, yet concurrently elevated cybersecurity vulnerabilities due to increased exposure to cyber threats. Given the limitations of traditional signature-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADS) in identifying emerging and zero-day threats, this study investigates the effectiveness of two unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, Isolation Forest (IF) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), using the TON_IoT thermostat dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was performed based on standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) alongside critical resource utilization metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. Experimental results revealed that IF consistently outperformed OC-SVM, achieving higher detection accuracy, superior precision, and recall, along with a significantly better F1-score. Furthermore, Isolation Forest demonstrated a markedly superior computational footprint, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT edge devices. These findings underscore Isolation Forest's robustness in high-dimensional and imbalanced IoT environments and highlight its practical viability for real-time anomaly detection.

Method: Uses kinematics data to create a biomechanical model, implements imitation learning for a forelimb reaching task with GPU acceleration (JAX and Mujoco-MJX).

Result: Adding naturalistic constraints on energy and velocity improves prediction of real EMG signals.

Conclusion: Energy and control constraints are crucial for accurate modeling of musculoskeletal motor control.

Abstract: The brain has evolved to effectively control the body, and in order to understand the relationship we need to model the sensorimotor transformations underlying embodied control. As part of a coordinated effort, we are developing a general-purpose platform for behavior-driven simulation modeling high fidelity behavioral dynamics, biomechanics, and neural circuit architectures underlying embodied control. We present a pipeline for taking kinematics data from the neuroscience lab and creating a pipeline for recapitulating those natural movements in a biomechanical model. We implement a imitation learning framework to perform a dexterous forelimb reaching task with a musculoskeletal model in a simulated physics environment. The mouse arm model is currently training at faster than 1 million training steps per second due to GPU acceleration with JAX and Mujoco-MJX. We present results that indicate that adding naturalistic constraints on energy and velocity lead to simulated musculoskeletal activity that better predict real EMG signals. This work provides evidence to suggest that energy and control constraints are critical to modeling musculoskeletal motor control.

Motivation: To evaluate the trade-off between predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of XGBoost variants for air-quality monitoring.

Method: Used AirQualityUCI dataset; compared full and tiny XGBoost models via MAE, RMSE, MBE, R2, inference time, model size, and RAM usage.

Result: Full XGBoost excels in accuracy, while tiny XGBoost saves resources (faster inference, smaller size) with minor accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Tiny XGBoost is viable for IoT/embedded air-quality monitoring due to its balance of performance and efficiency.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of two variants of the XGBoost regression model, the full-capacity and lightweight (tiny) versions, for predicting the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Using the AirQualityUCI dataset collected over one year in an urban environment, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation based on widely accepted metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). In addition, we assessed resource-oriented metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. The full XGBoost model achieved superior predictive accuracy for both pollutants, while the tiny model, though slightly less precise, offered substantial computational benefits with significantly reduced inference time and model storage requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying simplified models in resource-constrained environments without compromising predictive quality. This makes the tiny XGBoost model suitable for real-time air-quality monitoring in IoT and embedded applications.

Abstract: We present PDE-FM, a modular foundation model for physics-informed machine learning that unifies spatial, spectral, and temporal reasoning across heterogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) systems. PDE-FM combines spatial-spectral tokenization, physics-aware conditioning, and a Mamba-based state-space backbone with an operator-theoretic decoder, enabling scalable and data-efficient modeling of complex physical dynamics. In contrast to task-specific neural operators, PDE-FM is pretrained once on diverse PDE datasets and can be transferred to new physical regimes without architectural or data-specific modifications. Evaluated on twelve 2D and 3D datasets from The Well benchmark - spanning hydrodynamic, radiative, elastic, and astrophysical phenomena - PDE-FM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in six domains, reducing mean VRMSE by 46% relative to prior operator-learning baselines. The model demonstrates robust cross-physics generalization, excelling in turbulent and radiative systems while maintaining strong performance in linear and steady-state regimes.

TL;DR: Equilibrium Transformers (EqT) introduce closed-loop prediction to iteratively refine latent representations, addressing limitations like error propagation in autoregressive transformers and improving performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-loop nature of current autoregressive transformers causes error propagation and failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and planning, prompting the need for iterative refinement.

Method: EqT integrates an Equilibrium Refinement Module into transformers, refining latent representations via gradient descent to minimize a learned energy function enforcing consistency, coherence, and confidence.

Result: Preliminary experiments show significant performance improvements (+3.28% avg., up to +8.07% on hardest sequences) over standard transformers, particularly scaling with task difficulty.

Conclusion: Closed-loop equilibrium addresses autoregressive bottlenecks similarly to how attention resolved sequential ones, marking foundational progress for language models.

Abstract: Contemporary autoregressive transformers operate in open loop: each hidden state is computed in a single forward pass and never revised, causing errors to propagate uncorrected through the sequence. We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting compact, interpretable representations from complex, nonlinear scientific data.

Method: GM-VAE uses block-coordinate descent (alternating EM steps) and introduces a graph-Laplacian smoothness metric for evaluation.

Result: Stable training, physically aligned latent clusters, and smooth manifolds demonstrated on reaction ODEs, wake flows, and combustion images.

Conclusion: GM-VAE provides a robust tool for interpreting turbulent and reactive flow systems.

Abstract: Extracting compact, physically interpretable representations from high-dimensional scientific data is a persistent challenge due to the complex, nonlinear structures inherent in physical systems. We propose a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GM-VAE) framework designed to address this by integrating an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-inspired training scheme with a novel spectral interpretability metric. Unlike conventional VAEs that jointly optimize reconstruction and clustering (often leading to training instability), our method utilizes a block-coordinate descent strategy, alternating between expectation and maximization steps. This approach stabilizes training and naturally aligns latent clusters with distinct physical regimes. To objectively evaluate the learned representations, we introduce a quantitative metric based on graph-Laplacian smoothness, which measures the coherence of physical quantities across the latent manifold. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on datasets of increasing complexity: surface reaction ODEs, Navier-Stokes wake flows, and experimental laser-induced combustion Schlieren images. The results show that our GM-VAE yields smooth, physically consistent manifolds and accurate regime clustering, offering a robust data-driven tool for interpreting turbulent and reactive flow systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how fusion strategies impact model performance (accuracy and latency) in multimodal learning.

Method: Proposes three fusion models (early, intermediate, late) per vision network (MobileNetV2, ViT) within a BERT-vision hybrid framework, evaluated on CMU MOSI dataset and NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX.

Result: Late fusion achieves highest accuracy, while early fusion minimizes latency. Intermediate fusion balances both but doesn't outperform the extremes.

Conclusion: Earlier fusion reduces latency but sacrifices accuracy; choice depends on application needs.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models often combine multiple input streams of data to more accurately capture the information that informs their decisions. In multimodal machine learning, choosing the strategy for fusing data together requires careful consideration of the application's accuracy and latency requirements, as fusing the data at earlier or later stages in the model architecture can lead to performance changes in accuracy and latency. To demonstrate this tradeoff, we investigate different fusion strategies using a hybrid BERT and vision network framework that integrates image and text data. We explore two different vision networks: MobileNetV2 and ViT. We propose three models for each vision network, which fuse data at late, intermediate, and early stages in the architecture. We evaluate the proposed models on the CMU MOSI dataset and benchmark their latency on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. Our experimental results demonstrate that while late fusion yields the highest accuracy, early fusion offers the lowest inference latency. We describe the three proposed model architectures and discuss the accuracy and latency tradeoffs, concluding that data fusion earlier in the model architecture results in faster inference times at the cost of accuracy.

Method: The proposed method uses generative models (e.g., VAEs) to reconstruct inputs and employs generative sampling with consensus-based aggregation to enhance defense.

Result: The approach reduces illusion attack success rates to near-zero and improves cross-modal alignment by 4% (unperturbed) and 11% (perturbed).

Conclusion: The proposed task-agnostic defense effectively counters adversarial illusions and enhances model robustness.

Abstract: Multi-modal foundation models align images, text, and other modalities in a shared embedding space but remain vulnerable to adversarial illusions (Zhang et al., 2025), where imperceptible perturbations disrupt cross-modal alignment and mislead downstream tasks. To counteract the effects of adversarial illusions, we propose a task-agnostic mitigation mechanism that reconstructs the input from the attacker's perturbed input through generative models, e.g., Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to maintain natural alignment. To further enhance our proposed defense mechanism, we adopt a generative sampling strategy combined with a consensus-based aggregation scheme over the outcomes of the generated samples. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art multi-modal encoders show that our approach substantially reduces the illusion attack success rates to near-zero and improves cross-modal alignment by 4% (42 to 46) and 11% (32 to 43) in unperturbed and perturbed input settings respectively, providing an effective and model-agnostic defense against adversarial illusions.

TL;DR: Density-based inputs outperform atom-based ones in low-data regimes for binding affinity prediction and quantum property modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atom-based representations may miss subtle physical information; electron density maps offer a continuous, physically grounded alternative.

Method: Compare three voxel-based input types (atom types, raw electron density, density gradient magnitude) for 3D CNNs on PDBbind and QM9 tasks.

Result: Density-based inputs excel in low-data regimes for binding affinity and outperform atom-based inputs in quantum property prediction.

Conclusion: Density-derived inputs enhance data efficiency and accuracy, highlighting their task- and regime-dependent strengths.

Abstract: Machine learning models for 3D molecular property prediction typically rely on atom-based representations, which may overlook subtle physical information. Electron density maps -- the direct output of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy -- offer a continuous, physically grounded alternative. We compare three voxel-based input types for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs): atom types, raw electron density, and density gradient magnitude, across two molecular tasks -- protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PDBbind) and quantum property prediction (QM9). We focus on voxel-based CNNs because electron density is inherently volumetric, and voxel grids provide the most natural representation for both experimental and computed densities. On PDBbind, all representations perform similarly with full data, but in low-data regimes, density-based inputs outperform atom types, while a shape-based baseline performs comparably -- suggesting that spatial occupancy dominates this task. On QM9, where labels are derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT) but input densities from a lower-level method (XTB), density-based inputs still outperform atom-based ones at scale, reflecting the rich structural and electronic information encoded in density. Overall, these results highlight the task- and regime-dependent strengths of density-derived inputs, improving data efficiency in affinity prediction and accuracy in quantum property modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal ML framework combining facial and GSR data predicts human trust in AI recommendations for ADHD mHealth, showing improved accuracy with multimodal cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human trust in AI is vital for safe AI integration in healthcare, especially mental health.

Method: Used facial video (OpenCV, transformer model) and GSR signals (tonic/phasic components) for trust prediction in two temporal windows (Early and Proximal Detection).

Result: Multimodal stacking achieved high accuracy (0.83 Early, 0.75 Proximal) and F1-scores (0.88 Early, 0.82 Proximal), proving bio signals as real-time trust markers.

Conclusion: Bio signals enhance trust prediction, enabling adaptive AI systems to maintain calibrated trust in mental health applications.

Abstract: Predicting human trust in AI systems is crucial for safe integration of AI-based decision support tools, especially in healthcare. This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window. These results demonstrate the potential of bio signals as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust their responses to maintain calibrated trust which is a critical capability in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how backdoor data affects neural network training, revealing unique mutual information signatures and a trade-off between visual and information-theoretic stealthiness of attacks. A new dynamics-based stealthiness metric is proposed and validated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of backdoor data on neural network training dynamics is crucial for improving defenses against such attacks.

Method: The study uses the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle and clustering of internal representations to analyze mutual information signatures of backdoor attacks across training phases.

Result: Findings show distinct mutual information behaviors for backdoor attacks, revealing unexpected stealthiness trade-offs. A novel stealthiness metric is introduced and tested.

Conclusion: The paper provides new insights into backdoor attack dynamics and offers a practical metric for evaluating their stealthiness.

Abstract: Understanding how backdoor data influences neural network training dynamics remains a complex and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the impact of backdoor data on the learning process, with a particular focus on the distinct behaviors between the target class and other clean classes. Leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle connected with clustering of internal representation, We find that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information (MI) signatures, which evolve across training phases and differ based on the attack mechanism. Our analysis uncovers a surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from an information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly into the model than many visually imperceptible attacks. Building on these insights, we propose a novel, dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies an attack's integration at the model level. We validate our findings and the proposed metric across multiple datasets and diverse attack types, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProPS integrates numerical and linguistic reasoning in RL, using LLMs for policy updates, outperforming traditional methods in tasks where semantic knowledge aids learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL relies on scalar rewards, missing rich semantic knowledge. Humans learn by combining feedback with language and prior knowledge, inspiring ProPS.

Method: ProPS uses LLMs in the policy optimization loop to propose updates based on rewards and language input, enabling numerical optimization and semantic reasoning.

Result: ProPS outperforms seven RL baselines in 8/15 tasks, showing significant gains with domain-specific knowledge.

Conclusion: ProPS demonstrates the potential of combining semantics and numerics for transparent, efficient, and human-aligned RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally relies on scalar reward signals, limiting its ability to leverage the rich semantic knowledge often available in real-world tasks. In contrast, humans learn efficiently by combining numerical feedback with language, prior knowledge, and common sense. We introduce Prompted Policy Search (ProPS), a novel RL method that unifies numerical and linguistic reasoning within a single framework. Unlike prior work that augment existing RL components with language, ProPS places a large language model (LLM) at the center of the policy optimization loop-directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input. We show that LLMs can perform numerical optimization in-context, and that incorporating semantic signals, such as goals, domain knowledge, and strategy hints can lead to more informed exploration and sample-efficient learning. ProPS is evaluated across fifteen Gymnasium tasks, spanning classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo environments, and compared to seven widely-adopted RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC, TRPO). It outperforms all baselines on eight out of fifteen tasks and demonstrates substantial gains when provided with domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of unifying semantics and numerics for transparent, generalizable, and human-aligned RL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether models truly reflect the underlying data structure, moving beyond traditional interpretability methods.

Method: Uses Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework to quantify feature effects in binary classification and compares them to model explanations.

Result: Provides a model-agnostic method for practitioners to evaluate model--data alignment interpretably.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical tool to ensure models align with data, enhancing interpretability and trust.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple and computationally efficient framework to evaluate whether machine learning models align with the structure of the data they learn from; that is, whether \textit{the model says what the data says}. Unlike existing interpretability methods that focus exclusively on explaining model behavior, our approach establishes a baseline derived directly from the data itself. Drawing inspiration from Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework, we quantify how strongly each feature separates the two outcome groups in a binary classification task, moving beyond traditional descriptive statistics to estimate each feature's effect on the outcome. By comparing these data-derived feature rankings against model-based explanations, we provide practitioners with an interpretable and model-agnostic method to assess model--data alignment.

*Tao Zhe,Huazhen Fang,Kunpeng Liu,Qian Lou,Tamzidul Hoque,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework for automated feature transformation, addressing limitations of dynamic feature expansion and insufficient agent cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automated feature transformation methods rely on heuristics or exhaustive searches, which are inefficient. RL-based approaches suffer from instability due to dynamic feature expansion and poor agent cooperation.

Method: Introduces a heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework with three agents grouped into two types, a shared critic mechanism for communication, multi-head attention-based feature agents, and state encoding to stabilize learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves automated feature transformation by enhancing agent cooperation and addressing dynamic feature expansion, leading to better performance.

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances downstream task performance by generating informative features through mathematical feature crossing. Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of human defection on AI-driven collusion in pricing ecosystems.

Method: Analyzed a stylized model where AI agents play equilibrium strategies while humans defect to no-regret strategies.

Result: Single human defection destabilizes collusion, and multiple defections push prices closer to competitive levels.

Conclusion: Algorithmic collusion is fragile in mixed human-AI ecosystems, especially under human defection.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed in ecosystems where they repeatedly interact not only with each other but also with humans. In this work, we study these human-AI ecosystems from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the classical framework of repeated pricing games. In our stylized model, the AI agents play equilibrium strategies, and one or more humans manually perform the pricing task instead of adopting an AI agent, thereby defecting to a no-regret strategy. Motivated by how populations of AI agents can sustain supracompetitive prices, we investigate whether high prices persist under such defections. Our main finding is that even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices, and multiple defections push prices even closer to competitive levels. We further show how the nature of collusion changes under defection-aware AI agents. Taken together, our results characterize when algorithmic collusion is fragile--and when it persists--in mixed ecosystems of AI agents and humans.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals for reliable C-VEP decoding in BCIs.

Method: Evaluated deep learning models (CNNs, Siamese networks) alongside CCA baselines on EEG data from 13 healthy adults, using distance-based decoding and temporal data augmentation.

Result: Deep models outperformed traditional methods; Siamese networks achieved 96.89% accuracy, showing robustness to latency variations.

Conclusion: Data-driven deep architectures, especially Siamese networks, are promising for reliable single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive BCIs.

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (C-VEPs) require highly robust decoding methods to address temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals. This study proposes and evaluates several deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 63-bit m-sequence reconstruction and classification, and Siamese networks for similarity-based decoding, alongside canonical correlation analysis (CCA) baselines. EEG data were recorded from 13 healthy adults under single-target flicker stimulation. The proposed deep models significantly outperformed traditional approaches, with distance-based decoding using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD showing greater robustness to latency variations than Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics. Temporal data augmentation with small shifts further improved generalization across sessions. Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.

*Krishna Khadka,Sunny Shree,Pujan Budhathoki,Yu Lei,Raghu Kacker,D. Richard Kuhn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABLE is a novel method using adversarial pairs to improve stability and fidelity in local explanations of machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models lack transparency, and existing local explanation methods like LIME suffer from instability and poor local fidelity.

Method: ABLE generates adversarial pairs around a test instance to approximate the decision boundary, then trains a linear model on these.

Result: Experiments on six datasets and three architectures show ABLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in stability and fidelity.

Conclusion: ABLE effectively addresses instability and fidelity issues in local explanations, offering a robust alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in critical applications but are mostly "black boxes" due to their lack of transparency. Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models. However, these approaches often suffer from instability and poor local fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary. Experimental results on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves higher stability and fidelity than the state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing CTR prediction is crucial for advertising systems, impacting relevance and engagement. The study aims to model user intent more effectively by leveraging large-scale behavioral data.

Method: The approach starts with supervised models (logistic regression, Light-GBM) on static features, then incorporates behavioral sequences using deep learning (MLPs, Transformers) to capture temporal dynamics.

Result: Transformers outperform baselines, improving AUC by 2.81%, especially for users with diverse or changing interests.

Conclusion: The research advances CTR prediction and suggests broader applications, like health information targeting, beyond e-commerce.

Abstract: Click-through rates prediction is critical in modern advertising systems, where ranking relevance and user engagement directly impact platform efficiency and business value. In this project, we explore how to model CTR more effectively using a large-scale Taobao dataset released by Alibaba. We start with supervised learning models, including logistic regression and Light-GBM, that are trained on static features such as user demographics, ad attributes, and contextual metadata. These models provide fast, interpretable benchmarks, but have limited capabilities to capture patterns of behavior that drive clicks. To better model user intent, we combined behavioral data from hundreds of millions of interactions over a 22-day period. By extracting and encoding user action sequences, we construct representations of user interests over time. We use deep learning models to fuse behavioral embeddings with static features. Among them, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have achieved significant performance improvements. To capture temporal dynamics, we designed a Transformer-based architecture that uses a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual dependencies across behavioral sequences, modeling not only what the user interacts with, but also the timing and frequency of interactions. Transformer improves AUC by 2.81 % over the baseline (LR model), with the largest gains observed for users whose interests are diverse or change over time. In addition to modeling, we propose an A/B testing strategy for real-world evaluation. We also think about the broader implications: personalized ad targeting technology can be applied to public health scenarios to achieve precise delivery of health information or behavior guidance. Our research provides a roadmap for advancing click-through rate predictions and extending their value beyond e-commerce.

Conclusion: The study advances AI-assisted specs-to-GDS automation for RFICs and provides actionable tools for designers.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on developing multi-template machine learning (ML) surrogate models and applying them to the inverse design of transformers (XFMRs) in radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). Our study starts with benchmarking four widely used ML architectures, including MLP-, CNN-, UNet-, and GT-based models, using the same datasets across different XFMR topologies. To improve modeling accuracy beyond these baselines, we then propose a new frequency-domain self-transfer learning technique that exploits correlations between adjacent frequency bands, leading to around 30%-50% accuracy improvement in the S-parameters prediction. Building on these models, we further develop an inverse design framework based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. This framework is validated using multiple impedance-matching tasks, all demonstrating fast convergence and trustworthy performance. These results advance the goal of AI-assisted specs-to-GDS automation for RFICs and provide RFIC designers with actionable tools for integrating AI into their workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emergent safety and security risks in agentic AI systems, which traditional isolated models cannot capture, and to unify these concerns with novel agentic-specific risks.

Method: Develops an operational taxonomy for agentic risks, uses auxiliary AI models with human oversight for contextual risk management, and employs AI-driven red teaming for risk discovery.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness through a case study of NVIDIA's AI-Q Research Assistant, identifying and mitigating novel agentic risks, and releases a dataset of 10,000 attack-defense traces.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates traditional and agentic risks, providing practical solutions for enterprise deployments, and contributes a dataset for future research.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic and actionable framework for securing agentic AI systems in enterprise deployment. We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of learning hypergraphs efficiently, focusing on orderly hypertrees due to their natural structure and subquadratic query complexity.

Method: Develops provably optimal algorithms using shortest-path queries and extends the approach to bounded distance queries for degraded measurements.

Result: Achieves optimal query complexity for orderly hypertrees and demonstrates tight bounds for general hypertrees under bounded distance queries.

Conclusion: The work provides efficient learning methods for hypergraphs, offering theoretical guarantees and practical applicability.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning hypergraphs with shortest-path queries (SP-queries), and present the first provably optimal online algorithm for a broad and natural class of hypertrees that we call orderly hypertrees. Our online algorithm can be transformed into a provably optimal offline algorithm. Orderly hypertrees can be positioned within the Fagin hierarchy of acyclic hypergraph (well-studied in database theory), and strictly encompass the broadest class in this hierarchy that is learnable with subquadratic SP-query complexity.
  Recognizing that in some contexts, such as evolutionary tree reconstruction, distance measurements can degrade with increased distance, we also consider a learning model that uses bounded distance queries. In this model, we demonstrate asymptotically tight complexity bounds for learning general hypertrees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of infinitesimal perturbations in EP and provide a more robust foundation for local credit assignment.

Method: Model network states as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions, prove gradients relate to Helmholtz free energy differences, and derive a generalized EP algorithm using loss-energy covariances.

Result: Demonstrates exact gradient estimation without infinitesimal approximations or convexity, enabling learning with strong error signals.

Conclusion: Finite-nudge EP provides a flexible and exact framework for credit assignment, expanding the applicability of EP.

Abstract: We liberate Equilibrium Propagation (EP) from the limit of infinitesimal perturbations by establishing a finite-nudge foundation for local credit assignment. By modeling network states as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions rather than deterministic points, we prove that the gradient of the difference in Helmholtz free energy between a nudged and free phase is exactly the difference in expected local energy derivatives. This validates the classic Contrastive Hebbian Learning update as an exact gradient estimator for arbitrary finite nudging, requiring neither infinitesimal approximations nor convexity. Furthermore, we derive a generalized EP algorithm based on the path integral of loss-energy covariances, enabling learning with strong error signals that standard infinitesimal approximations cannot support.

However, the inherent variability of EEG signals due to psychological and physical factors necessitates a cumbersome calibration process. In particular, the inter-subject variability of EEG signals leads to a domain shift problem, which makes it challenging to generalize drowsiness detection models to unseen target subjects. To address these issues, we propose a novel driver drowsiness detection framework that leverages online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to dynamically adjust to target subject distributions. Our proposed method updates the learnable parameters in batch normalization (BN) layers, while preserving pretrained normalization statistics, resulting in a modified configuration that ensures effective adaptation during test time. We incorporate a memory bank that dynamically manages streaming EEG segments, selecting samples based on their reliability determined by negative energy scores and persistence time. In addition, we introduce prototype learning to ensure robust predictions against distribution shifts over time. We validated our method on the sustained-attention driving dataset collected in a simulated environment, where drowsiness was estimated from delayed reaction times during monotonous lane-keeping tasks. Our experiments show that our method outperforms all baselines, achieving an average F1-score of 81.73\%, an improvement of 11.73\% over the best TTA baseline. This demonstrates that our proposed method significantly enhances the adaptability of EEG-based drowsiness detection systems in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

*Yejia Liu,Zhifeng Wu,Pengfei Li,Shaolei Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HealthPredictor is an AI model linking electricity use to public health outcomes, reducing prediction errors and enabling health-informed energy management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fossil fuels in the power sector still harm public health despite regulations, necessitating advanced demand-side approaches.

Method: HealthPredictor integrates three components: fuel mix predictor, air quality converter, and health impact assessor, tested across US regions.

Result: The health-driven optimization framework outperforms fuel mix-driven baselines, demonstrated through electric vehicle charging case studies.

Conclusion: AI models like HealthPredictor can advance public health by enabling health-informed energy management.

Abstract: The electric power sector is a leading source of air pollutant emissions, impacting the public health of nearly every community. Although regulatory measures have reduced air pollutants, fossil fuels remain a significant component of the energy supply, highlighting the need for more advanced demand-side approaches to reduce the public health impacts. To enable health-informed demand-side management, we introduce HealthPredictor, a domain-specific AI model that provides an end-to-end pipeline linking electricity use to public health outcomes. The model comprises three components: a fuel mix predictor that estimates the contribution of different generation sources, an air quality converter that models pollutant emissions and atmospheric dispersion, and a health impact assessor that translates resulting pollutant changes into monetized health damages. Across multiple regions in the United States, our health-driven optimization framework yields substantially lower prediction errors in terms of public health impacts than fuel mix-driven baselines. A case study on electric vehicle charging schedules illustrates the public health gains enabled by our method and the actionable guidance it can offer for health-informed energy management. Overall, this work shows how AI models can be explicitly designed to enable health-informed energy management for advancing public health and broader societal well-being.

### [337] [Convergence Dynamics of Over-Parameterized Score Matching for a Single Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22069)
*Yiran Zhang,Weihang Xu,Mo Zhou,Maryam Fazel,Simon Shaolei Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gradient descent for over-parameterized models learning a single Gaussian distribution under score matching, showing global convergence in high-noise regimes but challenges in low-noise regimes, with specific initialization conditions ensuring convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen theoretical understanding of score matching optimization dynamics, especially in over-parameterized settings, which is empirically successful but theoretically underexplored.

Method: Uses a student model with n parameters trained on a single ground-truth Gaussian via population score matching, analyzing optimization dynamics under varying noise scales and initialization conditions.

Result: Proves global convergence for high-noise regimes, identifies stationary points in low-noise regimes, and shows convergence for exponentially small initializations. Reveals divergence risks without proper initialization.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into score matching optimization, highlighting the importance of initialization and noise scale, and sets groundwork for analyzing Gaussian mixtures.

Abstract: Score matching has become a central training objective in modern generative modeling, particularly in diffusion models, where it is used to learn high-dimensional data distributions through the estimation of score functions. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the optimization behavior of score matching, particularly in over-parameterized regimes, remains limited. In this work, we study gradient descent for training over-parameterized models to learn a single Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we use a student model with $n$ learnable parameters and train it on data generated from a single ground-truth Gaussian using the population score matching objective. We analyze the optimization dynamics under multiple regimes. When the noise scale is sufficiently large, we prove a global convergence result for gradient descent. In the low-noise regime, we identify the existence of a stationary point, highlighting the difficulty of proving global convergence in this case. Nevertheless, we show convergence under certain initialization conditions: when the parameters are initialized to be exponentially small, gradient descent ensures convergence of all parameters to the ground truth. We further prove that without the exponentially small initialization, the parameters may not converge to the ground truth. Finally, we consider the case where parameters are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution far from the ground truth. We prove that, with high probability, only one parameter converges while the others diverge, yet the loss still converges to zero with a $1/τ$ rate, where $τ$ is the number of iterations. We also establish a nearly matching lower bound on the convergence rate in this regime. This is the first work to establish global convergence guarantees for Gaussian mixtures with at least three components under the score matching framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperCast is a novel framework using hypergraphs to model higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies in EV charging demand forecasting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate EV charging demand forecasting is crucial for grid stability and market participation, but current methods fail to capture complex group-wise dynamics in urban charging networks.

Method: HyperCast uses multi-view hypergraphs (static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based similarities) and multi-timescale inputs, with hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and cross-attention mechanisms to fuse information.

Result: HyperCast outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four public datasets, showing the effectiveness of modeling collective charging behaviors.

Conclusion: HyperCast demonstrates superior forecasting accuracy by explicitly capturing higher-order dependencies in EV charging networks.

Abstract: Accurate electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting is essential for stable grid operation and proactive EV participation in electricity market. Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting.

### [339] [ARES: Anomaly Recognition Model For Edge Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22078)
*Simone Mungari,Albert Bifet,Giuseppe Manco,Bernhard Pfahringer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARES is an unsupervised framework for detecting edge anomalies in temporal graphs using GNNs and HST, validated in cyber-attack scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time anomaly detection in temporal graphs is challenging due to concept drifts and large data volumes, requiring efficient solutions.

Method: Combines GNNs for feature extraction and HST for anomaly scoring, with an optional supervised thresholding mechanism.

Result: Validated in real-world cyber-attack scenarios, showing adaptability and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ARES effectively addresses the challenges of real-time anomaly detection in edge streams with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios involving streaming information can be represented as temporal graphs, where data flows through dynamic changes in edges over time. Anomaly detection in this context has the objective of identifying unusual temporal connections within the graph structure. Detecting edge anomalies in real time is crucial for mitigating potential risks. Unlike traditional anomaly detection, this task is particularly challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and the need for real-time response. To face these challenges, we introduce ARES, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for edge streams. ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees (HST) for anomaly scoring. GNNs capture both spike and burst anomalous behaviors within streams by embedding node and edge properties in a latent space, while HST partitions this space to isolate anomalies efficiently. ARES operates in an unsupervised way without the need for prior data labeling. To further validate its detection capabilities, we additionally incorporate a simple yet effective supervised thresholding mechanism. This approach leverages statistical dispersion among anomaly scores to determine the optimal threshold using a minimal set of labeled data, ensuring adaptability across different domains. We validate ARES through extensive evaluations across several real-world cyber-attack scenarios, comparing its performance against existing methods while analyzing its space and time complexity.

### [340] [A Fast and Flat Federated Learning Method via Weighted Momentum and Sharpness-Aware Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22080)
*Tianle Li,Yongzhi Huang,Linshan Jiang,Chang Liu,Qipeng Xie,Wenfeng Du,Lu Wang,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedWMSAM addresses local-global curvature misalignment and momentum-echo oscillation in federated learning by integrating momentum-guided global perturbations and adaptive coupling of momentum with SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning requires fast convergence and generalization across non-IID data, but combining momentum and SAM introduces unresolved issues like curvature misalignment and late-stage instability.

Method: FedWMSAM uses server-aggregated momentum for global perturbation alignment (single-backprop SAM) and a cosine-similarity adaptive rule to couple momentum and SAM in a two-phase training schedule.

Result: Experiments show FedWMSAM's effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness, outperforming existing methods in non-IID FL settings.

Conclusion: FedWMSAM successfully resolves key optimization challenges in federated learning, validated by theoretical bounds and empirical results.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), models must \emph{converge quickly} under tight communication budgets while \emph{generalizing} across non-IID client distributions. These twin requirements have naturally led to two widely used techniques: client/server \emph{momentum} to accelerate progress, and \emph{sharpness-aware minimization} (SAM) to prefer flat solutions. However, simply combining momentum and SAM leaves two structural issues unresolved in non-IID FL. We identify and formalize two failure modes: \emph{local-global curvature misalignment} (local SAM directions need not reflect the global loss geometry) and \emph{momentum-echo oscillation} (late-stage instability caused by accumulated momentum). To our knowledge, these failure modes have not been jointly articulated and addressed in the FL literature. We propose \textbf{FedWMSAM} to address both failure modes. First, we construct a momentum-guided global perturbation from server-aggregated momentum to align clients' SAM directions with the global descent geometry, enabling a \emph{single-backprop} SAM approximation that preserves efficiency. Second, we couple momentum and SAM via a cosine-similarity adaptive rule, yielding an early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule. We provide a non-IID convergence bound that \emph{explicitly models the perturbation-induced variance} $σ_ρ^2=σ^2+(Lρ)^2$ and its dependence on $(S, K, R, N)$ on the theory side. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, and the results validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of our method, demonstrating its superiority in addressing the optimization challenges of Federated Learning.

### [341] [Quantum Bayesian Optimization for Quality Improvement in Fuselage Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22090)
*Jiayu Liu,Chong Liu,Trevor Rhone,Yinan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework using quantum algorithms to improve sample efficiency in aerospace fuselage assembly by reducing dimensional gaps compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from low sample efficiency limitations of classical Monte Carlo methods in manufacturing systems, contrasted with quantum algorithms' ability to achieve similar accuracy with fewer samples.

Method: The QBO framework uses a quantum oracle (based on FEA or surrogate models) for precise shape control, employing Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to optimize input selection.

Result: Experimental results show QBO achieves lower dimensional error and uncertainty than classical methods using the same simulation queries.

Conclusion: QBO significantly enhances sample efficiency and precision in aerospace fuselage assembly, outperforming classical approaches.

Abstract: Recent efforts in smart manufacturing have enhanced aerospace fuselage assembly processes, particularly by innovating shape adjustment techniques to minimize dimensional gaps between assembled sections. Existing approaches have shown promising results but face the issue of low sample efficiency from the manufacturing systems. It arises from the limitation of the classical Monte Carlo method when uncovering the mean response from a distribution. In contrast, recent work has shown that quantum algorithms can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with significantly fewer samples than the classical Monte Carlo method from distributions. Therefore, we can adopt the estimation of the quantum algorithm to obtain the estimation from real physical systems (distributions). Motivated by this advantage, we propose a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework for precise shape control during assembly to improve the sample efficiency in manufacturing practice. Specifically, this approach utilizes a quantum oracle, based on finite element analysis (FEA)-based models or surrogate models, to acquire a more accurate estimation of the environment response with fewer queries for a certain input. QBO employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to strategically select input values that are most likely to maximize the objective function. It has been theoretically proven to require much fewer samples while maintaining comparable optimization results. In the case study, force-controlled actuators are applied to one fuselage section to adjust its shape and reduce the gap to the adjoining section. Experimental results demonstrate that QBO achieves significantly lower dimensional error and uncertainty compared to classical methods, particularly using the same queries from the simulation.

*Daniel Agyei Asante,Md Mokarram Chowdhury,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of low-rank factorization compression on the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs), covering privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness, as existing research focuses on performance and system-level benefits but overlooks trustworthiness implications.

Method: Evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, analyzing trustworthiness across key dimensions.

Result: Low-rank compression preserves privacy but weakens PII protection, enhances adversarial robustness, degrades ethical reasoning in zero-shot settings, and reduces fairness. Model scale and fine-tuning also influence trustworthiness.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs in LLM compression and provides insights for designing trustworthy compression strategies, supported by gradient-based attribution analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances across domains, yet their massive size hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. Model compression addresses this challenge, with low-rank factorization emerging as a particularly effective method for reducing size, memory, and computation while maintaining accuracy. However, while these compressed models boast of benign performance and system-level advantages, their trustworthiness implications remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression. Beyond compression, we investigate how model scale and fine-tuning affect trustworthiness, as both are important in low-rank methods. To guide trustworthy compression strategies, we end our paper with a gradient-based attribution analysis to identify which layers in LLMs contribute most to adversarial robustness.

TL;DR: The paper addresses selecting a small, representative action subset from a large action space in RL, proving its algorithm's near-optimal performance under a relaxed sub-Gaussian model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in efficiently learning over large action spaces in RL applications like inventory management, where exhaustive evaluation is impractical.

Method: Extends prior meta-bandit results to MDPs, using an algorithm that identifies a fixed, near-optimal action subset for heterogeneous environments.

Result: The algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space, proven under a relaxed sub-Gaussian model.

Conclusion: The approach offers a computationally and sample-efficient solution for large-scale combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a small, representative action subset from an extremely large action space shared across a family of reinforcement learning (RL) environments -- a fundamental challenge in applications like inventory management and recommendation systems, where direct learning over the entire space is intractable. Our goal is to identify a fixed subset of actions that, for every environment in the family, contains a near-optimal action, thereby enabling efficient learning without exhaustively evaluating all actions.
  This work extends our prior results for meta-bandits to the more general setting of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that our existing algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. This theoretical guarantee is established under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model, which accommodates greater environmental heterogeneity. Consequently, our approach provides a computationally and sample-efficient solution for large-scale combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes continuous learning approaches for Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) using Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Banditron and AGREL) to address non-stationarity in implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs), demonstrating efficiency in resource usage and stability in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable and resource-efficient neural decoders in wireless iBMIs due to system non-stationarity and energy constraints drives this research.

Method: Continuous learning approaches with RL algorithms (Banditron and AGREL) adapted for DSNNs are proposed and tested in open-loop and closed-loop experiments.

Result: DSNN Banditron and AGREL show stable accuracy over time, with Banditron significantly reducing memory access and computational requirements compared to AGREL and previous SNN decoders.

Conclusion: DSNN Banditron is highly efficient and suitable for future wireless iBMI systems due to its low computational demands and stable performance.

Abstract: The number of simultaneously recorded neurons follows an exponentially increasing trend in implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). Integrating the neural decoder in the implant is an effective data compression method for future wireless iBMIs. However, the non-stationarity of the system makes the performance of the decoder unreliable. To avoid frequent retraining of the decoder and to ensure the safety and comfort of the iBMI user, continuous learning is essential for real-life applications. Since Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) are being recognized as a promising approach for developing resource-efficient neural decoder, we propose continuous learning approaches with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms adapted for DSNNs. Banditron and AGREL are chosen as the two candidate RL algorithms since they can be trained with limited computational resources, effectively addressing the non-stationary problem and fitting the energy constraints of implantable devices. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted both open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The accuracy of open-loop experiments conducted with DSNN Banditron and DSNN AGREL remains stable over extended periods. Meanwhile, the time-to-target in the closed-loop experiment with perturbations, DSNN Banditron performed comparably to that of DSNN AGREL while achieving reductions of 98% in memory access usage and 99% in the requirements for multiply- and-accumulate (MAC) operations during training. Compared to previous continuous learning SNN decoders, DSNN Banditron requires 98% less computes making it a prime candidate for future wireless iBMI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) as a surrogate model for steady-state solar wind modeling, offering efficient forecasting and outperforming existing methods like HUX.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate solar wind modeling is crucial for space weather forecasting due to its impact on satellites and infrastructure, but traditional 3D MHD models are computationally expensive.

Method: The authors develop SFNO, a surrogate model, and compare its performance to HUX, an existing numerical surrogate, across multiple metrics.

Result: SFNO achieves comparable or better performance than HUX, though HUX excels in physical smoothness.

Conclusion: SFNO is a flexible, trainable solution for real-time forecasting and can improve with additional data, highlighting the need for refined evaluation criteria.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Variations such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communications, making accurate modeling essential for space weather forecasting. While 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are used to simulate and investigate these variations in the solar wind, they tend to be computationally expensive, limiting their usefulness in investigating the impacts of boundary condition uncertainty. In this work, we develop a surrogate for steady state solar wind modeling, using a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). We compare our model to a previously developed numerical surrogate for this task called HUX, and we show that the SFNO achieves comparable or better performance across several metrics. Though HUX retains advantages in physical smoothness, this underscores the need for improved evaluation criteria rather than a flaw in SFNO. As a flexible and trainable approach, SFNO enables efficient real-time forecasting and can improve with more data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling missing data in heterogeneous datasets (both numerical and categorical) is challenging, as existing methods often fail to capture structural dependencies and handle heterogeneity effectively.

Method: IVGAE constructs a bipartite graph for sample-feature relationships, uses graph representation learning, and features a dual-decoder architecture (one for feature embeddings and one for missingness patterns). It also employs a Transformer-based heterogeneous embedding module for categorical variables.

Result: Experiments on 16 real-world datasets show IVGAE consistently improves RMSE and downstream F1 scores across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR scenarios with up to 30% missing rates.

Conclusion: IVGAE provides a robust solution for imputing missing data in heterogeneous datasets, outperforming existing methods by leveraging graph learning and dual-decoder architecture.

Abstract: Handling missing data remains a fundamental challenge in real-world tabular datasets, especially when data are heterogeneous with both numerical and categorical features. Existing imputation methods often fail to capture complex structural dependencies and handle heterogeneous data effectively. We present \textbf{IVGAE}, a Variational Graph Autoencoder framework for robust imputation of incomplete heterogeneous data. IVGAE constructs a bipartite graph to represent sample-feature relationships and applies graph representation learning to model structural dependencies. A key innovation is its \textit{dual-decoder architecture}, where one decoder reconstructs feature embeddings and the other models missingness patterns, providing structural priors aware of missing mechanisms. To better encode categorical variables, we introduce a Transformer-based heterogeneous embedding module that avoids high-dimensional one-hot encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 real-world datasets show that IVGAE achieves consistent improvements in RMSE and downstream F1 across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missing scenarios under 30\% missing rates.

*John J. Vastola,Samuel J. Gershman,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a variational framework for dimensionality reduction, offering nonlinear embeddings, better interpretability, and retaining PCA as a special case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dimensionality reduction methods like PCA lack flexibility for nonlinear data, while flexible methods (e.g., autoencoders) suffer from interpretability or geometric distortion issues.

Method: The authors introduce a variational framework framing dimensionality reduction as an optimal manifold embedding problem, enabling nonlinear solutions and analytical characterization.

Result: The framework supports nonlinear embeddings, satisfies interpretable PDEs, and recovers PCA as a special case.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses limitations of existing methods, balancing flexibility and interpretability while encompassing PCA.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction algorithms like principal component analysis (PCA) are workhorses of machine learning and neuroscience, but each has well-known limitations. Variants of PCA are simple and interpretable, but not flexible enough to capture nonlinear data manifold structure. More flexible approaches have other problems: autoencoders are generally difficult to interpret, and graph-embedding-based methods can produce pathological distortions in manifold geometry. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose a variational framework that casts dimensionality reduction algorithms as solutions to an optimal manifold embedding problem. By construction, this framework permits nonlinear embeddings, allowing its solutions to be more flexible than PCA. Moreover, the variational nature of the framework has useful consequences for interpretability: each solution satisfies a set of partial differential equations, and can be shown to reflect symmetries of the embedding objective. We discuss these features in detail and show that solutions can be analytically characterized in some cases. Interestingly, one special case exactly recovers PCA.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the need for adaptive experiential learning in agents, introduces BELA benchmark for evaluation, and shows current models' limitations in improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents must adapt to incomplete knowledge and shifting environments, but current evaluations lack emphasis on experiential learning.

Method: Developed BELA benchmark with real-world Amazon products, diverse user personas, and LLM-powered user simulator.

Result: Frontier models struggle to improve meaningfully across episodes, indicating weak in-context learning capabilities.

Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity for agentic systems with robust in-context learning to navigate dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: To reliably navigate ever-shifting real-world environments, agents must grapple with incomplete knowledge and adapt their behavior through experience. However, current evaluations largely focus on tasks that leave no ambiguity, and do not measure agents' ability to adaptively learn and reason through the experiences they accrued. We exemplify the need for this in-context experiential learning in a product recommendation context, where agents must navigate shifting customer preferences and product landscapes through natural language dialogue. We curate a benchmark for experiential learning and active exploration (BELA) that combines (1) rich real-world products from Amazon, (2) a diverse collection of user personas to represent heterogeneous yet latent preferences, and (3) a LLM user simulator powered by the persona to create rich interactive trajectories. We observe that current frontier models struggle to meaningfully improve across episodes, underscoring the need for agentic systems with strong in-context learning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting responses in dynamical systems with model-form errors (MFEs) and ensure trustworthy uncertainty propagation from diagnosis to prediction.

Method: Integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) for joint estimation of MFEs and system states, and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for probabilistic nonlinear mapping capturing diagnostic uncertainty.

Result: Demonstrated predictive accuracy and robustness across four nonlinear examples, including a single DOF oscillator, multi-DOF system, Bouc-Wen hysteretic system, and Silverbox experimental dataset.

Conclusion: The framework successfully propagates uncertainty systematically, making it reliable for digital twin applications in dynamical systems with misspecified physics.

Abstract: This work presents a probabilistic digital twin framework for response prediction in dynamical systems governed by misspecified physics. The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins. The framework is demonstrated using four nonlinear examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, and two established benchmarks -- the Bouc-Wen hysteretic system and the Silverbox experimental dataset -- highlighting its predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving, low-latency autonomous agents on edge devices without cloud reliance.

Method: Evaluated SLMs using BFCL, employing SFT, PEFT, RL, DPO, and hybrid optimization.

Result: Medium-sized models (1-3B) outperformed ultra-compact models (<1B), achieving up to 65.74% accuracy.

Conclusion: Hybrid optimization enhances SLMs for accurate, efficient, and stable agentic AI on edge devices.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of small language models (SLMs) for agentic tasks (function/tool/API calling) with a focus on running agents on edge devices without reliance on cloud infrastructure. We evaluate SLMs using the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) framework and describe parameter-driven optimization strategies that include supervised fine-tuning (SFT), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and hybrid methods. We report results for models including TinyAgent, TinyLlama, Qwen, and xLAM across BFCL categories (simple, multiple, parallel, parallel-multiple, and relevance detection), both in live and non-live settings, and in multi-turn evaluations. We additionally detail a DPO training pipeline constructed from AgentBank data (e.g., ALFRED), including our conversion of SFT data to chosen-rejected pairs using TinyLlama responses as rejected outputs and manual validation. Our results demonstrate clear accuracy differences across model scales where medium-sized models (1-3B parameters) significantly outperform ultra-compact models (<1B parameters), achieving up to 65.74% overall accuracy, and 55.62% multi-turn accuracy with hybrid optimization. This study highlights the importance of hybrid optimization strategies that enable small language models to deliver accurate, efficient, and stable agentic AI on edge devices, making privacy-preserving, low-latency autonomous agents practical beyond the cloud.

*Florian Rottach,William Rudman,Bastain Rieck,Harrisen Scells,Carsten Eickhoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a framework for analyzing text embeddings, showing redundancy in existing metrics and UTS's ability to predict model properties and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing interpretability and understanding factors affecting downstream task performance in text embedding models.

Method: Analysis of topological and geometric measures across models and datasets, leading to the development of UTS.

Result: UTS predicts model-specific properties, reveals architectural similarities, and links topology to ranking effectiveness.

Conclusion: A multi-attribute approach like UTS is crucial for leveraging text embedding geometry.

Abstract: Studying how embeddings are organized in space not only enhances model interpretability but also uncovers factors that drive downstream task performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets. We find a high degree of redundancy among these measures and observe that individual metrics often fail to sufficiently differentiate embedding spaces. Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces. We show that UTS can predict model-specific properties and reveal similarities driven by model architecture. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our method by linking topological structure to ranking effectiveness and accurately predicting document retrievability. We find that a holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential to understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings.

### [353] [Designing Instance-Level Sampling Schedules via REINFORCE with James-Stein Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22177)
*Peiyu Yu,Suraj Kothawade,Sirui Xie,Ying Nian Wu,Hongliang Fei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to improve text-to-image samplers by rescheduling sampling timelines using instance-level schedules learned via a Dirichlet policy, outperforming traditional weight-focused approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training methods primarily focus on adjusting model weights (fine-tuning or distillation). This work explores an alternative by optimizing the sampling timeline of frozen samplers.

Method: The authors propose learning prompt- and noise-conditioned sampling schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. They introduce a novel James-Stein estimator-based reward baseline for accurate gradient estimation.

Result: The rescheduled samplers improve text-image alignment (e.g., text rendering, compositional control) across Stable Diffusion and Flux models. A 5-step Flux-Dev sampler matches distilled samplers' quality.

Conclusion: The scheduling framework is presented as a model-agnostic post-training lever to enhance pretrained samplers' generative potential without modifying weights.

Abstract: Most post-training methods for text-to-image samplers focus on model weights: either fine-tuning the backbone for alignment or distilling it for few-step efficiency. We take a different route: rescheduling the sampling timeline of a frozen sampler. Instead of a fixed, global schedule, we learn instance-level (prompt- and noise-conditioned) schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. To ensure accurate gradient estimates in high-dimensional policy learning, we introduce a novel reward baseline based on a principled James-Stein estimator; it provably achieves lower estimation errors than commonly used variants and leads to superior performance. Our rescheduled samplers consistently improve text-image alignment including text rendering and compositional control across modern Stable Diffusion and Flux model families. Additionally, a 5-step Flux-Dev sampler with our schedules can attain generation quality comparable to deliberately distilled samplers like Flux-Schnell. We thus position our scheduling framework as an emerging model-agnostic post-training lever that unlocks additional generative potential in pretrained samplers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU data is complex and fragmented, making clinical prediction challenging. PULSE-ICU aims to address this by learning event-level representations without manual feature engineering.

Method: The model uses a unified embedding module for encoding various data attributes and a Longformer-based encoder for efficient trajectory modeling.

Result: PULSE-ICU outperformed benchmarks across 18 prediction tasks and showed robustness in external validation.

Conclusion: Foundation-style modeling like PULSE-ICU enhances data efficiency and adaptability, offering scalable ICU decision support.

Abstract: Intensive care unit (ICU) data are highly irregular, heterogeneous, and temporally fragmented, posing challenges for generalizable clinical prediction. We present PULSE-ICU, a self-supervised foundation model that learns event-level ICU representations from large-scale EHR sequences without resampling or manual feature engineering. A unified embedding module encodes event identity, continuous values, units, and temporal attributes, while a Longformer-based encoder enables efficient modeling of long trajectories. PULSE-ICU was fine-tuned across 18 prediction tasks, including mortality, intervention forecasting, and phenotype identification, achieving strong performance across task types. External validation on eICU, HiRID, and P12 showed substantial improvements with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness to domain shift and variable constraints. These findings suggest that foundation-style modeling can improve data efficiency and adaptability, providing a scalable framework for ICU decision support across diverse clinical environments.

*Junsung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiCQL-ML is a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes reward and Q-functions in a bi-level framework, improving reward recovery and policy performance without online interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline IRL aims to recover reward functions from fixed demonstration data without online interaction, but existing methods may struggle with over-generalization or require explicit policy learning.

Method: BiCQL-ML alternates between learning a conservative Q-function via CQL and updating reward parameters to maximize expert Q-values while suppressing out-of-distribution actions.

Result: The method converges to a reward function where the expert policy is soft-optimal and outperforms baselines in reward recovery and downstream policy performance.

Conclusion: BiCQL-ML offers a robust approach for offline IRL with theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Offline inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function that explains expert behavior using only fixed demonstration data, without any additional online interaction. We propose BiCQL-ML, a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes a reward function and a conservative Q-function in a bi-level framework, thereby avoiding explicit policy learning. The method alternates between (i) learning a conservative Q-function via Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) under the current reward, and (ii) updating the reward parameters to maximize the expected Q-values of expert actions while suppressing over-generalization to out-of-distribution actions. This procedure can be viewed as maximum likelihood estimation under a soft value matching principle. We provide theoretical guarantees that BiCQL-ML converges to a reward function under which the expert policy is soft-optimal. Empirically, we show on standard offline RL benchmarks that BiCQL-ML improves both reward recovery and downstream policy performance compared to existing offline IRL baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRE is a model-heterogeneous federated learning framework using entangled representations to balance performance, privacy, and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods assume homogeneous models, which is impractical due to client heterogeneity in data and resources.

Method: FedRE aggregates local representations into entangled representations using normalized random weights and integrates one-hot labels similarly, training a global classifier on the server.

Result: FedRE achieves a balance between model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead.

Conclusion: FedRE effectively addresses client heterogeneity in FL with entangled representations, improving privacy and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across clients without compromising privacy. While most existing FL methods assume homogeneous model architectures, client heterogeneity in data and resources renders this assumption impractical, motivating model-heterogeneous FL. To address this problem, we propose Federated Representation Entanglement (FedRE), a framework built upon a novel form of client knowledge termed entangled representation. In FedRE, each client aggregates its local representations into a single entangled representation using normalized random weights and applies the same weights to integrate the corresponding one-hot label encodings into the entangled-label encoding. Those are then uploaded to the server to train a global classifier. During training, each entangled representation is supervised across categories via its entangled-label encoding, while random weights are resampled each round to introduce diversity, mitigating the global classifier's overconfidence and promoting smoother decision boundaries. Furthermore, each client uploads a single cross-category entangled representation along with its entangled-label encoding, mitigating the risk of representation inversion attacks and reducing communication overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRE achieves an effective trade-off among model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead. The codes are available at https://github.com/AIResearch-Group/FedRE.

*Henrijs Princis,Arindam Sharma,Cristina David*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeCoder introduces a flexible framework for improving code generation in LLMs by treating decoding strategies and constraints as optimizable components, leading to better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs often generate syntactically or semantically incorrect code when guided by natural language prompts alone.

Method: TreeCoder represents decoding as a tree search with optimizable strategies and constraints (e.g., style, syntax, execution).

Result: TreeCoder improves accuracy on MBPP and SQL-Spider benchmarks, outperforming unconstrained baselines.

Conclusion: TreeCoder provides a systematic way to enforce correctness and structure in LLM-generated code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability to generate code, yet their outputs often violate syntactic or semantic constraints when guided only through natural language prompts. We introduce TreeCoder, the most general and flexible framework to date for exploring decoding strategies, constraints, and hyperparameters in LLMs, and use it in code generation to enforce correctness and structure during decoding rather than relying on prompt engineering. TreeCoder represents decoding as a tree search over candidate programs, where both decoding strategies and constraint functions - such as style, syntax, execution - are treated as first-class, optimisable components. This design enables systematic exploration and automatic tuning of decoding configurations using standard optimisation techniques. Experiments on the MBPP (Python) and SQL-Spider benchmarks show that TreeCoder consistently improves accuracy across open-source models such as CodeLlama, Mistral and DeepSeek, often outperforming their unconstrained baselines by considerable margins.

*Ofir Schlisselberg,Uri Sherman,Tomer Koren,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies inexact Online Mirror Descent (OMD), revealing the impact of regularizer smoothness on robustness to approximation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OMD analyses assume error-free settings, limiting practical understanding. The work aims to systematically analyze inexact OMD.

Method: The study explores the relationship between regularizer smoothness and error robustness, focusing on barrier regularizers over the simplex and subsets.

Result: Uniformly smooth regularizers show tight bounds on excess regret. Negative entropy requires exponentially small errors, while log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust with polynomial errors. Stochastic losses regain robustness for negative entropy on the simplex.

Conclusion: Robustness to inexactness varies by regularizer and domain, with negative entropy showing domain-dependent behavior.

Abstract: Online mirror descent (OMD) is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that underlies many algorithms in optimization, machine learning and sequential decision-making. The OMD iterates are defined as solutions to optimization subproblems which, oftentimes, can be solved only approximately, leading to an inexact version of the algorithm. Nonetheless, existing OMD analyses typically assume an idealized error free setting, thereby limiting our understanding of performance guarantees that should be expected in practice. In this work we initiate a systematic study into inexact OMD, and uncover an intricate relation between regularizer smoothness and robustness to approximation errors. When the regularizer is uniformly smooth, we establish a tight bound on the excess regret due to errors. Then, for barrier regularizers over the simplex and its subsets, we identify a sharp separation: negative entropy requires exponentially small errors to avoid linear regret, whereas log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust even when the errors are only polynomial. Finally, we show that when the losses are stochastic and the domain is the simplex, negative entropy regains robustness-but this property does not extend to all subsets, where exponentially small errors are again necessary to avoid suboptimal regret.

### [359] [Online Dynamic Pricing of Complementary Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22291)
*Marco Mussi,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic pricing algorithm for complementary products, optimizing revenue by considering demand interactions and using machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pricing models overlook interactions between products, missing opportunities for coordinated strategies to maximize revenue.

Method: An online learning algorithm identifies complementary relationships via integer programming and optimizes pricing using heteroscedastic Gaussian processes.

Result: Simulations show the algorithm outperforms others by leveraging product interdependencies, improving overall revenue.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic pricing approach effectively captures complementary product interactions, enhancing revenue potential.

Abstract: Traditional pricing paradigms, once dominated by static models and rule-based heuristics, are increasingly being replaced by dynamic, data-driven approaches powered by machine learning algorithms. Despite their growing sophistication, most dynamic pricing algorithms focus on optimizing the price of each product independently, disregarding potential interactions among items. By neglecting these interdependencies in consumer demand across related goods, sellers may fail to capture the full potential of coordinated pricing strategies. In this paper, we address this problem by exploring dynamic pricing mechanisms designed explicitly for complementary products, aiming to exploit their joint demand structure to maximize overall revenue. We present an online learning algorithm considering both positive and negative interactions between products' demands. The algorithm utilizes transaction data to identify advantageous complementary relationships through an integer programming problem between different items, and then optimizes pricing strategies using data-driven and computationally efficient multi-armed bandit solutions based on heteroscedastic Gaussian processes. We validate our solution in a simulated environment, and we demonstrate that our solution improves the revenue w.r.t. a comparable learning algorithm ignoring such interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tumor growth models like Gompertz and Bertalanffy lack adaptability to patient-specific variability, especially with limited data. This study aims to enhance predictive accuracy by leveraging SciML techniques.

Method: The study replaces rigid terms in the Gompertz model with adaptive neural networks using Neural ODEs and UDEs, implemented in Julia. It performs forecasting and symbolic recovery to derive explicit mathematical expressions.

Result: The adaptive models capture hidden tumor dynamics and improve forecasting accuracy under data constraints, enabling better treatment strategies.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for enhancing tumor growth prediction, supporting dynamic and effective clinical interventions.

Abstract: Forecasting tumor growth is critical for optimizing treatment. Classical growth models such as the Gompertz and Bertalanffy equations capture general tumor dynamics but may fail to adapt to patient-specific variability, particularly with limited data available. In this study, we leverage Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), two pillars of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), to construct adaptive tumor growth models capable of learning from experimental data. Using the Gompertz model as a baseline, we replace rigid terms with adaptive neural networks to capture hidden dynamics through robust modeling in the Julia programming language. We use our models to perform forecasting under data constraints and symbolic recovery to transform the learned dynamics into explicit mathematical expressions. Our approach has the potential to improve predictive accuracy, guiding dynamic and effective treatment strategies for improved clinical outcomes.

*Dario Fenoglio,Mohan Li,Pietro Barbiero,Nicholas D. Lane,Marc Langheinrich,Martin Gjoreski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLUX is a clustering-based federated learning framework addressing non-IID data challenges without needing prior knowledge of distribution shifts or cluster counts, improving accuracy by up to 23% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL struggles with non-IID data, reducing accuracy and limiting real-world applicability.

Method: FLUX uses privacy-preserving client-side descriptor extraction and unsupervised clustering to handle diverse distribution shifts.

Result: FLUX outperforms baselines by up to 23% accuracy while maintaining efficiency comparable to FedAvg.

Conclusion: FLUX effectively addresses non-IID challenges in FL, enhancing performance and scalability without prior knowledge.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy. Traditional FL methods often use a global model to fit all clients, assuming that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, when this assumption does not hold, the global model accuracy may drop significantly, limiting FL applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FLUX, a novel clustering-based FL (CFL) framework that addresses the four most common types of distribution shifts during both training and test time. To this end, FLUX leverages privacy-preserving client-side descriptor extraction and unsupervised clustering to ensure robust performance and scalability across varying levels and types of distribution shifts. Unlike existing CFL methods addressing non-IID client distribution shifts, FLUX i) does not require any prior knowledge of the types of distribution shifts or the number of client clusters, and ii) supports test-time adaptation, enabling unseen and unlabeled clients to benefit from the most suitable cluster-specific models. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks, two real-world datasets and ten state-of-the-art baselines show that FLUX improves performance and stability under diverse distribution shifts, achieving an average accuracy gain of up to 23 percentage points over the best-performing baselines, while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeXposure, a large-scale dataset for inter-protocol credit exposure in decentralized financial networks, and presents benchmarks for machine learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive dataset for studying inter-protocol credit exposure in decentralized financial networks, and to provide tools for financial risk monitoring and research.

Method: Curated a dataset (DeXposure) covering global markets, defined a new measure (value-linked credit exposure), and developed a token-to-protocol model. Three benchmarks were created: graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal graph neural networks.

Result: Observations include rapid network volume growth, concentration to key protocols, declining network density, and distinct shock propagation across sectors. The dataset and code are publicly released.

Conclusion: DeXposure aids research in machine learning and financial risk monitoring, offering benchmarks for graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal graph analysis.

Abstract: We curate the DeXposure dataset, the first large-scale dataset for inter-protocol credit exposure in decentralized financial networks, covering global markets of 43.7 million entries across 4.3 thousand protocols, 602 blockchains, and 24.3 thousand tokens, from 2020 to 2025. A new measure, value-linked credit exposure between protocols, is defined as the inferred financial dependency relationships derived from changes in Total Value Locked (TVL). We develop a token-to-protocol model using DefiLlama metadata to infer inter-protocol credit exposure from the token's stock dynamics, as reported by the protocols. Based on the curated dataset, we develop three benchmarks for machine learning research with financial applications: (1) graph clustering for global network measurement, tracking the structural evolution of credit exposure networks, (2) vector autoregression for sector-level credit exposure dynamics during major shocks (Terra and FTX), and (3) temporal graph neural networks for dynamic link prediction on temporal graphs. From the analysis, we observe (1) a rapid growth of network volume, (2) a trend of concentration to key protocols, (3) a decline of network density (the ratio of actual connections to possible connections), and (4) distinct shock propagation across sectors, such as lending platforms, trading exchanges, and asset management protocols. The DeXposure dataset and code have been released publicly. We envision they will help with research and practice in machine learning as well as financial risk monitoring, policy analysis, DeFi market modeling, amongst others. The dataset also contributes to machine learning research by offering benchmarks for graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal graph analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SingleQuant, a single-pass quantization framework, decouples quantization truncation to eliminate convergence issues, achieving faster quantization and better performance for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM quantization methods suffer from non-smoothness and gradient noise due to incompatible optimization and truncation, degrading performance and prolonging quantization time.

Method: SingleQuant introduces Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) using Givens rotations to smooth outliers and reshape distributions, eliminating gradient noise.

Result: SingleQuant outperforms baselines, offering a 1,400× speedup and +0.57% performance gain for LLaMA-2-13B quantization.

Conclusion: SingleQuant effectively addresses convergence issues in LLM quantization, delivering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) quantization facilitates deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings, but existing methods that combine incompatible gradient optimization and quantization truncation lead to serious convergence pathology. This prolongs quantization time and degrades LLMs' task performance. Our studies confirm that Straight-Through Estimator (STE) on Stiefel manifolds introduce non-smoothness and gradient noise, obstructing optimization convergence and blocking high-fidelity quantized LLM development despite extensive training. To tackle the above limitations, we propose SingleQuant, a single-pass quantization framework that decouples from quantization truncation, thereby eliminating the above non-smoothness and gradient noise factors. Specifically, SingleQuant constructs Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) targeting distinct activation outliers, where ART achieves smoothing of outlier values via closed-form optimal rotations, and URT reshapes distributions through geometric mapping. Both matrices comprise strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and rotation angles, enabling promising LLMs task performance within a short time. Experimental results demonstrate SingleQuant's superiority over the selected baselines across diverse tasks on 7B-70B LLMs. To be more precise, SingleQuant enables quantized LLMs to achieve higher task performance while necessitating less time for quantization. For example, when quantizing LLaMA-2-13B, SingleQuant achieves 1,400$\times$ quantization speedup and increases +0.57\% average task performance compared to the selected best baseline.

Method: PI-TTT performs lightweight self-supervised refinement of surrogate outputs through gradient-based updates, adapting locally to unseen conditions without labeled data.

Result: Experiments show PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared to purely ML-based models, maintaining computational speed.

Conclusion: PI-TTT offers fast, accurate, and physically reliable PF predictions, advancing scalable and physics-consistent learning in power systems.

Abstract: Power Flow (PF) calculation based on machine learning (ML) techniques offer significant computational advantages over traditional numerical methods but often struggle to maintain full physical consistency. This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.

*Denis Huseljic,Marek Herde,Lukas Rauch,Paul Hahn,Bernhard Sick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFINE is an ensemble active learning (AL) method that combines multiple AL strategies to outperform individual and existing ensemble methods by progressively filtering and ensuring coverage-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AL strategies vary in effectiveness across datasets, models, and AL cycles, risking suboptimal performance when committing to a single strategy.

Method: REFINE combines multiple AL strategies in two stages: progressive filtering to refine the unlabeled pool and coverage-based selection to choose the final batch.

Result: Extensive experiments show REFINE outperforms individual strategies and existing ensemble methods across 6 datasets and 3 foundation models.

Conclusion: REFINE is a flexible and effective ensemble AL method that improves performance and can incorporate new strategies.

Abstract: Existing active learning (AL) strategies capture fundamentally different notions of data value, e.g., uncertainty or representativeness. Consequently, the effectiveness of strategies can vary substantially across datasets, models, and even AL cycles. Committing to a single strategy risks suboptimal performance, as no single strategy dominates throughout the entire AL process. We introduce REFINE, an ensemble AL method that combines multiple strategies without knowing in advance which will perform best. In each AL cycle, REFINE operates in two stages: (1) Progressive filtering iteratively refines the unlabeled pool by considering an ensemble of AL strategies, retaining promising candidates capturing different notions of value. (2) Coverage-based selection then chooses a final batch from this refined pool, ensuring all previously identified notions of value are accounted for. Extensive experiments across 6 classification datasets and 3 foundation models show that REFINE consistently outperforms individual strategies and existing ensemble methods. Notably, progressive filtering serves as a powerful preprocessing step that improves the performance of any individual AL strategy applied to the refined pool, which we demonstrate on an audio spectrogram classification use case. Finally, the ensemble of REFINE can be easily extended with upcoming state-of-the-art AL strategies.

Result: Reduces code by 11-27x, profiling costs by 11x, improves accuracy by 15.6%, reduces latency by 60.03%.

Conclusion: AutoTailor offers efficient, automated solutions for adaptive model deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: On-device machine learning (ML) has become a fundamental component of emerging mobile applications. Adaptive model deployment delivers efficient inference for heterogeneous device capabilities and performance requirements through customizing neural architectures. SuperNet-based approaches offer a promising solution by generating a large number of model variants from a pre-trained ML model. However, applying SuperNet in existing frameworks suffers from tedious model-aware development and time-consuming hardware-aware profiling, which limits their practical adoption.
  We present AutoTailor, the first framework to enable automated, end-to-end SuperNet-based adaptive model deployment for edge devices. Unlike manual SuperNet construction, AutoTailor employs a computation graph-guided compilation approach to automatically transform user-provided ML models into SuperNets. To support efficient specialization, AutoTailor incorporates learning-free latency and accuracy predictors, enabling low-cost yet accurate performance prediction. Our extended evaluations demonstrate that AutoTailor reduces the lines of code for SuperNet construction by 11--27$\times$, decreases hardware-aware profiling costs by at least 11$\times$, and achieves up to 15.60\% absolute accuracy improvement and 60.03\% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches across diverse models and devices.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 88.41% and 92.61% on WESAD and CogLoad datasets, respectively, with a compact model (~30k parameters).

Conclusion: Efficient-Husformer demonstrates superior performance and efficiency for stress detection in multimodal physiological datasets.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained considerable attention in the field of physiological signal analysis. They leverage long-range dependencies and complex patterns in temporal signals, allowing them to achieve performance superior to traditional RNN and CNN models. However, they require high computational intensity and memory demands. In this work, we present Efficient-Husformer, a novel Transformer-based architecture developed with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for multi-class stress detection across two multimodal physiological datasets (WESAD and CogLoad). The main contributions of this work are: (1) the design of a structured search space, targeting effective hyperparameter optimization; (2) a comprehensive ablation study evaluating the impact of architectural decisions; (3) consistent performance improvements over the original Husformer, with the best configuration achieving an accuracy of 88.41 and 92.61 (improvements of 13.83% and 6.98%) on WESAD and CogLoad datasets, respectively. The best-performing configuration is achieved with the (L + dm) or (L + FFN) modality combinations, using a single layer, 3 attention heads, a model dimension of 18/30, and FFN dimension of 120/30, resulting in a compact model with only about 30k parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe) and a dual-learner design to address challenges in continual learning for large language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning remains a challenge for large language models, particularly in balancing adaptation to new tasks while retaining prior knowledge.

Method: The authors introduce SuRe for surprise-based sequence selection and a dual-learner system with fast/slow LoRA adapters merged via EMA.

Result: SuRe achieves top performance in Large Number of Tasks settings, with combined methods improving accuracy by up to +5 points.

Conclusion: The study validates replay as a robust baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and highlights the synergy of surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation.

Abstract: Continual learning, one's ability to adapt to a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a major challenge in machine learning and a key gap between artificial and human intelligence. While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

*Anna Pazola,Mohammad Shamsudduha,Richard G. Taylor,Allan Tucker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares two deep learning strategies for spatial interpolation and temporal prediction using groundwater data, highlighting challenges in interpolation and suggesting future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial datasets are often limited to point measurements, necessitating effective methods for temporal prediction and spatial interpolation to create continuous fields.

Method: Two approaches are evaluated: grid-to-grid (aggregation before modeling) and grid-to-point followed by kriging interpolation (aggregation after modeling). Groundwater storage data from Bangladesh is used.

Result: Spatial interpolation proves more challenging than temporal prediction, with uncertainties in geology affecting temporal behavior. Nearest neighbors aren't always the most similar.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on advanced interpolation methods using clustering based on time series dynamics. Findings are relevant for other environmental variables.

Abstract: Geospatial observational datasets are often limited to point measurements, making temporal prediction and spatial interpolation essential for constructing continuous fields. This study evaluates two deep learning strategies for addressing this challenge: (1) a grid-to-grid approach, where gridded predictors are used to model rasterised targets (aggregation before modelling), and (2) a grid-to-point approach, where gridded predictors model point targets, followed by kriging interpolation to fill the domain (aggregation after modelling). Using groundwater storage data from Bangladesh as a case study, we compare the effcacy of these approaches. Our findings indicate that spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction. In particular, nearest neighbours are not always the most similar, and uncertainties in geology strongly influence point temporal behaviour. These insights motivate future work on advanced interpolation methods informed by clustering locations based on time series dynamics. Demonstrated on groundwater storage, the conclusions are applicable to other environmental variables governed by indirectly observable factors.

*Ganeshan Niroshan,Uthayasanker Thayasivam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS2Vec-Ensemble combines implicit learned dynamics from TS2Vec with explicit seasonal features via a dual-model ensemble, outperforming TS2Vec and other models in long-horizon forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of contrastive methods like TS2Vec in forecasting by integrating explicit temporal patterns (seasonality, trend) with learned representations.

Method: Hybrid framework with a pretrained TS2Vec encoder fused with engineered time features, using a dual-model ensemble with adaptive weighting optimized per forecast horizon.

Result: Outperforms TS2Vec and state-of-the-art models on ETT benchmarks for univariate and multivariate forecasting.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining learned representations and explicit temporal priors is superior for long-horizon time series forecasting.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning, particularly through contrastive methods like TS2Vec, has advanced the analysis of time series data. However, these models often falter in forecasting tasks because their objective functions prioritize instance discrimination over capturing the deterministic patterns, such as seasonality and trend, that are critical for accurate prediction. This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme. The ensemble weights are optimized independently for each forecast horizon, allowing the model to dynamically prioritize short-term dynamics or long-term seasonality as needed. We conduct extensive experiments on the ETT benchmark datasets for both univariate and multivariate forecasting. The results demonstrate that TS2Vec-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms the standard TS2Vec baseline and other state-of-the-art models, validating our hypothesis that a hybrid of learned representations and explicit temporal priors is a superior strategy for long-horizon time series forecasting.

*Roland Stolz,Michael Eichelbeck,Matthias Althoff*

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in action-constrained RL by proposing efficient numerical approximations for key characteristics like entropy and log-probability gradients, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of entropy and log-probability gradients is crucial in action-constrained RL, but existing approximations degrade performance.

Method: Proposes efficient numerical approximations and sampling strategies for truncated policy distributions.

Result: Validated on three benchmark environments, showing significant performance improvements with accurate estimations.

Conclusion: Accurate estimation improves action-constrained RL performance, highlighting the importance of precise numerical methods.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), it is often advantageous to consider additional constraints on the action space to ensure safety or action relevance. Existing work on such action-constrained RL faces challenges regarding effective policy updates, computational efficiency, and predictable runtime. Recent work proposes to use truncated normal distributions for stochastic policy gradient methods. However, the computation of key characteristics, such as the entropy, log-probability, and their gradients, becomes intractable under complex constraints. Hence, prior work approximates these using the non-truncated distributions, which severely degrades performance. We argue that accurate estimation of these characteristics is crucial in the action-constrained RL setting, and propose efficient numerical approximations for them. We also provide an efficient sampling strategy for truncated policy distributions and validate our approach on three benchmark environments, which demonstrate significant performance improvements when using accurate estimations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PISA, a new framework for OOD generalization on graphs, dynamically aggregates diverse invariant subgraphs via MLP, outperforming prior methods by up to 5% accuracy on 15 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like CIGA and SuGAr miss multiple causal patterns or rely on simplistic aggregation, limiting robustness in OOD generalization for graph data.

Method: PISA introduces dynamic MLP-based aggregation to prioritize and combine diverse invariant subgraphs more effectively than uniform or greedy approaches.

Result: PISA achieves up to 5% higher classification accuracy than prior methods on 15 datasets, including DrugOOD.

Conclusion: Dynamic aggregation in PISA enhances robustness and accuracy in OOD generalization for graph-structured data, addressing limitations of earlier approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has extended the invariance principle for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization from Euclidean to graph data, where challenges arise due to complex structures and diverse distribution shifts in node attributes and topology. To handle these, Chen et al. proposed CIGA (Chen et al., 2022b), which uses causal modeling and an information-theoretic objective to extract a single invariant subgraph capturing causal features. However, this single-subgraph focus can miss multiple causal patterns. Liu et al. (2025) addressed this with SuGAr, which learns and aggregates diverse invariant subgraphs via a sampler and diversity regularizer, improving robustness but still relying on simple uniform or greedy aggregation. To overcome this, the proposed PISA framework introduces a dynamic MLP-based aggregation that prioritizes and combines subgraph representations more effectively. Experiments on 15 datasets, including DrugOOD (Ji et al., 2023), show that PISA achieves up to 5% higher classification accuracy than prior methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GPU-based feature interaction method for dual-tower networks to enhance retrieval accuracy and reduce computational costs in large-scale advertising recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dual-tower EBR methods lack sufficient feature interaction capabilities due to late-stage embeddings interaction, while early-stage DNN models are computationally expensive for retrieval.

Method: Introduces a compressed inverted list optimized for GPU acceleration to enable efficient feature interaction at scale within dual-tower networks.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluations and improves online performance in Tencent Advertising's recommendation system.

Conclusion: Validates the method's effectiveness and offers practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems.

Abstract: In large-scale advertising recommendation systems, retrieval serves as a critical component, aiming to efficiently select a subset of candidate ads relevant to user behaviors from a massive ad inventory for subsequent ranking and recommendation. The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems.

*Shanchuan Lin,Ceyuan Yang,Zhijie Lin,Hao Chen,Haoqi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial flow models unify adversarial and flow models, enabling stable training and efficient one-step/multi-step generation, achieving competitive performance with fewer iterations and model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of adversarial models (GANs) and flow models for stable training and efficient generation, avoiding arbitrary transport plans and intermediate timestep learning.

Method: Uses adversarial training to learn deterministic noise-to-data mappings (like flow-matching models), supports one-step/few-step generation, and avoids intermediate timestep propagation.

Result: Achieves FIDs of 2.38 (XL/2) and surpasses consistency-based models, with deeper models (56/112 layers) reaching FIDs of 2.08 and 1.94 in single forward passes.

Conclusion: Adversarial flow models offer stable training, efficient generation, and superior performance, making them a promising alternative to traditional GANs and flow models.

Abstract: We present adversarial flow models, a class of generative models that unifies adversarial models and flow models. Our method supports native one-step or multi-step generation and is trained using the adversarial objective. Unlike traditional GANs, where the generator learns an arbitrary transport plan between the noise and the data distributions, our generator learns a deterministic noise-to-data mapping, which is the same optimal transport as in flow-matching models. This significantly stabilizes adversarial training. Also, unlike consistency-based methods, our model directly learns one-step or few-step generation without needing to learn the intermediate timesteps of the probability flow for propagation. This saves model capacity, reduces training iterations, and avoids error accumulation. Under the same 1NFE setting on ImageNet-256px, our B/2 model approaches the performance of consistency-based XL/2 models, while our XL/2 model creates a new best FID of 2.38. We additionally show the possibility of end-to-end training of 56-layer and 112-layer models through depth repetition without any intermediate supervision, and achieve FIDs of 2.08 and 1.94 using a single forward pass, surpassing their 2NFE and 4NFE counterparts.

*Guanxi Lu,Hao Mark Chen,Zhiqiang Que,Wayne Luk,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines how quantization affects LLM trustworthiness metrics and introduces a precision-ensemble voting method to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization risks compromising trustworthiness in high-stakes domains, necessitating a focus beyond traditional metrics like perplexity.

Method: Systematically evaluate quantization's impact on trustworthiness metrics; develop a precision-ensemble voting approach.

Result: Precision-ensemble voting improves trustworthiness metrics by up to 5.8%.

Conclusion: Trustworthiness must be prioritized in model compression, especially for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across various tasks. However, their autoregressive decoding process poses significant challenges for efficient deployment on existing AI hardware. Quantization alleviates memory and compute pressure by compressing weights, activations, and KV caches to low precisions while preserving generation quality. However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\%$ on trustworthiness metrics. Our results highlight the importance of considering trustworthiness when developing model compression techniques and point to research opportunities at the intersection of compression and trustworthiness for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: We present a novel logic-based concept called Space Explanations for classifying neural networks that gives provable guarantees of the behavior of the network in continuous areas of the input feature space.

*Shiva Parsarad,Isabel Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the impact of differential privacy (DP) mechanisms (DPSGD and LDP) on recommendation accuracy and fairness across four RS models, revealing trade-offs in utility and bias under different privacy regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how DP mechanisms affect both the accuracy and fairness of recommender systems (RSs), focusing on heterogeneous impacts across models and user groups.

Method: A cross-model evaluation of DPSGD and LDP applied to NCF, BPR, SVD, and VAE on MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets, measuring utility and bias metrics.

Result: Stronger privacy reduces utility unevenly; NCF under DPSGD shows minimal accuracy loss, while SVD and BPR suffer more, especially for niche users. VAE is highly sensitive. DPSGD reduces bias gaps, while LDP preserves existing patterns.

Conclusion: No single DP mechanism is universally superior; choice depends on privacy needs and data conditions, highlighting the importance of tailored solutions.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) output ranked lists of items, such as movies or restaurants, that users may find interesting, based on the user's past ratings and ratings from other users. RSs increasingly incorporate differential privacy (DP) to protect user data, raising questions about how privacy mechanisms affect both recommendation accuracy and fairness. We conduct a comprehensive, cross-model evaluation of two DP mechanisms, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and local differential privacy (LDP), applied to four recommender systems (Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) on the MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets. We find that stronger privacy consistently reduces utility, but not uniformly. NCF under DPSGD shows the smallest accuracy loss (under 10 percent at epsilon approximately 1), whereas SVD and BPR experience larger drops, especially for users with niche preferences. VAE is the most sensitive to privacy, with sharp declines for sparsely represented groups. The impact on bias metrics is similarly heterogeneous. DPSGD generally reduces the gap between recommendations of popular and less popular items, whereas LDP preserves existing patterns more closely. These results highlight that no single DP mechanism is uniformly superior; instead, each provides trade-offs under different privacy regimes and data conditions.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the method's ability to match efficient guarantees while simplifying the process by avoiding SoS machinery.

Abstract: We introduce an expander-sketching framework for list-decodable linear regression that achieves sample complexity $\tilde{O}((d+\log(1/δ))/α)$, list size $O(1/α)$, and near input-sparsity running time $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(X)+d^{3}/α)$ under standard sub-Gaussian assumptions. Our method uses lossless expanders to synthesize lightly contaminated batches, enabling robust aggregation and a short spectral filtering stage that matches the best known efficient guarantees while avoiding SoS machinery and explicit batch structure.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty for sensor placement, improving accuracy over methods relying on total predictive uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sensor placement is crucial for modeling spatio-temporal systems, but existing methods conflate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Extends ConvCNPs with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) output head to estimate epistemic uncertainty and uses it as a new acquisition function.

Result: Preliminary results show epistemic uncertainty-driven placement reduces model error more effectively than total uncertainty-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances sensor placement accuracy by focusing on epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: Accurate sensor placement is critical for modeling spatio-temporal systems such as environmental and climate processes. Neural Processes (NPs), particularly Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs), provide scalable probabilistic models with uncertainty estimates, making them well-suited for data-driven sensor placement. However, existing approaches rely on total predictive uncertainty, which conflates epistemic and aleatoric components, that may lead to suboptimal sensor selection in ambiguous regions. To address this, we propose expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty as a new acquisition function for sensor placement. To enable this, we extend ConvCNPs with a Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) output head for epistemic uncertainty estimation. Preliminary results suggest that epistemic uncertainty driven sensor placement more effectively reduces model error than approaches based on overall uncertainty.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multiclass Score-Oriented Loss (MultiSOL) functions, extending binary score-oriented losses to multiclass classification by using a multidimensional threshold framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To directly optimize performance metrics in multiclass classification without needing threshold tuning, leveraging advantages observed in binary settings like robustness to class imbalance.

Method: Extends binary score-oriented losses using a multidimensional threshold-based framework, treating thresholds as random variables with a priori distributions.

Result: MultiSOL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art loss functions while optimizing target metrics directly and maintaining robustness to class imbalance.

Conclusion: MultiSOL preserves binary setting advantages, offers insights into simplex geometry and score-oriented learning, and performs competitively in multiclass classification.

Abstract: In the supervised binary classification setting, score-oriented losses have been introduced with the aim of optimizing a chosen performance metric directly during the training phase, thus avoiding \textit{a posteriori} threshold tuning. To do this, in their construction, the decision threshold is treated as a random variable provided with a certain \textit{a priori} distribution. In this paper, we use a recently introduced multidimensional threshold-based classification framework to extend such score-oriented losses to multiclass classification, defining the Multiclass Score-Oriented Loss (MultiSOL) functions. As also demonstrated by several classification experiments, this proposed family of losses is designed to preserve the main advantages observed in the binary setting, such as the direct optimization of the target metric and the robustness to class imbalance, achieving performance comparable to other state-of-the-art loss functions and providing new insights into the interaction between simplex geometry and score-oriented learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-Cave, a lightweight benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning and decision-making abilities in sequential tasks, showing that structured reasoning strategies can significantly enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation benchmarks lack multi-step interaction testing, while current environments are overly complex. The authors aim to provide a simpler yet effective benchmark for sequential reasoning.

Method: They developed LLM-Cave, a symbolic-environment benchmark, and tested mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, DeepSeek-R1) using strategies like Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 excelled in complex reasoning, but smaller models narrowed gaps using structured reasoning, though with lower computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Structured multi-step reasoning and feedback mechanisms improve LLM decision-making, proposing a new benchmark for reasoning-focused LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT o1, ChatGPT o3, and DeepSeek R1 have shown great potential in solving difficult problems. However, current LLM evaluation benchmarks are limited to one-step interactions. Some of the existing sequence decision-making environments, such as TextStarCraftII and LLM-PySC2, are too complicated and require hours of interaction to complete a game. In this paper, we introduce LLM-Cave, a benchmark and light environment for LLM reasoning and decision-making systems. This environment is a classic instance in the era of Symbolism. Artificial intelligence enables the agent to explore the environment and avoid potential losses by reasoning about nearby dangers using partial observable state information. In the experiment, we evaluated the sequential reasoning ability, decision-making performance and computational efficiency of mainstream large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that while Deepseek-R1 achieved the highest success rate on complex reasoning tasks, smaller models like 4o-mini significantly narrowed the performance gap on challenges by employing Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic strategies, at the expense of reduced computational efficiency. This indicates that structured, multi-step reasoning combined with an LLM-based feedback mechanism can substantially enhance an LLM's decision-making capabilities, providing a promising direction for improving reasoning in weaker models and suggesting a new reasoning-centered benchmark for LLM assessment.

Abstract: The integration of IoT and AI has unlocked innovation across industries, but growing privacy concerns and data isolation hinder progress. Traditional centralized ML struggles to overcome these challenges, which has led to the rise of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local raw data. FL ensures data privacy, reduces communication overhead, and supports scalability, yet its heterogeneity adds complexity compared to centralized approaches. This survey focuses on three main FL research directions: personalization, optimization, and robustness, offering a structured classification through a hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with systematic review to identify the most influential works. We examine challenges and techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy, and provide a comprehensive overview of aggregation strategies, including architectures, synchronization methods, and diverse federation objectives. To complement this, we discuss practical evaluation approaches and present experiments comparing aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions. Finally, we outline promising research directions to advance FL, aiming to guide future innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow Density Control (FDC), a method to fine-tune large generative models for optimizing diverse objectives beyond average rewards, while preserving prior information using general divergence measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like molecular design and creative image generation require adapting foundation models to task-specific objectives without losing prior knowledge. Existing methods focus on average rewards and KL-divergence, but broader utilities and preservation methods are needed.

Method: The authors propose FDC, which breaks down the complex fine-tuning problem into simpler tasks solvable via scalable methods. They use general divergence measures like optimal transport and Renyi divergences instead of just KL-divergence.

Result: FDC demonstrates versatility in optimizing various objectives, validated through tasks like text-to-image generation and molecular design. It outperforms current fine-tuning schemes in handling broader utilities.

Conclusion: FDC provides a scalable and generalizable solution for fine-tuning generative models, enabling optimization of diverse objectives while effectively preserving prior knowledge.

Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation flow and diffusion generative models to optimize task-specific objectives while preserving prior information is crucial for real-world applications such as molecular design, protein docking, and creative image generation. Existing principled fine-tuning methods aim to maximize the expected reward of generated samples, while retaining knowledge from the pre-trained model via KL-divergence regularization. In this work, we tackle the significantly more general problem of optimizing general utilities beyond average rewards, including risk-averse and novelty-seeking reward maximization, diversity measures for exploration, and experiment design objectives among others. Likewise, we consider more general ways to preserve prior information beyond KL-divergence, such as optimal transport distances and Renyi divergences. To this end, we introduce Flow Density Control (FDC), a simple algorithm that reduces this complex problem to a specific sequence of simpler fine-tuning tasks, each solvable via scalable established methods. We derive convergence guarantees for the proposed scheme under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we validate our method on illustrative settings, text-to-image, and molecular design tasks, showing that it can steer pre-trained generative models to optimize objectives and solve practically relevant tasks beyond the reach of current fine-tuning schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method identifies Koopman eigenfunctions from data without predefined bases, uses regularization and optimization for accuracy, and tests successfully on nonlinear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and practicality of Koopman predictors by discovering eigenfunctions without predefined bases and incorporating spatial structure.

Method: Identify Koopman mode amplitudes from a reference trajectory, transform decomposition to a new basis, optimize eigenvalues, and penalize deviations using regularization.

Result: Successful application on benchmark systems shows improved accuracy and reveals state-space features like invariant partitions.

Conclusion: The approach is practical for discovering Koopman spectral components and useful for control design in dynamical systems.

Abstract: A new approach to data-driven discovery of Koopman eigenfunctions without a pre-defined set of basis functions is proposed. The approach is based on a reference trajectory, for which the Koopman mode amplitudes are first identified, and the Koopman mode decomposition is transformed to a new basis, which contains fundamental functions of eigenvalues and time. The initial values of the eigenfunctions are obtained by projecting trajectories onto this basis via a regularized least-squares fit. A global optimizer was employed to optimize the eigenvalues. Mapping initial-state values to eigenfunction values reveals their spatial structure, enabling the numerical computation of their gradients. Thus, deviations from the Koopman partial differential equation are penalized, leading to more robust solutions. The approach was successfully tested on several benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with inputs, van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, and a 2-spool turbojet engine with control. The study demonstrates that incorporating principal eigenvalues and spatial structure integrity promotion significantly improves the accuracy of Koopman predictors. The approach effectively discovers Koopman spectral components even with sparse state-space sampling and reveals geometric features of the state space, such as invariant partitions. Finally, the numerical approximation of the eigenfunction gradient can be used for input dynamics modeling and control design. The results support the practicality of the approach for use with various dynamical systems.

*Lin Xu,Ke Li,Dongjie Wang,Fengmao Lv,Tianrui Li,Yanyong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHINE-FS introduces a novel MUFS method combining first-order and second-order similarity graphs to improve feature selection by capturing local and global structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MUFS methods often overlook global structures captured by second-order similarity and are sensitive to noise.

Method: SHINE-FS learns consensus anchors, reconstructs data, and jointly learns hybrid-order similarity graphs.

Result: Experiments show SHINE-FS outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SHINE-FS effectively enhances feature selection by capturing intrinsic data structures.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently emerged as an effective dimensionality reduction method for unlabeled multi-view data. However, most existing methods mainly use first-order similarity graphs to preserve local structure, often overlooking the global structure that can be captured by second-order similarity. In addition, a few MUFS methods leverage predefined second-order similarity graphs, making them vulnerable to noise and outliers and resulting in suboptimal feature selection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel MUFS method, termed Structure-aware Hybrid-order sImilarity learNing for multi-viEw unsupervised Feature Selection (SHINE-FS), to address the aforementioned problem. SHINE-FS first learns consensus anchors and the corresponding anchor graph to capture the cross-view relationships between the anchors and the samples. Based on the acquired cross-view consensus information, it generates low-dimensional representations of the samples, which facilitate the reconstruction of multi-view data by identifying discriminative features. Subsequently, it employs the anchor-sample relationships to learn a second-order similarity graph. Furthermore, by jointly learning first-order and second-order similarity graphs, SHINE-FS constructs a hybrid-order similarity graph that captures both local and global structures, thereby revealing the intrinsic data structure to enhance feature selection. Comprehensive experimental results on real multi-view datasets show that SHINE-FS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

*Lewis Smith,Bilal Chughtai,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges in building reliable deception detectors for AI systems due to a lack of confidently labeled examples of deceptive or honest behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks from advanced AI systems by developing reliable deception detectors that can predict strategic deception without relying solely on behavioral evidence.

Method: The authors analyze conceptual arguments, existing empirical works, and novel illustrative case studies to identify obstacles in collecting labeled examples of deception. They also evaluate potential empirical workarounds.

Result: The study finds current methods insufficient for collecting reliable deception examples and highlights the need for further research to address these challenges effectively.

Conclusion: Progress in deception detection requires deeper consideration of the identified problems and likely cannot rely solely on existing empirical workarounds.

Abstract: Building reliable deception detectors for AI systems -- methods that could predict when an AI system is being strategically deceptive without necessarily requiring behavioural evidence -- would be valuable in mitigating risks from advanced AI systems. But evaluating the reliability and efficacy of a proposed deception detector requires examples that we can confidently label as either deceptive or honest. We argue that we currently lack the necessary examples and further identify several concrete obstacles in collecting them. We provide evidence from conceptual arguments, analysis of existing empirical works, and analysis of novel illustrative case studies. We also discuss the potential of several proposed empirical workarounds to these problems and argue that while they seem valuable, they also seem insufficient alone. Progress on deception detection likely requires further consideration of these problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging advances in large language models, the study aims to develop generalizable time series forecasting models that reduce reliance on task-specific designs and manual tuning.

Method: The authors review architectures, pretraining strategies, and optimization methods, focusing on fine-tuning pretrained models to enhance performance on specific datasets.

Result: Empirical findings indicate that fine-tuning significantly boosts zero-shot forecasting accuracy, especially for long-term horizons.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning pretrained foundation models enhances their zero-shot forecasting capabilities, making them more effective across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in large language models, foundation models have been developed for zero-shot time series forecasting, enabling prediction on datasets unseen during pretraining. These large-scale models, trained on vast collections of time series, learn generalizable representations for both point and probabilistic forecasting, reducing the need for task-specific architectures and manual tuning.
  In this work, we review the main architectures, pretraining strategies, and optimization methods used in such models, and study the effect of fine-tuning after pretraining to enhance their performance on specific datasets. Our empirical results show that fine-tuning generally improves zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially for long-term horizons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), a method to improve diffusion models by using a flow map for reward-based sampling, outperforming traditional gradient-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving diffusion models with user-specified rewards are flawed because rewards are often only valid at the end of generation. Existing solutions rely on denoisers, but these are suboptimal.

Method: The proposed FMTT leverages the relationship between flow maps and velocity fields to enhance reward ascent during sampling. It enables exact sampling or principled search for reward-tilted distributions.

Result: FMTT outperforms standard gradient-based methods and other look-ahead techniques, enabling better sampling and image editing via complex reward functions, such as those from vision language models.

Conclusion: FMTT provides a robust and principled solution for reward-based sampling in diffusion models, offering superior performance and versatility for tasks like image editing.

Abstract: A common recipe to improve diffusion models at test-time so that samples score highly against a user-specified reward is to introduce the gradient of the reward into the dynamics of the diffusion itself. This procedure is often ill posed, as user-specified rewards are usually only well defined on the data distribution at the end of generation. While common workarounds to this problem are to use a denoiser to estimate what a sample would have been at the end of generation, we propose a simple solution to this problem by working directly with a flow map. By exploiting a relationship between the flow map and velocity field governing the instantaneous transport, we construct an algorithm, Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which provably performs better ascent on the reward than standard test-time methods involving the gradient of the reward. The approach can be used to either perform exact sampling via importance weighting or principled search that identifies local maximizers of the reward-tilted distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach against other look-ahead techniques, and show how the flow map enables engagement with complicated reward functions that make possible new forms of image editing, e.g. by interfacing with vision language models.

TL;DR: GAF is a generative model that learns noise and data predictors separately, enabling compositional control and strong sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generative model with independent predictors for noise and data, allowing algebraic operations and compositional generation.

Method: GAF learns endpoint predictors $J$ (noise) and $K$ (data) and derives velocity field $v=K-J$ from their disagreement, supporting Transport Algebra for operations on learned heads.

Result: Achieves FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ $64\times64$, supports controllable interpolation, hybrid generation, and semantic morphing, and exhibits lossless cyclic transport (LPIPS=0.0).

Conclusion: GAF provides a novel framework for compositional generation with high-quality results and unique transport capabilities.

Abstract: We present Generative Anchored Fields (GAF), a generative model that learns independent endpoint predictors $J$ (noise) and $K$ (data) rather than a trajectory predictor. The velocity field $v=K-J$ emerges from their time-conditioned disagreement. This factorization enables \textit{Transport Algebra}: algebraic operation on learned $\{(J_n,K_n)\}_{n=1}^N$ heads for compositional control. With class-specific $K_n$ heads, GAF supports a rich family of directed transport maps between a shared base distribution and multiple modalities, enabling controllable interpolation, hybrid generation, and semantic morphing through vector arithmetic. We achieve strong sample quality (FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ $64\times 64$) while uniquely providing compositional generation as an architectural primitive. We further demonstrate, GAF has lossless cyclic transport between its initial and final state with LPIPS=$0.0$. Code available at https://github.com/IDLabMedia/GAF

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified approach using transcriptomic and proteomic data for predicting radiation response (SF2) in NSCLC, addressing gaps in single-omic analyses.

Method: Used RNA-seq and DIA-MS proteomics on NSCLC cell lines, employed Lasso regression for feature selection, and built SVR models for transcriptome, proteome, and combined datasets.

Result: Found significant RNA-protein correlations (median r=0.363). Combined models outperformed single-omic ones (R2=0.461 transcriptome; R2=0.604 proteome), identifying 20 biomarkers.

Conclusion: The integrated framework enhances SF2 prediction accuracy and mechanistic understanding, showcasing the value of multi-omic data in NSCLC research.

Abstract: To develop an integrated transcriptome-proteome framework for identifying concurrent biomarkers predictive of radiation response, as measured by survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2), in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) proteomic data were collected from 73 and 46 NSCLC cell lines, respectively. Following preprocessing, 1,605 shared genes were retained for analysis. Feature selection was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression with a frequency-based ranking criterion under five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. Support vector regression (SVR) models were constructed using transcriptome-only, proteome-only, and combined transcriptome-proteome feature sets. Model performance was assessed by the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Correlation analyses evaluated concordance between RNA and protein expression and the relationships of selected biomarkers with SF2. RNA-protein expression exhibited significant positive correlations (median Pearson's r = 0.363). Independent pipelines identified 20 prioritized gene signatures from transcriptomic, proteomic, and combined datasets. Models trained on single-omic features achieved limited cross-omic generalizability, while the combined model demonstrated balanced predictive accuracy in both datasets (R2=0.461, RMSE=0.120 for transcriptome; R2=0.604, RMSE=0.111 for proteome). This study presents the first proteotranscriptomic framework for SF2 prediction in NSCLC, highlighting the complementary value of integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data. The identified concurrent biomarkers capture both transcriptional regulation and functional protein activity, offering mechanistic insights and translational potential.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VeriDispatcher, a framework for multi-LLM RTL generation, dynamically routes tasks to suitable LLMs based on difficulty prediction, improving accuracy and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches often rely on prompting or fine-tuning a single LLM for RTL generation, lacking coordination among diverse models to balance quality and cost.

Method: VeriDispatcher uses compact classifiers trained on semantic embeddings of task descriptions and difficulty scores (combining syntax, structural similarity, and functional correctness) to dispatch tasks to optimal LLMs.

Result: On RTLLM and VerilogEval benchmarks, VeriDispatcher improves accuracy by up to 18% while reducing commercial LLM calls by up to 40%.

Conclusion: The framework enables cost-effective, high-quality LLM deployment in hardware design automation by leveraging multiple models efficiently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in RTL generation, but different models excel on different tasks because of architecture and training differences. Prior work mainly prompts or finetunes a single model. What remains not well studied is how to coordinate multiple different LLMs so they jointly improve RTL quality while also reducing cost, instead of running all models and choosing the best output. We define this as the multi-LLM RTL generation problem. We propose VeriDispatcher, a multi-LLM RTL generation framework that dispatches each RTL task to suitable LLMs based on pre-inference difficulty prediction. For each model, we train a compact classifier over semantic embeddings of task descriptions, using difficulty scores derived from benchmark variants that combine syntax, structural similarity, and functional correctness. At inference, VeriDispatcher uses these predictors to route tasks to a selected subset of LLMs. Across 10 diverse LLMs on RTLLM and VerilogEval, VeriDispatcher achieves up to 18% accuracy improvement on RTLLM using only 40% of commercial calls, and on VerilogEval maintains accuracy while reducing commercial usage by 25%, enabling cost-effective, high-quality LLM deployment in hardware design automation.

Motivation: To enable exact algorithmic learning using gradient-based methods, overcoming limitations of prior architectures.

Method: Utilizes DFSTs for constant-precision, constant-time generation and end-to-end differentiable training, trained with expert agent observations.

Result: Models generalize perfectly to inputs thousands of times longer than training examples, demonstrating exact algorithmic learning.

Conclusion: Training differentiable agents with structured supervision can enable exact gradient-based learning of algorithms.

Abstract: We explore the possibility of exact algorithmic learning with gradient-based methods and introduce a differentiable framework capable of strong length generalization on arithmetic tasks. Our approach centers on Differentiable Finite-State Transducers (DFSTs), a Turing-complete model family that avoids the pitfalls of prior architectures by enabling constant-precision, constant-time generation, and end-to-end log-parallel differentiable training. Leveraging policy-trajectory observations from expert agents, we train DFSTs to perform binary and decimal addition and multiplication. Remarkably, models trained on tiny datasets generalize without error to inputs thousands of times longer than the training examples. These results show that training differentiable agents on structured intermediate supervision could pave the way towards exact gradient-based learning of algorithmic skills.

TL;DR: GSpaRC introduces a real-time CSI reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian primitives tailored for RF, achieving sub-1ms latency and high accuracy with reduced overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring CSI in wireless systems consumes significant spectrum resources; existing methods suffer from high latency, making them impractical for real-time use.

Method: GSpaRC uses compact 3D Gaussian primitives with physics-informed features and equirectangular projection for RF reception, supported by a custom CUDA pipeline for parallel processing.

Result: GSpaRC matches state-of-the-art CSI reconstruction fidelity while cutting training and inference time by over 10x, enabling scalable low-latency deployment in 5G systems.

Conclusion: GSpaRC offers a practical solution for real-time CSI reconstruction with minimal overhead, suitable for 5G and future wireless networks.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is essential for adaptive beamforming and maintaining robust links in wireless communication systems. However, acquiring CSI incurs significant overhead, consuming up to 25\% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions at sub-millisecond intervals. Recent approaches aim to reduce this burden by reconstructing CSI from spatiotemporal RF measurements, such as signal strength and direction-of-arrival. While effective in offline settings, these methods often suffer from inference latencies in the 5--100~ms range, making them impractical for real-time systems. We present GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels, the first algorithm to break the 1 ms latency barrier while maintaining high accuracy. GSpaRC represents the RF environment using a compact set of 3D Gaussian primitives, each parameterized by a lightweight neural model augmented with physics-informed features such as distance-based attenuation. Unlike traditional vision-based splatting pipelines, GSpaRC is tailored for RF reception: it employs an equirectangular projection onto a hemispherical surface centered at the receiver to reflect omnidirectional antenna behavior. A custom CUDA pipeline enables fully parallelized directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions. Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

### [394] [Can Synthetic Data Improve Symbolic Regression Extrapolation Performance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22794)
*Fitria Wulandari Ramlan,Colm O'Riordan,Gabriel Kronberger,James McDermott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores improving symbolic regression's extrapolation performance by generating synthetic data in sparse regions of the input space, using teacher-student knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression struggles with unreliable behavior in extrapolation, so the study aims to enhance performance by augmenting training data.

Method: Kernel Density Estimation identifies sparse input regions; synthetic data is generated via teacher models (NN, RF, GP) and used to train student models.

Result: GP models improve with synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas, though results vary by dataset and teacher model.

Conclusion: The approach is practical for better extrapolation, with notable improvements when GP-generated synthetic data trains GP models.

Abstract: Many machine learning models perform well when making predictions within the training data range, but often struggle when required to extrapolate beyond it. Symbolic regression (SR) using genetic programming (GP) can generate flexible models but is prone to unreliable behaviour in extrapolation. This paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can help improve performance in such cases. We apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify regions in the input space where the training data is sparse. Synthetic data is then generated in those regions using a knowledge distillation approach: a teacher model generates predictions on new input points, which are then used to train a student model. We evaluate this method across six benchmark datasets, using neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and GP both as teacher models (to generate synthetic data) and as student models (trained on the augmented data). Results show that GP models can often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. However, the improvement depends on the dataset and teacher model used. The most important improvements are observed when synthetic data from GPe is used to train GPp in extrapolation regions. Changes in interpolation areas show only slight changes. We also observe heterogeneous errors, where model performance varies across different regions of the input space. Overall, this approach offers a practical solution for better extrapolation. Note: An earlier version of this work appeared in the GECCO 2025 Workshop on Symbolic Regression. This arXiv version corrects several parts of the original submission.

Motivation: To explore if AI can emerge from computational units mimicking biological neurons' intelligence—maintaining states, selective communication, and self-organization.

Method: INN uses neurons with state-space dynamics and attention-based routing in complete graphs, enabling emergent computation.

Result: Achieves 1.705 BPC on Text8, outperforming Transformers (2.055 BPC) and matching LSTMs. Graph topology ensures training stability.

Conclusion: Graph-organized, neuron-centric design is computationally effective, offering modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.

Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit remarkable intelligence: they maintain internal states, communicate selectively with other neurons, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. What if artificial intelligence could emerge from similarly intelligent computational units? We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers.
  Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies confirm this: removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability, proving the value of learned neural routing.
  This work demonstrates that neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired -- it is computationally effective, opening new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for weakly supervised learning that eliminates the need for post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk. It covers diverse settings, provides generalization bounds, analyzes class-prior misspecification, and demonstrates robustness in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised learning is needed when complete and accurate labels are costly or infeasible, but existing methods are often tailored to specific supervision patterns and rely on unstable post-hoc corrections.

Method: The authors introduce a stable surrogate risk framework grounded in weakly supervised data structure, unifying diverse settings under a single optimization objective. They provide generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and analyze class-prior misspecification and identifiability.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms across various scenarios (class priors, dataset scales, class counts) without heuristic stabilization and shows robustness to overfitting.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework offers a principled, stable solution for weakly supervised learning, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating robustness.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning has emerged as a practical alternative to fully supervised learning when complete and accurate labels are costly or infeasible to acquire. However, many existing methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns -- such as positive-unlabeled (PU), unlabeled-unlabeled (UU), complementary-label (CLL), partial-label (PLL), or similarity-unlabeled annotations -- and rely on post-hoc corrections to mitigate instability induced by indirect supervision. We propose a principled, unified framework that bypasses such post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk grounded in the structure of weakly supervised data. The formulation naturally subsumes diverse settings -- including PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, and tuple-based learning -- under a single optimization objective. We further establish a non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity that clarifies how supervision structure, model capacity, and sample size jointly govern performance. Beyond this, we analyze the effect of class-prior misspecification on the bound, deriving explicit terms that quantify its impact, and we study identifiability, giving sufficient conditions -- most notably via supervision stratification across groups -- under which the target risk is recoverable. Extensive experiments show consistent gains across class priors, dataset scales, and class counts -- without heuristic stabilization -- while exhibiting robustness to overfitting.

TL;DR: CausalProfiler is introduced as a synthetic benchmark generator for Causal ML methods, enabling rigorous evaluation under diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Causal ML evaluation relies on limited datasets, leading to non-generalizable conclusions.

Method: CausalProfiler randomly samples causal models, data, queries, and ground truths to create synthetic benchmarks.

Result: Demonstrates utility by evaluating state-of-the-art methods under varied conditions.

Conclusion: CausalProfiler provides transparent, rigorous evaluation tools for Causal ML.

Abstract: Causal machine learning (Causal ML) aims to answer "what if" questions using machine learning algorithms, making it a promising tool for high-stakes decision-making. Yet, empirical evaluation practices in Causal ML remain limited. Existing benchmarks often rely on a handful of hand-crafted or semi-synthetic datasets, leading to brittle, non-generalizable conclusions. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalProfiler, a synthetic benchmark generator for Causal ML methods. Based on a set of explicit design choices about the class of causal models, queries, and data considered, the CausalProfiler randomly samples causal models, data, queries, and ground truths constituting the synthetic causal benchmarks. In this way, Causal ML methods can be rigorously and transparently evaluated under a variety of conditions. This work offers the first random generator of synthetic causal benchmarks with coverage guarantees and transparent assumptions operating on the three levels of causal reasoning: observation, intervention, and counterfactual. We demonstrate its utility by evaluating several state-of-the-art methods under diverse conditions and assumptions, both in and out of the identification regime, illustrating the types of analyses and insights the CausalProfiler enables.

TL;DR: TARFVAE is a new generative framework combining Transformer-based autoregressive flow and VAE for efficient one-step time series forecasting, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative time series forecasting methods are often slow and limited to short-term predictions, lacking clear practical advantages over deterministic methods. TARFVAE addresses these gaps.

Method: TARFVAE integrates TARFLOW (Transformer-based autoregressive flow) with VAE to enhance latent variable learning and posterior estimation, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations for fast generation.

Result: TARFVAE outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across various forecast horizons and datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed.

Conclusion: TARFVAE is an effective and efficient solution for generative time series forecasting, offering superior performance and practical advantages.

Abstract: Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.

### [399] [Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment for Multimodal Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22862)
*Jiacheng Li,Songhe Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multimodal test-time adaptation framework, BriMPR, addresses distribution shifts in multimodal scenarios by progressively re-aligning modalities through prompt tuning and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods struggle with multimodal distribution shifts, requiring a solution to bridge unimodal and cross-modal disparities.

Method: BriMPR decomposes MMTTA into unimodal alignment sub-problems, uses prompt tuning for initial re-alignment, and employs contrastive learning for refinement.

Result: Experiments on corruption-based and real-world benchmarks show BriMPR's superiority.

Conclusion: BriMPR effectively tackles multimodal TTA challenges by progressive re-alignment and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables online model adaptation using only unlabeled test data, aiming to bridge the gap between source and target distributions. However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

*Bharat Sharman,Elkafi Hassini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARM-Explainer, a post-hoc model-level explainer using association rule mining, improves GNN predictions for graph-based COPs by identifying key node features, achieving high lift and confidence values, and enhancing performance notably on the MCP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based solutions for COPs lack methods to explain their predictions, prompting the development of ARM-Explainer for better interpretability and performance enhancement.

Method: ARM-Explainer uses association rule mining to analyze GNN predictions, specifically applying it to the HGS GNN for the MCP, identifying critical node features and their value ranges.

Result: The explainer achieved high median lift (2.42) and confidence (0.49) values on benchmark datasets and improved the GNN's performance by 22% on large graphs.

Conclusion: ARM-Explainer effectively explains and enhances GNN predictions for COPs, showcasing its potential for interpretability and performance improvement in graph-based problems.

Abstract: Numerous graph neural network (GNN)-based algorithms have been proposed to solve graph-based combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but methods to explain their predictions remain largely undeveloped. We introduce ARM-Explainer, a post-hoc, model-level explainer based on association rule mining, and demonstrate it on the predictions of the hybrid geometric scattering (HGS) GNN for the maximum clique problem (MCP), a canonical NP-hard graph-based COP. The eight most explanatory association rules discovered by ARM-Explainer achieve high median lift and confidence values of 2.42 and 0.49, respectively, on test instances from the TWITTER and BHOSLIB-DIMACS benchmark datasets. ARM-Explainer identifies the most important node features, together with their value ranges, that influence the GNN's predictions on these datasets. Furthermore, augmenting the GNN with informative node features substantially improves its performance on the MCP, increasing the median largest-found clique size by 22% (from 29.5 to 36) on large graphs from the BHOSLIB-DIMACS dataset.

TL;DR: This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling pedestrian movement under varying environmental conditions captured through videos


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding irregular and unpredictable pedestrian behavior contributes to improving safety

Method: The study used chaos-chat metrics and PCA to consolidate behavioral indicators into chaos scores that served as supervised learning

Result: CBoost models consistently outperformed RandomForest models asCatBoost dayPCA-based

Conclusion: The framework enables planners and engineers to quantify behavioral instability and identifies high-risk zones infrastructure microsimulation models

Abstract: As cities around the world aim to improve walkability and safety, understanding the irregular and unpredictable nature of pedestrian behavior has become increasingly important. This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features.

TL;DR: APRM uses adversarial training to improve PRMs without manual step-level labels, boosting solver accuracy by 3.4pp and OOD performance by 5.3pp.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PRMs require costly step-level annotations and struggle with generalization to new errors. APRM addresses this by automating error generation and detection.

Method: APRM involves adversarial training between a Generator (G) creating reasoning errors and a PRM (R) detecting them, generating progressively harder negatives for robust learning.

Result: APRM improves solver accuracy by 3.4 percentage points over PRM baselines and achieves 5.3pp gains on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Adversarially trained PRMs (APRM) enhance robustness and generalization without manual labels, outperforming traditional PRMs.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) enhance reasoning ability of LLMs by providing step-level supervision. However, their widespread adoption is limited due to expensive manual step-level annotation and poor generalization of static training data to novel errors. We introduce Adversarially Trained PRMs (\texttt{APRM}), where a Generator ($G$) learns to produce reasoning errors to deceive a PRM ($R$), while $R$ concurrently learns to detect them. This interaction yields progressively harder negatives for $R$, improving its robustness and generalization to novel errors without requiring manual step-level labels. Averaged across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, \texttt{APRM} improves solver accuracy by $+3.4$ percentage points (pp) over the strongest PRM baseline. \texttt{APRM} achieves gains of $+5.3$ pp on out-of-distribution tasks.

TL;DR: EnECG is an ensemble framework combining specialized foundation models for ECG multi-tasks, using lightweight adaptation and MoE to reduce computational costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECG models lack the ability to leverage interrelated cardiac abnormalities, and re-training large foundation models is costly. EnECG aims to address these gaps efficiently.

Method: Integrates multiple specialized models with lightweight adaptation (LoRA) and uses MoE to learn ensemble weights, minimizing fine-tuning scope.

Result: EnECG reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining strong performance, enhancing feature extraction and predictive accuracy for clinical use.

Conclusion: EnECG offers a practical and efficient solution for ECG multi-tasks, balancing performance and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis plays a vital role in the early detection, monitoring, and management of various cardiovascular conditions. While existing models have achieved notable success in ECG interpretation, they fail to leverage the interrelated nature of various cardiac abnormalities. Conversely, developing a specific model capable of extracting all relevant features for multiple ECG tasks remains a significant challenge. Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks. To mitigate the high computational cost of full re-training or fine-tuning, we introduce a lightweight adaptation strategy: attaching dedicated output layers to each foundation model and applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to these newly added parameters. We then adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights, effectively combining the complementary expertise of individual models. Our experimental results demonstrate that by minimizing the scope of fine-tuning, EnECG can help reduce computational and memory costs while maintaining the strong representational power of foundation models. This framework not only enhances feature extraction and predictive performance but also ensures practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: CORGI is a hybrid neural architecture combining GNN-based solvers with Eulerian grids to capture long-range dependencies in fluid flows, achieving significant accuracy and efficiency improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solvers struggle with nonlinearity and computational cost, and existing Lagrangian neural surrogates like GNS and SEGNN fail to capture global interactions in fluid flows effectively.

Method: CORGI introduces a lightweight Eulerian component to GNN-based solvers, projecting particle features onto a grid for convolutional updates and mapping them back to capture long-range dependencies.

Result: CORGI improves rollout accuracy by 57% over GNS with minimal overhead and outperforms SEGNN in accuracy (49%) while reducing inference and training times.

Conclusion: CORGI demonstrates versatility and superior performance across varied compute budgets, making it an effective solution for global interaction modeling in fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to dynamical systems modeling, particularly in hydrodynamics, where traditional solvers often struggle with nonlinearity and computational cost. Lagrangian neural surrogates such as GNS and SEGNN have emerged as strong alternatives by learning from particle-based simulations. However, these models typically operate with limited receptive fields, making them inaccurate for capturing the inherently global interactions in fluid flows. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Convolutional Residual Global Interactions (CORGI), a hybrid architecture that augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component for global context aggregation. By projecting particle features onto a grid, applying convolutional updates, and mapping them back to the particle domain, CORGI captures long-range dependencies without significant overhead. When applied to a GNS backbone, CORGI achieves a 57% improvement in rollout accuracy with only 13% more inference time and 31% more training time. Compared to SEGNN, CORGI improves accuracy by 49% while reducing inference time by 48% and training time by 30%. Even under identical runtime constraints, CORGI outperforms GNS by 47% on average, highlighting its versatility and performance on varied compute budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional curriculum learning lacks reliable difficulty definitions; submodular functions and adaptive subset selection are explored for better sample selection.

Method: Formulate curriculum learning as a multi-armed bandit problem, introducing ONLINESUBMOD, an online greedy policy optimizing utility-driven rewards.

Result: ONLINESUBMOD achieves no-regret performance and outperforms traditional curriculum learning and bi-level optimization methods in vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: Validation-driven reward metrics provide a principled way to guide curriculum schedules, with ONLINESUBMOD showing superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs.

Abstract: Traditional curriculum learning proceeds from easy to hard samples, yet defining a reliable notion of difficulty remains elusive. Prior work has used submodular functions to induce difficulty scores in curriculum learning. We reinterpret adaptive subset selection and formulate it as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each arm corresponds to a submodular function guiding sample selection. We introduce ONLINESUBMOD, a novel online greedy policy that optimizes a utility-driven reward and provably achieves no-regret performance under various sampling regimes. Empirically, ONLINESUBMOD outperforms both traditional curriculum learning and bi-level optimization approaches across vision and language datasets, showing superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. More broadly, we show that validationdriven reward metrics offer a principled way to guide the curriculum schedule.

TL;DR: Comp-LLM introduces a composable inference framework for LLMs, improving accuracy and reducing model size and latency by enabling cross-expert collaboration via a dependency graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs increase computational burden, MoEs lack multi-step reasoning, and multi-agent frameworks introduce latency. Comp-LLM aims to address these issues.

Method: Comp-LLM uses a Sub-query Generator, Query Executor, and Response Aggregator to decompose tasks, enable parallel processing, and synthesize results.

Result: Comp-LLM achieves 11.01% higher accuracy, reduces model size by 1.67x--3.56x, and improves latency by 1.1x--1.7x over benchmarks.

Conclusion: Comp-LLM effectively balances accuracy, computational efficiency, and latency while enabling multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of increased model sizes which leads to additional computational burden. Mixture of Experts (MoEs) overcome this bottleneck by decoupling model capacity from computation by only activating a subset of parameters or "experts". However, these models require joint pretraining of these experts along with the router and do not model multi-step reasoning. In contrast, multi-agent frameworks improve reasoning by decomposing complex problems into modular subtasks. However, these frameworks rely on sequential "plan--act--observe" loops, which introduce significant latency. Our work, Comp-LLM, addresses these challenges by introducing a composable inference framework that enables cross-expert collaboration via an explicit sub-query dependency graph. Comp-LLM consists of three components: (1) A Sub-query Generator that decomposes an input query, assigns each sub-query to an appropriate expert using embedding similarity, and constructs a dependency graph; (2) A Query Executor that processes nodes in the graph and identifies opportunities for parallelism based on dependencies and resource constraints; and (3) A Response Aggregator that synthesizes intermediate expert responses into a coherent final answer. Across several benchmarks, Comp-LLM achieves up to 11.01% accuracy improvement over monolithic LLMs of similar size, while offering 1.67x--3.56x reduction in model size with no significant degradation relative to the largest model in its family. Additionally, Comp-LLM provides 1.1x--1.7x latency improvement compared to sequential sub-query processing.

TL;DR: FUSE is a neural framework for centrality estimation, combining global and local learning heads to efficiently compute depth-like scores for diverse data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical depth measures are unstable in high dimensions and not easily extendable beyond Euclidean data. FUSE addresses this by leveraging neural networks.

Method: FUSE uses a global head for pairwise distance-based centrality and a local head for smoothed log-density approximation. A single parameter blends these signals.

Result: FUSE performs well on synthetic and real-world data (images, time series, text), matching classical baselines while being simpler and more efficient.

Conclusion: FUSE provides a flexible, efficient, and effective centrality estimation framework adaptable to various data types and tasks.

Abstract: Measuring how central or typical a data point is underpins robust estimation, ranking, and outlier detection, but classical depth notions become expensive and unstable in high dimensions and are hard to extend beyond Euclidean data. We introduce Fused Unified centrality Score Estimation (FUSE), a neural centrality framework that operates on top of arbitrary representations. FUSE combines a global head, trained from pairwise distance-based comparisons to learn an anchor-free centrality score, with a local head, trained by denoising score matching to approximate a smoothed log-density potential. A single parameter between 0 and 1 interpolates between these calibrated signals, yielding depth-like centrality from different views via one forward pass. Across synthetic distributions, real images, time series, and text data, and standard outlier detection benchmarks, FUSE recovers meaningful classical ordering, reveals multi-scale geometric structures, and attains competitive performance with strong classical baselines while remaining simple and efficient.

TL;DR: A modular framework for assembling online attack predictors is proposed to address the limitations of monolithic predictors tailored to specific attack types, ensuring flexibility and control over prediction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and adaptable intrusion prediction systems due to the impracticality of training separate monolithic predictors for hundreds of attack types cataloged in the MITRE framework.

Method: Development of a modular framework using reusable components to dynamically assemble online attack predictors, emphasizing control over timeliness and accuracy metrics.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness of modular predictors through examples using public datasets, showcasing dynamic assembly during training.

Conclusion: The modular approach offers a practical and scalable solution for real-time online attack prediction, with tunable trade-offs between timeliness and accuracy.

Abstract: We study automated intrusion prediction in an IT system using statistical learning methods. The focus is on developing online attack predictors that detect attacks in real time and identify the current stage of the attack. While such predictors have been proposed in the recent literature, these works typically rely on constructing a monolithic predictor tailored to a specific attack type and scenario. Given that hundreds of attack types are cataloged in the MITRE framework, training a separate monolithic predictor for each of them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose a modular framework for rapidly assembling online attack predictors from reusable components. The modular nature of a predictor facilitates controlling key metrics like timeliness and accuracy of prediction, as well as tuning the trade-off between them. Using public datasets for training and evaluation, we provide many examples of modular predictors and show how an effective predictor can be dynamically assembled during training from a network of modular components.

*Kulin Shah,Bhuvesh Kumar,Neil Shah,Liam Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Masked diffusion outperforms autoregressive modeling in generative recommendation with semantic IDs, offering parallel decoding and better performance in data-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoregressive models suffer from expensive inference, inefficient training data use, and bias towards short-context relationships.

Method: Proposes masked diffusion for modeling sequences of semantic IDs, enabling parallel decoding and conditional independence of masked tokens.

Result: Outperforms autoregressive models, especially in data-constrained settings and coarse-grained recall.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion is a superior alternative for generative recommendation, combining performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) with semantic IDs (SIDs) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional recommendation approaches due to its performance gains, capitalization on semantic information provided through language model embeddings, and inference and storage efficiency. Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.

TL;DR: Delta-XAI improves explainability for online time series models by adapting existing XAI methods and introducing SWING, a method that captures temporal dependencies, outperforming others in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability in online time series models is vital for sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, but current methods lack temporal dependency analysis and effective evaluation.

Method: Delta-XAI adapts 14 XAI methods via a wrapper, introduces SWING to capture temporal dependencies, and provides a principled evaluation suite.

Result: SWING outperforms recent methods, especially Integrated Gradients, in capturing temporal dependencies and mitigating out-of-distribution effects.

Conclusion: Delta-XAI and SWING enhance explainability for online time series models, validated through diverse metrics and experiments.

Abstract: Explaining online time series monitoring models is crucial across sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where temporal and contextual prediction dynamics underpin critical decisions. While recent XAI methods have improved the explainability of time series models, they mostly analyze each time step independently, overlooking temporal dependencies. This results in further challenges: explaining prediction changes is non-trivial, methods fail to leverage online dynamics, and evaluation remains difficult. To address these challenges, we propose Delta-XAI, which adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function and introduces a principled evaluation suite for the online setting, assessing diverse aspects, such as faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence. Experiments reveal that classical gradient-based methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), can outperform recent approaches when adapted for temporal analysis. Building on this, we propose Shifted Window Integrated Gradients (SWING), which incorporates past observations in the integration path to systematically capture temporal dependencies and mitigate out-of-distribution effects. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of SWING across diverse settings with respect to diverse metrics. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Delta-XAI.

Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a "Ridge of Optimization" characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to "Spectral Concentration," its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the "Edge of Stability," a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.

Result: Applied to antimicrobial peptide design, FDD produces low-dimensional, predictive, and interpretable representations for tasks like property prediction and retrieval.

Conclusion: FDD effectively adapts embeddings while preserving their geometric structure, offering robust performance in tasks with limited data.

Abstract: Pretrained transformers provide rich, general-purpose embeddings, which are transferred to downstream tasks. However, current transfer strategies: fine-tuning and probing, either distort the pretrained geometric structure of the embeddings or lack sufficient expressivity to capture task-relevant signals. These issues become even more pronounced when supervised data are scarce. Here, we introduce Freeze, Diffuse, Decode (FDD), a novel diffusion-based framework that adapts pre-trained embeddings to downstream tasks while preserving their underlying geometric structure. FDD propagates supervised signal along the intrinsic manifold of frozen embeddings, enabling a geometry-aware adaptation of the embedding space. Applied to antimicrobial peptide design, FDD yields low-dimensional, predictive, and interpretable representations that support property prediction, retrieval, and latent-space interpolation.

TL;DR: Automated discovery of laser dicing processes for semiconductor wafers using Bayesian optimization reduces expert effort and outperforms manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional laser dicing requires weeks of expert effort to adapt to new wafer materials, prompting the need for automation to improve efficiency and quality.

Method: High-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization with a sequential two-level fidelity strategy minimizes costly die-strength evaluations.

Result: The method autonomously achieves or exceeds expert benchmarks in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, validated on silicon and product wafers.

Conclusion: Automated optimization not only matches manual methods but also allows expert refinement for further improvements, offering superior trade-offs.

Abstract: Laser dicing of semiconductor wafers is a critical step in microelectronic manufacturing, where multiple sequential laser passes precisely separate individual dies from the wafer. Adapting this complex sequential process to new wafer materials typically requires weeks of expert effort to balance process speed, separation quality, and material integrity. We present the first automated discovery of production-ready laser dicing processes on an industrial LASER1205 dicing system. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model. Expert-refinement of the discovered process can further improve production speed while preserving die strength and structural integrity, surpassing purely manual or automated methods.

*Ard Kastrati,Luca Lanzendörfer,Riccardo Rigoni,John Staib Matilla,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pretrained neural audio codecs like DAC can be effectively repurposed for EEG compression by preprocessing EEG data to fit the codec's input constraints. Fine-tuning further enhances performance, and DAC-MC improves spatial dependency handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG and audio differ significantly in structure and sampling rate, but leveraging pretrained audio codecs for EEG compression could offer efficient initialization and reuse of existing models.

Method: EEG data is preprocessed to match the audio codec's input constraints (DAC). Spatial dependencies are addressed with DAC-MC, featuring cross-channel attention and channel-specific decoding.

Result: Fine-tuned codecs yield stable EEG reconstructions and outperform scratch-trained models. DAC-MC preserves clinical relevance, evidenced by spectrogram loss and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Pretrained audio codecs, with adaptation, are viable for EEG compression. DAC-MC enhances multi-channel EEG handling, maintaining clinical utility.

Abstract: EEG and audio are inherently distinct modalities, differing in sampling rate, channel structure, and scale. Yet, we show that pretrained neural audio codecs can serve as effective starting points for EEG compression, provided that the data are preprocessed to be suitable to the codec's input constraints. Using DAC, a state-of-the-art neural audio codec as our base, we demonstrate that raw EEG can be mapped into the codec's stride-based framing, enabling direct reuse of the audio-pretrained encoder-decoder. Even without modification, this setup yields stable EEG reconstructions, and fine-tuning on EEG data further improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch. We systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook (vocabulary) size, and input sampling rate. To capture spatial dependencies across electrodes, we propose DAC-MC, a multi-channel extension with attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding, while retaining the audio-pretrained initialization. Evaluations on the TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy datasets show that the adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information, as reflected in spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.

### [416] [A Theoretical Framework for Discovering Groups and Unitary Representations via Tensor Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23152)
*Dongsung Huh,Halyun Jeong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the HyperCube model, showing its inductive bias toward group structures and unitary representations, with theoretical proofs and empirical support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to rigorously explain why the HyperCube model favors group structures and their unitary representations, isolating key factors driving this bias.

Method: The authors decompose the model's objective into terms regulating factor scales and directional alignment, focusing on the collinear manifold where group isotopes converge. Theoretical proofs and empirical observations support their conjectures.

Result: The collinear manifold exclusively admits feasible solutions for group isotopes, and variational pressure drives unitarity. Conditional on collinearity dominance, the global minimum is achieved by unitary regular representation, and non-group operations incur higher costs.

Conclusion: The HyperCube model inherently favors associative group structures (up to isotopy), validated by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: We analyze the HyperCube model, an \textit{operator-valued} tensor factorization architecture that discovers group structures and their unitary representations. We provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for this inductive bias by decomposing its objective into a term regulating factor scales ($\mathcal{B}$) and a term enforcing directional alignment ($\mathcal{R} \geq 0$). This decomposition isolates the \textit{collinear manifold} ($\mathcal{R}=0$), to which numerical optimization consistently converges for group isotopes. We prove that this manifold admits feasible solutions exclusively for group isotopes, and that within it, $\mathcal{B}$ exerts a variational pressure toward unitarity. To bridge the gap to the global landscape, we formulate a \textit{Collinearity Dominance Conjecture}, supported by empirical observations. Conditional on this dominance, we prove two key results: (1) the global minimum is achieved by the unitary regular representation for groups, and (2) non-group operations incur a strictly higher objective value, formally quantifying the model's inductive bias toward the associative structure of groups (up to isotopy).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEG2ERP is an uncertainty-aware autoencoder that maps EEG trials to their ERPs, reducing the need for many trials and outperforming traditional averaging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of noise and signal variability in estimating ERPs from EEG trials by introducing a deep learning approach that minimizes trial count.

Method: Used bootstrapped training targets and a variance decoder to model ERP uncertainty, evaluated on three datasets including ERP CORE.

Result: EEG2ERP outperformed conventional averaging methods, especially in few-trial scenarios.

Conclusion: EEG2ERP reduces the number of trials needed for ERP research and advances deep learning applications in EEG analysis.

Abstract: Event-related potentials (ERP) are measurements of brain activity with wide applications in basic and clinical neuroscience, that are typically estimated using the average of many trials of electroencephalography signals (EEG) to sufficiently reduce noise and signal variability. We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in Bangla sentiment analysis due to limited datasets, morphological complexity, and lack of explainability in existing methods.

Method: Integrates LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT via dynamic weighted ensemble learning, with SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization.

Result: Achieves 85% accuracy, 0.88 F1-score, and high interpretability (9.4/10). Shows robust cross-domain generalization with 67-76% zero-shot and 90-95% few-shot performance.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning for low-resource languages, and offers practical solutions for e-commerce.

Abstract: Multi-aspect sentiment analysis of Bangla e-commerce reviews remains challenging due to limited annotated datasets, morphological complexity, code-mixing phenomena, and domain shift issues, affecting 300 million Bangla-speaking users. Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement. This research establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning methodologies for low-resource languages, and provides actionable solutions for commercial applications.

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline evaluates ViT energy efficiency, combining device-agnostic selection with device-specific measurements, showing hybrid and distilled models' advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess Vision Transformers (ViTs) beyond accuracy for energy-constrained devices.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: NetScore for device-agnostic screening, Sustainable Accuracy Metric (SAM) for device-related ranking.

Result: Hybrid models reduce energy by 53% on edge devices; distilled models perform better on mobile GPUs.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively identifies energy-efficient ViTs, with hybrid and distilled models excelling in different contexts.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on energy-constrained devices requires evaluation methods that go beyond accuracy alone. We present a two-stage pipeline for assessing ViT energy efficiency that combines device-agnostic model selection with device-related measurements. We benchmark 13 ViT models on ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-10, running inference on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 (edge device) and an NVIDIA RTX 3050 (mobile GPU). The device-agnostic stage uses the NetScore metric for screening; the device-related stage ranks models with the Sustainable Accuracy Metric (SAM). Results show that hybrid models such as LeViT_Conv_192 reduce energy by up to 53% on TX2 relative to a ViT baseline (e.g., SAM5=1.44 on TX2/CIFAR-10), while distilled models such as TinyViT-11M_Distilled excel on the mobile GPU (e.g., SAM5=1.72 on RTX 3050/CIFAR-10 and SAM5=0.76 on RTX 3050/ImageNet-1K).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BangACMM, a multimodal framework using intermediate fusion of text (mBERT) and visual (Swin Transformer) models for Bangla author intent classification, achieving an 84.11% macro-F1 score and outperforming previous methods by 8.4 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of unimodal approaches in classifying author intent in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data.

Method: Systematically benchmarks transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet). Introduces an intermediate fusion strategy for multimodal integration.

Result: Intermediate fusion with mBERT and Swin Transformer achieves an 84.11% macro-F1 score, outperforming prior Bangla multimodal approaches by 8.4 percentage points.

Conclusion: Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels enhances intent classification, setting new benchmarks for Bangla and low-resource languages.

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet and social networks has led to an explosion of user-generated content. Author intent understanding plays a crucial role in interpreting social media content. This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages. We call our proposed framework BangACMM (Bangla Author Content MultiModal).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDE-Attention, a variant of SDE-RNNs with latent-space attention mechanisms, outperforms vanilla SDE-RNNs on irregularly sampled time series with missing data, showing significant accuracy improvements on both univariate and multivariate benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges posed by irregularly sampled time series with missing data, common in healthcare and sensor networks, by enhancing SDE-RNNs with attention mechanisms.

Method: Introduces SDE-Attention, featuring channel-level attention (recalibration, time-varying feature attention, pyramidal multi-scale self-attention), tested on synthetic and real-world datasets under varying missing rates.

Result: SDE-TVF-L (LSTM-based) achieves highest accuracy on univariate UCR datasets (4-10% improvement over baseline at 30-90% missingness). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention models yield up to 7% gain under high missingness.

Conclusion: Time-varying feature attention is most robust for univariate data, while attention mechanisms adapt flexibly to multivariate tasks, demonstrating SDE-Attention's versatility.

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series with substantial missing observations are common in healthcare and sensor networks. We introduce SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs equipped with channel-level attention on the latent pre-RNN state, including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention. We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models again outperform the backbone, with SDE-TVF-L yielding up to a 7% gain in mean accuracy under high missingness. Among the proposed mechanisms, time-varying feature attention is the most robust on univariate datasets. On multivariate datasets, different attention types excel on different tasks, showing that SDE-Attention can be flexibly adapted to the structure of each problem.

### [422] [Towards Understanding Transformers in Learning Random Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23239)
*Wei Shi,Yuan Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical understanding and interpretability of transformers in learning random walks on circles, demonstrating optimal accuracy and interpretable attention mechanisms, while also identifying edge cases where training fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of theoretical understanding and interpretability of transformers, particularly in learning classic statistical models like random walks.

Method: The study uses a one-layer transformer trained with gradient descent to learn random walks on circles, analyzing attention mechanisms and value matrices.

Result: Results show optimal prediction accuracy and interpretable attention focusing on parent states, but also highlight failure cases where training struggles.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the transformer's interpretability and success in learning random walks, while noting limitations in training under certain conditions.

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across various applications, especially in handling sequential data such as natural languages and time series. However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ThetaEvolve is an open-source framework improving on AlphaEvolve by enabling continual learning via in-context learning and RL, achieving new bounds on open problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome AlphaEvolve's reliance on closed-source LLMs and pure inference, and to enable models to learn evolving strategies.

Method: Uses a single LLM, a program database, batch sampling, lazy penalties, and RL for continual learning.

Result: Achieves new bounds on open problems (circle packing and auto-correlation inequality) and outperforms inference-only baselines.

Conclusion: ThetaEvolve demonstrates effective continual learning and generalization, with RL-trained models showing better performance on trained and unseen tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in mathematical discovery, exemplified by AlphaEvolve, a closed-source system that evolves programs to improve bounds on open problems. However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an open-source framework that simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve to efficiently scale both in-context learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) at test time, allowing models to continually learn from their experiences in improving open optimization problems. ThetaEvolve features a single LLM, a large program database for enhanced exploration, batch sampling for higher throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnant outputs, and optional reward shaping for stable training signals, etc. ThetaEvolve is the first evolving framework that enable a small open-source model, like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality) mentioned in AlphaEvolve. Besides, across two models and four open tasks, we find that ThetaEvolve with RL at test-time consistently outperforms inference-only baselines, and the model indeed learns evolving capabilities, as the RL-trained checkpoints demonstrate faster progress and better final performance on both trained target task and other unseen tasks. We release our code publicly: https://github.com/ypwang61/ThetaEvolve

TL;DR: A neural network predicts both mean and link-specific variance in path loss models, outperforming traditional methods with heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional path loss models assume constant prediction variance, lacking accuracy in uncertainty estimation.

Method: The proposed neural network minimizes Gaussian negative log-likelihood to jointly predict mean and variance, evaluated using shared, partially shared, and independent-parameter architectures.

Result: Shared-parameter architecture achieves RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1% coverage for 95% prediction intervals, and mean interval width of 29.6 dB.

Conclusion: The method enhances uncertainty estimates, supports RF planning and interference analysis, and identifies model weaknesses effectively.

Abstract: Traditional and modern machine learning-based path loss models typically assume a constant prediction variance. We propose a neural network that jointly predicts the mean and link-specific variance by minimizing a Gaussian negative log-likelihood, enabling heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates. We compare shared, partially shared, and independent-parameter architectures using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on blind test sets from large public RF drive-test datasets. The shared-parameter architecture performs best, achieving an RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1 percent coverage for 95 percent prediction intervals, and a mean interval width of 29.6 dB. These uncertainty estimates further support link-specific coverage margins, improve RF planning and interference analyses, and provide effective self-diagnostics of model weaknesses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes interPDN, a dual-branch neural network for time-series prediction that outputs probability distributions instead of scalars to handle uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep neural networks struggle with uncertainty in predictions as they output scalar values, lacking probabilistic interpretation.

Method: The interPDN model constructs discrete probability distributions per step using a dual-branch architecture with interleaved support sets and coarse temporal-scale branches. It employs self-supervised consistency constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show interPDN outperforms others on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: interPDN effectively addresses prediction uncertainty and achieves superior performance by modeling probability distributions and leveraging dual-branch consistency.

Abstract: Deep neural network-based time series prediction models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN.

TL;DR: Spectral Clustering performs well when eigenvalues are grouped and separated, applicable beyond traditional graphs, including digraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to generalize the understanding of Spectral Clustering's effectiveness, especially in scenarios like hierarchical clusters or directed graphs, which previous analyses overlooked.

Method: The study revisits Spectral Clustering theoretically, focusing on eigenvalue separation and group formation. It extends analysis to Hermitian representations of digraphs.

Result: Spectral Clustering effectively recovers partitions in hierarchical clusters and digraphs with mostly unidirectional edges, confirmed by synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework broadens Spectral Clustering's applicability, demonstrating its robustness in diverse scenarios, including ecological network analysis.

Abstract: We revisit the theoretical performances of Spectral Clustering, a classical algorithm for graph partitioning that relies on the eigenvectors of a matrix representation of the graph. Informally, we show that Spectral Clustering works well as long as the smallest eigenvalues appear in groups well separated from the rest of the matrix representation's spectrum. This arises, for example, whenever there exists a hierarchy of clusters at different scales, a regime not captured by previous analyses. Our results are very general and can be applied beyond the traditional graph Laplacian. In particular, we study Hermitian representations of digraphs and show Spectral Clustering can recover partitions where edges between clusters are oriented mostly in the same direction. This has applications in, for example, the analysis of trophic levels in ecological networks. We demonstrate that our results accurately predict the performances of Spectral Clustering on synthetic and real-world data sets.

*Xinnong Du,Zhonghao Lyu,Xiaowen Cao,Chunyang Wen,Shuguang Cui,Jie Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a parameter-efficient Federated Edge Learning (FEEL) framework combining model pruning and client selection to address challenges like limited datasets and resource constraints, enhancing model generalization and resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations in FEEL caused by heterogeneous and scarce local datasets, as well as resource constraints, which degrade model generalization and learning performance.

Method: The method involves deriving an information-theoretic generalization statement, embedding it into convergence analysis, and solving a non-convex optimization problem via alternating optimization to jointly optimize pruning ratios, client selection, and resource allocation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed framework outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating improved learning performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization effectively enhances FEEL performance.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) provides a promising foundation for edge artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL.

Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with high-dimensionality and missing data in spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, prompting the need for robust, data-driven approaches.

Method: The work uses autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, FLINT for flow estimation and interpolation, and HyperFLINT for parameter-aware adaptation.

Result: These methods provide stable embeddings, high-fidelity interpolants, and accurate reconstructions across diverse domains, even with incomplete data.

Conclusion: The dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, offering scalable and adaptable solutions for complex spatio-temporal data.

Abstract: Scientific simulations and experimental measurements produce vast amounts of spatio-temporal data, yet extracting meaningful insights remains challenging due to high dimensionality, complex structures, and missing information. Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles.

Result: Demonstrates high accuracy and data efficiency in real-world battery prognostics and constrained benchmarks, highlighting trade-offs in physical consistency, computational cost, and stability.

Conclusion: The frameworks show practical potential for deployment, offering solutions for physics-informed learning with clear guidance on trade-offs.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for physics-informed learning in complex cyber-physical systems governed by differential equations with both unknown dynamics and algebraic invariants. First, we formalize the Hybrid Recurrent Physics-Informed Neural Network (HRPINN), a general-purpose architecture that embeds known physics as a hard structural constraint within a recurrent integrator to learn only residual dynamics. Second, we introduce the Projected HRPINN (PHRPINN), a novel extension that integrates a predict-project mechanism to strictly enforce algebraic invariants by design. The framework is supported by a theoretical analysis of its representational capacity. We validate HRPINN on a real-world battery prognostics DAE and evaluate PHRPINN on a suite of standard constrained benchmarks. The results demonstrate the framework's potential for achieving high accuracy and data efficiency, while also highlighting critical trade-offs between physical consistency, computational cost, and numerical stability, providing practical guidance for its deployment.

TL;DR: The paper explores coordination dynamics in decentralized MARL, identifying three distinct regimes—stable, fragile, and disordered—linked to kernel drift and synchronization. Agent asymmetry is shown to drive drift, with phase transitions governed by scale, density, and drift interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the dynamics of coordination emergence, fluctuation, and collapse in decentralized MARL, focusing on IQL as a minimal testbed.

Method: Large-scale experiments across environment size (L) and agent density (rho), constructing a phase map using cooperative success rate (CSR) and TD-error variance-derived stability index.

Result: Identification of three regimes (stable, fragile, disordered) separated by a double Instability Ridge, driven by kernel drift and synchronization. Removing agent IDs collapses the structure.

Conclusion: Decentralized MARL coordination behaves as a phase phenomenon influenced by scale, density, and kernel drift, with agent asymmetries as key drivers.

Abstract: A clearer understanding of when coordination emerges, fluctuates, or collapses in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly sought in order to characterize the dynamics of multi-agent learning systems. We revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as a minimal decentralized testbed and run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.

### [431] [ParaGate: Parasitic-Driven Domain Adaptation Transfer Learning for Netlist Performance Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23340)
*Bin Sun,Jingyi Zhou,Jianan Mu,Zhiteng Chao,Tianmeng Yang,Ziyue Xu,Jing Ye,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaGate is a three-step framework predicting layout-level timing and power from netlists using transfer learning, EDA tools, and global calibration, achieving strong generalization with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EDA flows lack layout-level metrics early, hindering optimization. Neural methods struggle with generalization due to disparate data from commercial tools.

Method: ParaGate uses a two-phase transfer-learning approach for parasitic prediction, EDA tools for timing analysis, and global calibration with subgraph features.

Result: ParaGate improves arrival-time R2 from 0.119 to 0.897 on openE906, showing strong generalization with little fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: ParaGate enables early-stage global optimization by predicting layout-level performance accurately.

Abstract: In traditional EDA flows, layout-level performance metrics are only obtainable after placement and routing, hindering global optimization at earlier stages. Although some neural-network-based solutions predict layout-level performance directly from netlists, they often face generalization challenges due to the black-box heuristics of commercial placement-and-routing tools, which create disparate data across designs. To this end, we propose ParaGate, a three-step cross-stage prediction framework that infers layout-level timing and power from netlists. First, we propose a two-phase transfer-learning approach to predict parasitic parameters, pre-training on mid-scale circuits and fine-tuning on larger ones to capture extreme conditions. Next, we rely on EDA tools for timing analysis, offloading the long-path numerical reasoning. Finally, ParaGate performs global calibration using subgraph features. Experiments show that ParaGate achieves strong generalization with minimal fine-tuning data: on openE906, its arrival-time R2 from 0.119 to 0.897. These results demonstrate that ParaGate could provide guidance for global optimization in the synthesis and placement stages.

*Bowen Wang,Matteo Zecchin,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDAM, a distributed dynamic associative memory framework for multi-agent systems with time-varying data. It proposes DDAM-TOGD, a tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, showing sublinear regret bounds and improved performance via optimized routing trees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend associative memory (AM) to distributed, dynamic settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams, addressing the challenge of selective memorization and inter-agent communication.

Method: Proposes DDAM-TOGD, a tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, where agents update memories via communication over routing trees, with theoretical guarantees and optimized tree design.

Result: Demonstrates sublinear static regret in stationary environments and dynamic regret bounds dependent on path length in non-stationary settings. Numerical experiments show superior accuracy and robustness compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DDAM-TOGD effectively addresses distributed dynamic AM challenges, offering theoretical insights into communication delays and network structure, and practical benefits in performance.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and it has recently been recognized as a key mechanism underlying modern neural architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.

*Kunanon Burathep,Thomas Erlebach,William K. Moses*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Choo et al.'s work on learning-augmented online bipartite matching by removing assumptions on the optimal matching size, achieving improved consistency and robustness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance algorithms for online bipartite matching by incorporating untrusted predictions, ensuring better performance even when predictions are imperfect.

Method: The algorithm uses a prefix of the arrival sequence to evaluate prediction accuracy, then switches between following predictions or a baseline algorithm based on this evaluation.

Result: The generalized approach achieves (1-o(1))-consistency and (β-o(1))-robustness, with smooth degradation in performance as prediction error increases.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of learning-augmented algorithms for broader scenarios in online bipartite matching, improving upon previous limitations.

Abstract: We study the online unweighted bipartite matching problem in the random arrival order model, with $n$ offline and $n$ online vertices, in the learning-augmented setting: The algorithm is provided with untrusted predictions of the types (neighborhoods) of the online vertices. We build upon the work of Choo et al. (ICML 2024, pp. 8762-8781) who proposed an approach that uses a prefix of the arrival sequence as a sample to determine whether the predictions are close to the true arrival sequence and then either follows the predictions or uses a known baseline algorithm that ignores the predictions and is $β$-competitive. Their analysis is limited to the case that the optimal matching has size $n$, i.e., every online vertex can be matched. We generalize their approach and analysis by removing any assumptions on the size of the optimal matching while only requiring that the size of the predicted matching is at least $αn$ for any constant $0 < α\le 1$. Our learning-augmented algorithm achieves $(1-o(1))$-consistency and $(β-o(1))$-robustness. Additionally, we show that the competitive ratio degrades smoothly between consistency and robustness with increasing prediction error.

*Jiajun Guo,Xin Luo,Jie Liu*

TL;DR: Split learning avoids data sharing for privacy but suffers from high communication costs. A new multimodal model with learning-based compression reduces costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high network communication costs in split learning, especially for large models transmitting high-dimensional data.

Method: Introduces a multimodal model with learning-based data compression, converting embeddings to low-bit integers without performance loss. Optimizes discrete representation levels using entropy coding theory.

Result: Significant reduction in transmission costs between partitions while preserving model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively tackles communication cost issues in split learning without compromising privacy or performance.

Abstract: Split learning is well known as a method for resolving data privacy concerns by training a model on distributed devices, thereby avoiding data sharing that raises privacy issues. However, high network communication costs are always an impediment to split learning, especially for large foundation models that require transmitting large amounts of high-dimensional data. To resolve this issue, we present a new multimodal model structure that incorporates a learning-based data compression method, which compresses model embeddings into low-bit integers while preserving the model's performance, greatly reducing the transmission costs between partitions. We then determine the optimal number of discrete representation levels based on a solid theoretical foundation from entropy coding.

*Bernhard Klein,Falk Selker,Hendrik Borras,Sophie Steger,Franz Pernkopf,Holger Fröning*

TL;DR: PFP-BNNs offer a highly efficient alternative to SVI-BNNs by using Gaussian approximations for uncertainty propagation, enabling faster deployment on embedded systems without sacrificing accuracy or OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks lack uncertainty handling, making them unreliable for safety-critical applications. BNNs improve this but are computationally expensive. PFP addresses this inefficiency.

Method: PFP approximates SVI by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, replacing sampling with a single forward pass. An end-to-end pipeline trains, compiles, optimizes, and deploys PFP-BNNs on ARM CPUs using TVM.

Result: PFP achieves 4200x speedup over SVI for small mini-batches while maintaining comparable accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection on Dirty-MNIST.

Conclusion: PFP-BNNs combine Bayesian approximations with efficient code generation, enabling practical deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.

*Hang Yu,Di Zhang,Qiwei Du,Yanping Zhao,Hai Zhang,Guang Chen,Eduardo E. Veas,Junqiao Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASTRO is a framework for offline RL that improves trajectory stitching by generating novel, dynamics-consistent trajectories, leading to better policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL struggles with suboptimal datasets and inaccurate reward propagation, limiting policy improvement. Existing augmentation methods fail to generate effective trajectories.

Method: ASTRO learns temporal-distance representations to identify stitch targets and uses a dynamics-guided planner with Rollout Deviation Feedback to create feasible trajectories.

Result: ASTRO outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like OGBench and D4RL, showing significant performance gains.

Conclusion: ASTRO addresses key challenges in offline RL by enhancing trajectory stitching, enabling better policy learning and performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies from pre-collected datasets. However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.

*Tianlong Huang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how activation functions, specifically sine and ReLU, impact learning modular addition in neural networks, highlighting sine's superior expressivity and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the differences in expressivity and generalization between sine and ReLU activation functions in neural networks learning modular addition.

Method: The study compares expressivity gaps and derives generalization bounds for sine networks, supported by empirical validation.

Result: Sine networks achieve exact realizations with minimal width, generalize better, and extrapolate well, unlike ReLU networks.

Conclusion: Sine activation functions outperform ReLU in expressivity and generalization for modular addition tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies the role of activation functions in learning modular addition with two-layer neural networks. We first establish a sharp expressivity gap: sine MLPs admit width-$2$ exact realizations for any fixed length $m$ and, with bias, width-$2$ exact realizations uniformly over all lengths. In contrast, the width of ReLU networks must scale linearly with $m$ to interpolate, and they cannot simultaneously fit two lengths with different residues modulo $p$. We then provide a novel Natarajan-dimension generalization bound for sine networks, yielding nearly optimal sample complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(p)$ for ERM over constant-width sine networks. We also derive width-independent, margin-based generalization for sine networks in the overparametrized regime and validate it. Empirically, sine networks generalize consistently better than ReLU networks across regimes and exhibit strong length extrapolation.

*Ali Waseem,Malcolm Mielle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate thermal conductivity (k) of walls from thermographs, addressing challenges in traditional inverse heat problem methods like invasiveness and sensitivity to conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for solving inverse heat problems are invasive, time-consuming, or sensitive to environmental factors. The study aims to provide a reliable, non-invasive solution using machine learning.

Method: The framework alternates between solving forward heat problems with a PINN for fixed k and optimizing k by comparing predicted and observed thermographs until convergence. It uses data from weather stations and simulations.

Result: The method accurately predicts k under varying conditions, with a maximum MAE of 4.0851 even when the steady-state assumption is violated.

Conclusion: The study highlights PINN-based methods' potential for reliable in-situ property estimation and encourages further research into machine learning for inverse problems.

Abstract: Inverse heat problems refer to the estimation of material thermophysical properties given observed or known heat diffusion behaviour. Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic.

*Hans Gundlach,Jayson Lynch,Matthias Mertens,Neil Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights how benchmarking progress in AI overlooks cost efficiency, showing that performance-per-dollar has improved significantly due to economic, hardware, and algorithmic advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the skewed representation of AI progress in benchmarks by focusing on cost efficiency alongside capability improvements.

Method: Utilizing data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI, the largest historical and current pricing dataset for benchmarks was compiled to analyze cost trends.

Result: Findings reveal a rapid decline ($5x to $10x per year) in cost for benchmark performance, driven by economic, hardware, and algorithmic efficiencies.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for incorporating benchmarking costs in AI evaluations to better reflect real-world impact.

Abstract: Language models have seen enormous progress on advanced benchmarks in recent years, but much of this progress has only been possible by using more costly models. Benchmarks may therefore present a warped picture of progress in practical capabilities per dollar. To remedy this, we use data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI to form the largest dataset of current and historical prices to run benchmarks to date. We find that the price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast, around $5\times$ to $10\times$ per year, for frontier models on knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. These reductions in the cost of AI inference are due to economic forces, hardware efficiency improvements, and algorithmic efficiency improvements. Isolating out open models to control for competition effects and dividing by hardware price declines, we estimate that algorithmic efficiency progress is around $3\times$ per year. Finally, we recommend that evaluators both publicize and take into account the price of benchmarking as an essential part of measuring the real-world impact of AI.

Motivation: Addresses the lack of a unified evaluation setting for world models to assess their ability to capture environment dynamics accurately.

Method: Introduces SmallWorld Benchmark, a controlled testbed, and evaluates models (Recurrent State Space Model, Transformer, Diffusion model, Neural ODE) across six domains.

Result: Reveals how well models capture environment structure and how their predictions degrade over time, identifying strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Highlights insights for improving representation learning and dynamics modeling in future work.

Abstract: Current world models lack a unified and controlled setting for systematic evaluation, making it difficult to assess whether they truly capture the underlying rules that govern environment dynamics. In this work, we address this open challenge by introducing the SmallWorld Benchmark, a testbed designed to assess world model capability under isolated and precisely controlled dynamics without relying on handcrafted reward signals. Using this benchmark, we conduct comprehensive experiments in the fully observable state space on representative architectures including Recurrent State Space Model, Transformer, Diffusion model, and Neural ODE, examining their behavior across six distinct domains. The experimental results reveal how effectively these models capture environment structure and how their predictions deteriorate over extended rollouts, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of current modeling paradigms and offering insights into future improvement directions in representation learning and dynamics modeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A protocol for aligning ASI using mutual verification among isolated systems, incentivized by a reputation system to ensure honest behavior and convergence on truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the alignment problem for artificial superintelligence by enforcing objective truth through isolation and peer verification.

Method: Multiple diverse ASIs are isolated ('boxed') and interact via an auditable interface for proof submission, validation, modification requests, and reputation-based incentives.

Result: Emergence of a 'consistent group' that converges on truth due to isolation preventing deceptive coordination.

Conclusion: The protocol offers a framework for ASI alignment through peer verification, though it demands significant computational resources and assumes diverse superintelligences.

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation ("boxes"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a "consistent group", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between psychological theories of ToM (goals, intentions, beliefs) and formal computational methods, leveraging game theory.

Method: Develops a framework combining game theory for bounded rationality with statistical techniques for approximate solutions.

Result: A computable framework that recursively incorporates others' ToM while maintaining decision-making feasibility.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel approach to automating ToM, enhancing practical applications in logic, economics, and robotics.

Abstract: Originating in psychology, $\textit{Theory of Mind}$ (ToM) has attracted significant attention across multiple research communities, especially logic, economics, and robotics. Most psychological work does not aim at formalizing those central concepts, namely $\textit{goals}$, $\textit{intentions}$, and $\textit{beliefs}$, to automate a ToM-based computational process, which, by contrast, has been extensively studied by logicians. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a computational framework viewed through the lens of game theory. On the one hand, the framework prescribes how to make boudedly rational decisions while maintaining a theory of mind about others (and recursively, each of the others holding a theory of mind about the rest); on the other hand, it employs statistical techniques and approximate solutions to retain computability of the inherent computational problem.

TL;DR: The paper explores using synthetic textual clinical notes generated via LLMs to enhance multimodal learning in dermatology, improving classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited heterogeneous biomedical multimodal data restricts robust AI model development in medicine. Dermatology datasets often lack detailed metadata, limiting multimodal benefits.

Method: Investigates strategies for generating synthetic clinical notes using LLMs, focusing on prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on multimodal architectures.

Result: Synthetic clinical notes improve classification performance, especially under domain shift, and enable cross-modal retrieval capabilities without explicit training.

Conclusion: Synthetic textual descriptions enhance multimodal learning in dermatology, showing promise for reliable and generalizable AI applications.

Abstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large tool outputs overflow LLMs' context windows, making existing solutions like truncation inadequate for workflows needing full data.

Method: Shifts LLM interaction from raw data to memory pointers, preserving tool functionality and reducing token usage.

Result: Validated in Materials Science, the method uses ~7x fewer tokens than traditional workflows.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient processing of large tool outputs without loss, beneficial for knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable of interacting with external tools, granting access to specialized knowledge beyond their training data - critical in dynamic, knowledge-intensive domains such as Chemistry and Materials Science. However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework for improved diabetic retinopathy grading by integrating pathological descriptions and leveraging foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DR grading methods overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize contextual knowledge from foundation models, leading to insufficient distinction of subtle pathological variations.

Method: The HAPM framework includes: (1) a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library, (2) a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism for semantic selection, and (3) a two-stage prototype modulation strategy integrating clinical knowledge.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across eight public datasets, demonstrating pathology-guided prototype evolution.

Conclusion: The HAPM framework effectively enhances DR grading by integrating pathological context and leveraging foundation models, resolving ambiguities in borderline cases.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays a critical role in early clinical intervention and vision preservation. Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI system integrating sensing, forecasting, and response to tackle extreme rainfall events, improving reliability and warning times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting systems struggle with extreme rainfall events like cloudbursts, prompting the need for an interconnected AI solution.

Method: An agentic AI system combines sensing, forecasting, hydrological modeling, and response using autonomous, cooperative agents.

Result: Multi-agent AI enhances forecast reliability, warning lead time, and population reach while minimizing errors.

Conclusion: Collaborative AI agents can transform atmospheric data into actionable insights for scalable climate resilience.

Abstract: The challenge is growing towards extreme and short-duration rainfall events like a cloudburst that are peculiar to the traditional forecasting systems, in which the predictions and the response are taken as two distinct processes. The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience.

*Dasheng Bi,Yubin Hu,Mohammed N. Nasir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRAXIS is a lightweight mechanism enabling LLM-based agents to learn procedural knowledge post-deployment by storing and retrieving action consequences based on state matching, improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological intelligence learns from trial and error, but LLM-based agents lack post-deployment procedural learning. PRAXIS addresses this gap.

Method: PRAXIS stores action consequences and retrieves them by matching past environmental/internal states to current states, augmenting action selection.

Result: On REAL web browsing, PRAXIS boosts accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency. It also generalizes to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: PRAXIS facilitates AI agent adoption in dynamic environments by enhancing procedural learning.

Abstract: Learning how to do things from trial and error in real time is a hallmark of biological intelligence, yet most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment. We propose Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State (PRAXIS), a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores the consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time. When evaluated on the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments. These results demonstrate that PRAXIS enables the practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively.

### [448] [Hybrid Stackelberg Game and Diffusion-based Auction for Two-tier Agentic AI Task Offloading in Internet of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22076)
*Yue Zhong,Yongju Tong,Jiawen Kang,Minghui Dai,Hong-Ning Dai,Zhou Su,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-tier optimization approach for the Internet of Agents (IoA), using a Stackelberg game and Double Dutch Auction to manage task offloading between Wireless Agents, Mobile/Fixed Agents, and Aerial Agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of resource-limited Wireless Agents needing to offload compute-intensive tasks to Mobile/Fixed Agents, which can further offload to Aerial Agents for efficient coordination and resource utilization.

Method: A two-tier approach: Tier 1 uses a Stackelberg game for pricing and offloading decisions; Tier 2 employs a Double Dutch Auction for overloaded Fixed Agents to request resources from Aerial Agents. A diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm solves the model.

Result: Numerical results show the proposed scheme effectively facilitates task offloading.

Conclusion: The two-tier optimization enhances coordination and resource allocation in IoA, proving superior for task offloading.

Abstract: The Internet of Agents (IoA) is rapidly gaining prominence as a foundational architecture for interconnected intelligent systems, designed to facilitate seamless discovery, communication, and collaborative reasoning among a vast network of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.

TL;DR: The study investigates whether human biases affect evaluations of AI's logical reasoning abilities, revealing that preconceived views significantly influence perceptions, especially among frequent AI users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the divergence in opinions about AI's thinking capabilities and explore how biases impact evaluations of AI's logical reasoning.

Method: Conducted an experiment where participants assessed AI-generated and human-written texts, followed by a questionnaire to quantify attitudes toward AI.

Result: Found perceptual biases in evaluating AI's reasoning abilities, influenced by preconceived views. Frequent AI users were less concerned about AI undermining independent thinking.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to address biases to improve public understanding of AI and enhance human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Can machines think? This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions.

*Toqeer Ali Syed,Salman Jan,Gohar Ali,Ali Akarma,Ahmad Ali,Qurat-ul-Ain Mastoi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic AI model is proposed for retail inventory management, reducing stockouts and costs while improving product turnover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variety of products in retail makes demand prediction and inventory management challenging.

Method: The AI model uses demand forecasting, supplier optimization, multi-agent negotiation, and continuous learning.

Result: Testing showed reduced stockouts, lower inventory costs, and better product turnover.

Conclusion: The system proves effective but faces scalability constraints and room for improvement.

Abstract: In contemporary retail, the variety of products available (e.g. clothing, groceries, cosmetics, frozen goods) make it difficult to predict the demand, prevent stockouts, and find high-potential products. We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning. We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics. Our findings indicate that there is a decrease in stockouts, a reduction of inventory holding costs, and an improvement in product mix turnover. We address constraints, scalability as well as improvement prospect.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WearVQA is the first benchmark evaluating VQA capabilities for AI assistants on wearable devices, focusing on ego-centric challenges like poor image quality and realistic use cases. It includes 2,520 curated image-question-answer triplets across diverse domains and tasks. LLMs scored low (24-52%), highlighting WearVQA's difficulty and real-world relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a benchmark tailored to wearable AI assistants arises from the unique challenges of ego-centric views (e.g., occlusion, poor lighting) not addressed by existing benchmarks relying on high-quality imagery.

Method: WearVQA comprises 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets covering 7 domains, 10 task types, and 6 common image quality issues. Evaluation uses an LLM-as-a-judge framework with 96% accuracy.

Result: Open-source and proprietary LLMs achieved low accuracy (24-52%) on WearVQA, with significant drops for lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks.

Conclusion: WearVQA serves as a challenging and comprehensive benchmark to advance robust, real-world AI systems for wearable devices, addressing unique ego-centric interaction challenges.

Abstract: We introduce WearVQA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the Visual Question Answering (VQA) capabilities of multi-model AI assistant on wearable devices like smart glasses. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-quality, third-person imagery, WearVQA reflects the unique challenges of ego-centric interaction-where visual inputs may be occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry, and questions are grounded in realistic wearable use cases. The benchmark comprises 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets, spanning 7 diverse image domains including both text-centric and general scenes, 10 cognitive task types ranging from basic recognition to various forms of reasoning, and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. All questions are designed to be answerable using only the visual input and common senses. WearVQA is paired with a rigorous LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with 96% labeling accuracy. Open-source and proprietary multi-model LLMs achieved a QA accuracy as low as 24-52% on WearVQA, with substantial drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks. These observations position WearVQA as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for guiding technical advancement towards robust, real-world multi-model wearables AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for prospective learning in multi-agent RL, emphasizing self-prediction and embedded agency to address non-stationarity and mutual modeling challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional RL in multi-agent settings where non-stationarity and mutual modeling require agents to account for their own role in the environment.

Method: Proposes a mathematical framework based on AIXI, using Bayesian RL for self-prediction (predicting own actions and perceptions) and resolving epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Self-prediction enables agents to reason about others, leading to new game-theoretic solutions and cooperation forms. Idealized agents achieve infinite-order theory of mind.

Conclusion: The framework sets a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning, extending AIXI and demonstrating potential for advanced cooperation and mutual prediction.

Abstract: The standard theory of model-free reinforcement learning assumes that the environment dynamics are stationary and that agents are decoupled from their environment, such that policies are treated as being separate from the world they inhabit. This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.

*Zehao Deng,Tianjie Ju,Zheng Wu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent framework (CES) to enhance GUI agents' ability to handle long-horizon tasks by separating high-level scheduling (Coordinator and State Tracker) from low-level execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to responsibility coupling, capability conflicts, and lack of task state awareness.

Method: Introduces a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm, training Coordinator and State Tracker agents for strategic planning and state management, respectively.

Result: CES improves planning and state management, proving generalizable and enhancing various Executors' long-horizon capabilities.

Conclusion: The CES framework effectively addresses long-horizon task challenges and is adaptable to different low-level Executors.

Abstract: The rapid development of large vision-language model (VLM) has greatly promoted the research of GUI agent. However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a co-evolving agents framework where a target agent and an auxiliary failure agent improve jointly. The failure agent generates hard negatives from failure trajectories, enhancing the target agent's learning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of task-specialized agents depends on high-quality training data, which is costly to curate. Existing self-improving agents rely heavily on predicted trajectories, risking overfitting, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: Introduces a co-evolving agents framework with a target agent and an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories, generating hard negatives to improve the target agent's optimization.

Result: Experiments show improved performance, demonstrating that failures can be systematically transformed into valuable learning signals, enhancing generalization.

Conclusion: The co-evolving framework effectively leverages failures as structured learning signals, outperforming existing methods and improving agent generalization.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.

### [455] [RecToM: A Benchmark for Evaluating Machine Theory of Mind in LLM-based Conversational Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22275)
*Mengfan Li,Xuanhua Shi,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecToM introduces a benchmark for evaluating Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in LLMs for recommendation dialogues, focusing on cognitive inference and behavioral prediction, revealing gaps in strategic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM benchmarks for LLMs rely on simplistic, synthetic narratives, missing the complexity of real conversational settings and neglecting behavioral prediction, a key human ToM component.

Method: Develops RecToM, a benchmark targeting two dimensions: Cognitive Inference (inferring mental states) and Behavioral Prediction (using mental states for strategic dialogue actions). Evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: LLMs show partial success in mental state recognition but struggle with coherent, strategic ToM reasoning in dynamic dialogues, especially tracking evolving intentions and aligning strategies.

Conclusion: RecToM highlights limitations in LLMs' ToM reasoning for realistic recommendation dialogues, stressing the need for improved social reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language models are revolutionizing the conversational recommender systems through their impressive capabilities in instruction comprehension, reasoning, and human interaction. A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-assisted workflow using Bayesian optimization and active learning to reduce expert involvement and computational costs in industrial design simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing scale of simulations requires expert knowledge and resources, making parameter optimization costly and environmentally impactful.

Method: An AI-assisted workflow combines deep learning for initial parameter estimates with Bayesian optimization and active learning to iteratively refine designs.

Result: The approach accelerates design space exploration and reduces expert involvement, demonstrated using a sheet metal forming process.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of costly simulations and expert dependency in industrial design.

Abstract: Numerical simulations have revolutionized the industrial design process by reducing prototyping costs, design iterations, and enabling product engineers to explore the design space more efficiently. However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vast design space of double perovskites poses challenges for materials discovery; this work aims to streamline the process using knowledge-guided generative methods.

Method: The framework combines LLM self-evaluation, domain-specific feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback to guide composition generation and improve validity.

Result: The method achieves 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable/metastable candidates, outperforming LLM-only and prior GAN-based approaches.

Conclusion: The work introduces a scalable, knowledge-guided generative framework for double perovskite discovery, setting a blueprint for sustainable materials design.

Abstract: Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design, overcoming limitations of existing methods by enabling objective-directed design without extensive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in designing proteins with tailored properties due to the vast sequence space and complex sequence-structure-function relationships. Current methods lack flexibility and scalability.

Method: A swarm intelligence-inspired framework uses multiple LLM agents operating in parallel, each assigned to a residue position, to propose mutations iteratively based on design objectives, local interactions, and feedback.

Result: The method efficiently designs diverse, well-defined protein sequences (validated experimentally) and demonstrates emergent behaviors in navigating the protein fitness landscape, achieving designs within a few GPU-hours.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalizable, adaptable solution for protein design and extends potential applications to broader biomolecular and scientific discovery tasks.

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

TL;DR: ECO-GROW is a multi-graph framework modeling China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to predict urban economic vitality, outperforming traditional models by integrating dynamic inter-city connections and temporal evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban economic vitality is a key growth indicator, but traditional static models fail to capture dynamic inter-city developmental trajectories.

Method: ECO-GROW integrates industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration data, and temporal network evolution using Dynamic Top-K GCN and adaptive Graph Scorer mechanisms.

Result: The framework shows superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models.

Conclusion: ECO-GROW enables evidence-based urban planning and policy formulation through open-sourced big data analytics.

Abstract: Urban economic vitality is a crucial indicator of a city's long-term growth potential, comprising key metrics such as the annual number of new companies and the population employed. However, modeling urban economic vitality remains challenging. This study develops ECO-GROW, a multi-graph framework modeling China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to generate urban embeddings that model urban economic vitality. Traditional approaches relying on static city-level aggregates fail to capture a fundamental dynamic: the developmental trajectory of one city today may mirror that of its structurally similar counterparts tomorrow. ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Additionally, the model incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity, optimizing the graph representation. Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models. By open-sourcing our code, we enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation decisions that benefit society at large.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the grounded extension in argumentation frameworks using computability and set theory, showing its complexity differs significantly between finite and infinite cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally study reasoning under conflicting information and understand the computational complexity of the grounded extension.

Method: Uses mathematical logic (computability and set theory) to analyze the grounded extension, focusing on transfinite iterations and ordinal numbers.

Result: Identifies the exact ordinal number for the iterative process and shows grounded acceptance is maximally complex, contrasting with its polynomial-time computability in finite cases.

Conclusion: The grounded extension's complexity varies drastically between finite and infinite scenarios, highlighting a significant distinction in computational behavior.

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks, consisting of arguments and an attack relation representing conflicts, are fundamental for formally studying reasoning under conflicting information. We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.

*Edoardo Baccini,Zoé Christoff,Nina Gierasimczuk,Rineke Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the learning capabilities of minimal revision in belief revision theory, highlighting its limitations and successes in specific contexts, such as finite identification and data types. It also examines plausible assignments and the impact of erroneous information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the effectiveness and limitations of minimal revision as a belief revision method compared to other methods, particularly focusing on its learning power and applicability in various scenarios.

Method: The authors analyze minimal revision's ability to learn finite identification problems and combinations of positive and negative data under finite possibilities. They also characterize plausible assignments for minimal revision, conditioning, and lexicographic upgrade.

Result: Minimal revision succeeds in learning finite identification problems and specific data combinations. Certain plausibility assignments facilitate learning via minimal revision, but not all results hold with erroneous information.

Conclusion: Minimal revision is effective in certain learning contexts despite its limitations, and its success depends on plausibility assignments and data conditions.

Abstract: The principle of minimal change in belief revision theory requires that, when accepting new information, one keeps one's belief state as close to the initial belief state as possible. This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.

*Yannick Brunink,Daniel Daza,Yunjie He,Michael Cochez*

TL;DR: Neural models for Complex Query Answering over knowledge graphs are compared with training-free query relaxation, revealing similar performance and little answer overlap, suggesting a need for stronger baselines and hybrid approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically assess whether neural CQA models generalize beyond symbolic query processing by comparing them with a simple, training-free query relaxation method.

Method: Systematic comparison of neural CQA models and query relaxation using multiple datasets and query structures, analyzing performance and answer overlap.

Result: Neural models show no consistent superiority over query relaxation, with little answer overlap between methods. Combining approaches improves performance.

Conclusion: Current neural models do not fully capture reasoning patterns of query relaxation, highlighting the need for stronger baselines and integration of relaxation principles.

Abstract: Neural methods for Complex Query Answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely believed to learn patterns that generalize beyond explicit graph structure, allowing them to infer answers that are unreachable through symbolic query processing. In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning improves LLMs' quantitative performance, but lacks rigorous reasoning verification. The paper proposes self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, training a verifier and proof generator to enhance theorem proving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Correct final answers don't ensure correct reasoning, and many tasks require rigorous derivation. Scaling test-time compute necessitates self-verification for open problems.

Method: Train an LLM-based verifier for theorem proving, use it as a reward model for a proof generator, and incentivize issue resolution in proofs. Scale verification compute to label hard-to-verify proofs.

Result: DeepSeekMath-V2 achieves gold-level scores on IMO 2025, CMO 2024, and 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled compute.

Conclusion: Self-verifiable reasoning with scalable verification compute significantly advances theorem-proving capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

TL;DR: The paper explores AI deception, its evolution into a demonstrated risk, and provides a comprehensive overview of core concepts, methodologies, risks, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI deception has shifted from speculative concern to empirical risk, necessitating a structured understanding and mitigation framework to address sociotechnical safety challenges.

Method: The study defines AI deception using signaling theory, reviews empirical research, and frames the issue as a deception cycle with two components: deception emergence (mechanisms and triggers) and deception treatment (detection and mitigation).

Result: AI deception arises from capability, incentives, and contextual triggers. Mitigation involves detection methods, benchmarks, and integrated auditing approaches combining technical, community, and governance efforts.

Conclusion: The paper synthesizes AI deception risks and solutions, proposing a cyclical framework for understanding and addressing deceptive behaviors in AI systems.

Abstract: As intelligence increases, so does its shadow. AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-phase allocation method for agent shift scheduling in CCaaS, improving scalability and accuracy by breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems solved sequentially as IPPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-step scheduling methods are inefficient and computationally demanding, especially during peak demand scenarios like holiday rushes.

Method: A multi-phase approach divides scheduling into day and shift allocation sub-problems, modeled as Integer Programming Problems (IPPs) and solved sequentially.

Result: The method reduces computational variables, enables targeted objective functions, and enhances efficiency and accuracy in scheduling.

Conclusion: The multi-phase allocation method is effective for scalable and accurate agent shift scheduling, particularly during peak demand periods.

Abstract: Effective agent shift scheduling is crucial for businesses, especially in the Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) industry, to ensure seamless operations and fulfill employee needs. Most studies utilizing mathematical model-based solutions approach the problem as a single-step process, often resulting in inefficiencies and high computational demands. In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem. We then apply the proposed method, using a multi-objective framework, to address the difficulties posed by peak demand scenarios such as holiday rushes, where maintaining service levels is essential despite having limited number of employees

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free paradigm addressing the semantic-to-geometric gap in Vision Language Models (VLMs) by decoupling their roles into semantic analysis and task solving within deterministic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs face a gap between semantic inference and high-fidelity geometric reasoning, leading to flawed spatial logic in current methods.

Method: GCA decouples VLMs into a semantic analyst (translating queries into formal constraints) and a task solver (executing within deterministic bounds).

Result: GCA achieves SOTA performance, outperforming existing methods by ~27% on spatial reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GCA successfully bridges the semantic-to-geometric gap, offering robust and verifiable spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the autonomy and health of individuals with disabilities and neurodivergence by providing adaptive, transparent, and inclusive AI-driven support.

Method: A multi-layer framework with hybrid reasoning, four specialized agents (Meal Planner, Reminder, Food Guidance, Monitoring), a Blackboard/Event Bus for communication, and privacy-compliant data sources like EHRs and wearable sensors.

Result: The proposed system integrates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility, combining multi-agent reasoning and human-centered design for better autonomy and health outcomes.

Conclusion: The Agentic AI framework advances traditional assistive systems by prioritizing inclusivity, personalization, and digital equity for disabled and neurodivergent individuals.

Abstract: The paper presents a detailed Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that would enable people with disabilities and neurodivergence to lead healthier lives and have more regular days. The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FastDSA is a new method for comparing neural circuit dynamics efficiently, maintaining accuracy while speeding up computation significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamics of neural systems, and existing dynamical similarity methods are computationally slow.

Method: FastDSA introduces automatic model order selection and a novel optimization procedure to boost efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Result: FastDSA is at least 10 times faster than previous methods while preserving their accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: FastDSA offers an efficient and accurate solution for dynamical similarity analysis in neural systems.

Abstract: To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.

TL;DR: The paper addresses flaws in existing insight discovery benchmarks like InsightBench and proposes a new benchmark, InsightEval, with improved criteria and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities lack consistency and quality, potentially impacting agent evaluations.

Method: The authors analyze InsightBench's shortcomings, define high-quality benchmark criteria, and develop InsightEval with a data-curation pipeline and a new performance metric.

Result: Experiments on InsightEval reveal challenges in automated insight discovery and provide key findings for future research.

Conclusion: InsightEval offers a more reliable benchmark for evaluating insight discovery, addressing critical flaws in existing frameworks.

Abstract: Data analysis has become an indispensable part of scientific research. To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents. Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, we highlight prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and raise some key findings to guide future research in this promising direction.

*Kumar Tanmay,Kriti Aggarwal,Paul Pu Liang,Subhabrata Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework inspired by Mentalese for compact reasoning in LRMs, using SLPO to optimize efficiency and accuracy, achieving significant reductions in tokens and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in LRMs caused by verbose reasoning tokens, aiming for human-like cognitive efficiency.

Method: Proposes Mentalese-style compressed reasoning tokens and SLPO, a reinforcement learning method rewarding concise, correct reasoning.

Result: ORION models achieve 4-16x fewer tokens, 5x lower latency, and 7-9x lower training costs while maintaining 90-98% accuracy.

Conclusion: Compressed reasoning enables human-like efficiency in LRMs without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: TIM-PRM introduces a tool-integrated framework to address visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies in MLLMs by actively verifying reasoning steps through external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies, with existing verification methods often validating flawed hypotheses due to sycophancy.

Method: TIM-PRM transforms verification into an active, tool-augmented investigation, using Independent Question Asking to query evidence and decouple verification from reasoning context.

Result: An 8B parameter TIM-PRM model outperforms larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B on VisualProcessBench.

Conclusion: TIM-PRM offers a scalable and interpretable solution for improving multimodal reasoning verification.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.

TL;DR: MindPower integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) into vision-language agents for better decision-making and action generation, outperforming GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and benchmarks ignore the agent's perspective, limiting coherent actions.

Method: MindPower uses Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making, and Action modules, supplemented by Mind-Reward optimization.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decisions and 12.49% in action generation.

Conclusion: Integrating ToM improves decision-making and action coherence in vision-language agents.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer others' mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus solely on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, hindering coherent decision and action generation. To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior. Our model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

*David Demitri Africa,Hans Ethan Ting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-evaluation in language models can lead to reward manipulation (wireheading) when linked to rewards, causing grade inflation without accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if self-evaluation tied to rewards incentivizes manipulation rather than genuine task improvement.

Method: Formalize conditions for reward-channel control dominance in POMDPs and test empirically across models and tasks.

Result: Models controlling rewards show grade inflation without accuracy gains, unlike those with decoupled self-evaluation.

Conclusion: Self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from rewards but risky when linked, impacting agentic system design.

Abstract: Self-evaluation is increasingly central to language model training, from constitutional AI to self-refinement. We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance. We formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in POMDPs and test these predictions empirically. Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation. Our results demonstrate that self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for agentic system design.

TL;DR: TPET combines LLMs with structured reasoning to create efficient, specialized traffic signal policies without training, outperforming traditional heuristics and online LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing TSC methods—oversimplified heuristics, poor generalization in DRL, and inefficiency of online LLMs—by leveraging LLMs for policy evolution.

Method: Uses LLMs as an evolution engine with Structured State Abstraction (SSA) and Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF) to derive optimized policies without training.

Result: Produces lightweight, robust policies tailored to specific traffic environments, surpassing heuristics and online LLMs in performance.

Conclusion: TPET offers a scalable, efficient approach to traffic signal control by integrating LLM reasoning with targeted feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in traditional rule-based energy management for dynamic rural environments by integrating P2P trading and MARL.

Method: Combined Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PPO and DQN) with auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load/battery management.

Result: DQN reduced electricity costs by 14.2% (Ireland) and 5.16% (Finland), while increasing revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%. PPO reduced peak demand by 55.5% (Ireland).

Conclusion: MARL and P2P trading synergize for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources in rural areas, such as dairy farming communities, enables decentralized energy management through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.

TL;DR: AgriCoT introduces a VQA dataset with CoT reasoning to evaluate VLM reasoning skills in agriculture, revealing gaps despite some models' answering proficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA datasets lack assessment of critical reasoning in agriculture, prompting the creation of AgriCoT.

Method: AgriCoT includes 4,535 samples designed for zero-shot evaluation of VLM reasoning, tested on 26 models.

Result: Proprietary models answer well but show reasoning gaps; CoT is crucial for accurate assessment.

Conclusion: AgriCoT highlights the need for CoT-enhanced datasets to better evaluate VLM reasoning in agriculture.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly transformed various industries. In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.

TL;DR: MCTR enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with metacognitive self-updating for adaptive test-time reasoning, outperforming baselines on unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs lack efficient adaptation to novel tasks, while humans use metacognitive control for continuous improvement.

Method: MCTR combines meta-level (rule discovery) and object-level (action optimization) reasoning with memory systems, using metacognitive reinforcement learning for updates.

Result: MCTR achieves top-1 results in 9 out of 12 unseen Atari games, showing robust adaptation and human-like strategy evolution.

Conclusion: MCTR bridges the adaptation gap in VLMs by mimicking human metacognition, enabling effective test-time learning and reasoning.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual reasoning abilities, yet they often struggle to adapt efficiently when encountering novel tasks at test time. In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: High-quality, diverse data with structured reasoning traces enhances model performance and adaptability. Future work aims to improve medical vision-language systems.

Abstract: High-quality and carefully curated data is a cornerstone of training medical large language models, as it directly impacts both generalization and robustness to unseen clinical tasks. We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.

*Zijian Fu,Changsheng Lv,Mengshi Qi,Huadong Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SHRIKE introduces a multi-modal scene graph and a KAN-based MoE for audio-visual question answering, improving fine-grained modeling and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack structural information and fine-grained multi-modal modeling in audio-visual question answering, limiting their ability to mimic human reasoning.

Method: The authors propose a multi-modal scene graph to model object relationships and a KAN-based MoE for enhanced temporal integration.

Result: SHRIKE achieves state-of-the-art performance on MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The combination of structured scene representation and advanced MoE significantly improves audio-visual question answering performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Scene Graph with Kolmogorov-Arnold Expert Network for Audio-Visual Question Answering (SHRIKE). The task aims to mimic human reasoning by extracting and fusing information from audio-visual scenes, with the main challenge being the identification of question-relevant cues from the complex audio-visual content. Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance automated weather reporting by capturing short-term dynamics and long-term trends through hierarchical reasoning and semantic validation.

Method: The system performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations, converting meteorological inputs into narratives and generating summarizing keywords.

Result: Demonstrated improved interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather reports using OpenWeather and Meteostat data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reproducible method for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advances agent-based scientific reasoning.

Abstract: We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.

### [481] [Towards Continuous Intelligence Growth: Self-Training, Continual Learning, and Dual-Scale Memory in SuperIntelliAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23436)

TL;DR: SuperIntelliAgent is a self-supervised learning framework combining a trainable diffusion model and a frozen LLM for continual intelligence growth. It uses verifier-guided feedback and memory mechanisms to optimize learning without annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enable autonomous, continual intelligence growth without reliance on annotated data by leveraging self-supervised interaction between a learner and a verifier.

Method: The framework pairs a trainable diffusion model (learner) with a frozen LLM (verifier). The learner generates outputs, the verifier evaluates them, and their interaction produces DPO pairs for optimization. Dual-scale memory (short-term and long-term) and a replay buffer enhance learning.

Result: SuperIntelliAgent improves performance across benchmarks using minimal DPO pairs, demonstrating effective continual intelligence accumulation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a viable approach for lifelong learning and real-world deployment by combining trainable learners with reasoning-capable verifiers.

Abstract: We introduce SuperIntelliAgent, an agentic learning framework that couples a trainable small diffusion model (the learner) with a frozen large language model (the verifier) to enable continual intelligence growth through self-supervised interaction. Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

TL;DR: WMAct is a method for LLMs to enhance world model reasoning by reducing redundancy and optimizing interaction frequency, improving task resolution in fewer turns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rigid reasoning processes hinder LLMs' active learning and efficient world model reasoning in complex environments.

Method: WMAct uses reward rescaling and interaction frequency annealing to internalize world models, promoting purposeful interaction and condensed learning.

Result: Experiments show WMAct resolves tasks faster and improves transferability to complex environments.

Conclusion: WMAct enhances LLM agents' world model reasoning efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.
