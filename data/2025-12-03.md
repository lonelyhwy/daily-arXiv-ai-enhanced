### [1] [Leveraging AI multimodal geospatial foundation models for improved near-real-time flood mapping at a global scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02055)
*Mirela G. Tulbure,Julio Caineta,Mark Broich,Mollie D. Gaines,Philippe Rufin,Leon-Friedrich Thomas,Hamed Alemohammad,Jan Hemmerling,Patrick Hostert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) for flood mapping using multimodal data, finding that fine-tuning ESA-IBM’s TerraMind improves performance but still has limitations compared to U-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floods are highly destructive, but current flood mapping methods rely on labeled datasets and lack generalizability. This study aims to assess GFMs' effectiveness for global flood events.

Method: The authors fine-tuned TerraMind using FloodsNet, a dataset with Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 floods, testing four model configurations and comparing against Sen1Floods11 and U-Net benchmarks.

Result: The base-unfrozen model balanced accuracy and computational cost best, while the large unfrozen model had the highest recall. FloodsNet-trained models outperformed Sen1Floods11 in recall, though U-Net had higher recall overall.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning GFMs with multimodal data improves flood mapping, but challenges remain. The study highlights GFMs' potential and limitations for disaster resilience.

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [2] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a context-enriched contrastive loss function to address information distortion in contrastive learning, improving efficiency and performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning suffers from information distortion due to overreliance on samples with identical labels and neglect of positive pairs from the same image. The proposed loss aims to mitigate this issue.

Method: The context-enriched contrastive loss includes two components: one sensitive to label contrast and another that aligns augmented samples from the same source image.

Result: The method outperforms 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning techniques on 8 benchmark datasets, showing a 22.9% improvement on BiasedMNIST.

Conclusion: The proposed loss function enhances generalization, convergence speed, and fairness in downstream tasks, making it a promising advancement in contrastive learning.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [3] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured method to evaluate text-to-image (T2I) models and vision language models (VLMs) by testing VLMs' ability to identify specific failure modes in T2I-generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models often inaccurately capture user prompts, and existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate VLMs. This gap necessitates a hierarchical evaluation framework.

Method: The authors create a dataset of prompts and images from 5 T2I models, annotated by VLMs using an LLM, to test VLM identification of 27 failure modes.

Result: Analysis reveals systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation, showing current metrics inadequately capture these errors.

Conclusion: Targeted benchmarks are crucial for improving generative model reliability and interpretability, as current metrics fall short.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [4] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LLOST, a deep latent variable model using dual variational autoencoders and a shared latent space to link medical images and genetic mutations for cancer diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early cancer diagnosis and treatment efficacy rely on integrating medical imaging and genetic data, prompting the development of LLOST.

Method: LLOST uses point cloud representations of lesions and dual variational autoencoders with a shared latent space, incorporating conditional normalizing flow priors.

Result: The model achieves accurate prediction of somatic mutations and identifies shared patterns between imaging and mutation domains.

Conclusion: Future work includes improving the model and expanding it to other genetic domains.

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [5] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSuRe selectively applies super-resolution (SR) content to undersampled regions in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enhance render quality without introducing inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SR methods uniformly enhance all images, causing multi-view inconsistencies and blurry renders. The paper aims to leverage camera poses and scene geometry to selectively apply SR only where needed.

Method: SplatSuRe uses camera pose and scene geometry to identify undersampled regions lacking high-frequency details, selectively applying SR content there instead of uniformly across all images.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in fidelity and perceptual quality on datasets like Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF 360, especially in foreground regions.

Conclusion: Selective SR application based on scene geometry and camera pose yields sharper, more consistent results compared to uniform SR methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [6] [RobustSurg: Tackling domain generalisation for out-of-distribution surgical scene segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02188)
*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSurg improves surgical scene segmentation by leveraging style and content information, using instance normalization and feature covariance mapping, and introducing a restitution module. It shows significant performance gains on unseen datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of generalizability in surgical scene segmentation across different centers and imaging modalities, inspired by natural scene methods.

Method: Utilizes instance normalization and feature covariance mapping for robust features, with a restitution module in ResNet to retain task-relevant features. Introduces a new dataset for multiclass, multicentre evaluation.

Result: Achieves up to 23% improvement over baseline and 10-32% over SOTA on unseen datasets (HeiCholSeg and EndoUDA polyp datasets).

Conclusion: RobustSurg enhances generalizability in surgical scene segmentation, outperforming existing methods on diverse datasets.

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

### [7] [Multifractal Recalibration of Neural Networks for Medical Imaging Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02198)
*Miguel L. Martins,Miguel T. Coimbra,Francesco Renna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces multifractal recalibration methods for deep learning, showing gains in semantic segmentation tasks and validating them on medical-imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multifractal methods in deep learning suffer from limitations like heavy pooling or feature-space decimation, prompting the development of Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration.

Method: The paper introduces inductive priors leveraging relationships between probability mass of exponents and the multifractal spectrum, implemented as channel-attention functions in U-Net frameworks.

Result: Multifractal recalibration outperforms baselines with other channel-attention mechanisms, validated on ISIC18, Kvasir-SEG, and BUSI datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides insights into attention layer behavior, showing excitation responses don't specialize with depth due to skip connections and relate to global instance variability statistics.

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [8] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified-VQA is a framework addressing limitations in current video quality assessment by using a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts approach, providing interpretable feedback and superior performance across diverse video formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA models lack interpretability and generality, being specialized and monolithic. Unified-VQA aims to offer diagnostic, actionable insights and a unified solution for diverse distortions.

Method: Proposes Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with perceptual experts for distinct domains, multi-proxy expert training, and a diagnostic multi-task head for global scores and artifact vectors.

Result: Outperforms 18 benchmarks in generic VQA and artifact detection across 17 databases, handling HD, UHD, HDR, and HFR formats without retraining.

Conclusion: Unified-VQA advances practical, interpretable video quality assessment with a unified, scalable framework.

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

### [9] [See, Hear, and Understand: Benchmarking Audiovisual Human Speech Understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02231)
*Le Thien Phuc Nguyen,Zhuoran Yu,Samuel Low Yu Hang,Subin An,Jeongik Lee,Yohan Ban,SeungEun Chung,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,JuWan Maeng,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench is a new benchmark assessing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in MLLMs, focusing on speaker-centric analysis in videos. Gemini models lead performance, highlighting gaps in open-source alternatives like Qwen3-Omni-30B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks inadequately evaluate fine-grained reasoning about human speech, failing to align who speaks, what is said, and timing. AV-SpeakerBench addresses this gap.

Method: AV-SpeakerBench includes 3,212 multiple-choice questions with speaker-centered reasoning, fusion-grounded question design, and expert-curated annotations for temporal precision and cross-modal validity.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforms open-source models, with Qwen3-Omni-30B trailing due to weaker audiovisual fusion. The benchmark provides detailed insights into model capabilities.

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench sets a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in multimodal systems, revealing performance disparities between proprietary and open-source models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

### [10] [Exploring the Potentials of Spiking Neural Networks for Image Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02258)
*Shuang Chen,Tomas Krajnik,Farshad Arvin,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNNs are explored for low-level vision tasks like image deraining, introducing VLIF neurons and modules to enhance performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-exploration of SNNs in low-level vision tasks and overcome limitations like spatial context misunderstanding and frequency-domain saturation.

Method: Proposes VLIF neurons, Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module, and Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical learning.

Result: Outperforms SNN-based deraining methods on five datasets with 13% energy consumption.

Conclusion: Demonstrates SNNs' potential for high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

### [11] [Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flow Matching for Climate Emulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02268)
*Jeremy Andrew Irvin,Jiaqi Han,Zikui Wang,Abdulaziz Alharbi,Yufei Zhao,Nomin-Erdene Bayarsaikhan,Daniele Visioni,Andrew Y. Ng,Duncan Watson-Parris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPF introduces a hierarchical flow matching approach for efficient, parallel climate emulation across spatial and temporal scales, outperforming baselines and enabling probabilistic climate modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of slow and unstable autoregressive methods in climate emulation under nonstationary forcings.

Method: Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF) partitions generative trajectories hierarchically, conditioning stages on physical forcings for multi-scale sampling.

Result: SPF beats flow matching baselines on ClimateBench, scales with ClimateSuite, and generalizes well to new scenarios.

Conclusion: SPF and ClimateSuite enable accurate, efficient climate emulation across scales and scenarios.

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Repurposing CogVideo for progressive image restoration via temporal progression, achieving improved perceptual metrics and zero-shot robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the underexplored potential of text-to-video models for image restoration tasks.

Method: Fine-tune CogVideo to generate restoration trajectories using synthetic datasets and compare uniform vs. scene-specific prompting.

Result: Improved PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames, with generalization to real-world datasets like ReLoBlur without training.

Conclusion: CogVideo effectively performs progressive image restoration with temporal coherence and zero-shot robustness.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

### [13] [Enhancing Cross Domain SAR Oil Spill Segmentation via Morphological Region Perturbation and Synthetic Label-to-SAR Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02290)
*Andre Juarez,Luis Salsavilca,Frida Coaquira,Celso Gonzales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORP-Synth is a synthetic augmentation framework that improves SAR oil spill segmentation models' transferability from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions, addressing generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR oil spill segmentation models struggle with generalization across regions due to varying sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, especially where labeled data is scarce.

Method: MORP-Synth uses a two-stage approach: Stage A applies Morphological Region Perturbation for geometric variations, and Stage B renders SAR-like textures using a conditional generative INADE model.

Result: Pretrained models degrade from 67.8% to 51.8% mIoU on Peruvian data; MORP-Synth improves performance by up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Conclusion: MORP-Synth effectively enhances model transferability and performance in regions with scarce labeled data, like the Peruvian coast.

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

*Chenshuang Zhang,Kang Zhang,Joon Son Chung,In So Kweon,Junmo Kim,Chengzhi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised tracker using pre-trained video diffusion models improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects by leveraging inherent motion representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of tracking visually similar objects where contemporary self-supervised trackers fail due to ambiguous visual cues and lack of labeled data.

Method: Utilizes pre-trained video diffusion models, which inherently learn motion representations during the denoising process, to enable robust tracking without task-specific training.

Result: Achieves a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised methods on benchmarks, especially in tracking visually similar items.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that diffusion-derived motion representations enhance tracking robustness, even for identical objects under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Motivation: Existing methods struggle with maintaining temporal consistency in online settings due to limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness.

Method: A Thin Plate Spline (TPS)-based framework with globally propagated control points and point-agnostic submap registration for noisy geometry robustness.

Result: Consistent improvements in geometry coherence and trajectory accuracy across diverse datasets, models, and camera setups.

Conclusion: The proposed method is versatile, robust, and plug-and-play, enhancing temporal alignment for 3D vision foundation models.

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

*Siyuan Sun,Yongping Zhang,Hongcheng Zeng,Yamin Wang,Wei Yang,Wanting Yang,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-CAM enhances CNN interpretability for SAR tasks by visualizing decision bases through multi-weight self-matching, improving localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs lack interpretability in SAR tasks, limiting their reliability and application.

Method: Proposes MS-CAM, combining channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize CNN decisions.

Result: MS-CAM accurately highlights regions of interest and improves SAR target classification and localization.

Conclusion: MS-CAM advances CNN interpretability and applicability in SAR, with potential for weakly-supervised localization.

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

*Shwai He,Chaorui Deng,Ang Li,Shen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores inefficiencies in unified multimodal models, revealing that understanding components are compressible while generation components are sensitive to pruning. It proposes Mixture-of-Experts Adaptation to improve efficiency, achieving performance comparable to the full model with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in unified multimodal models, where full model capacity isn't always required for specific tasks or samples, and to systematically understand these inefficiencies.

Method: Conducted systematic analysis using training-free pruning (depth and width). Proposed Mixture-of-Experts Adaptation for generation modules, enabling sparse activation.

Result: Understanding components are compressible; generation components degrade sharply with pruning. MoE Adaptation restores generation quality, achieving full-model performance with ~50% parameter activation.

Conclusion: The MoE Adaptation effectively addresses inefficiencies in unified multimodal models, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

*Bin Li,Daijie Chen,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC) is introduced, leveraging count supervision and self-supervised ranking loss for improved accuracy without costly annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs of crowd annotations and camera calibrations in existing multi-view crowd counting methods, the paper proposes a more practical, weakly-supervised solution.

Method: The method uses crowd count supervision instead of density maps, incorporates self-supervised ranking loss with multi-scale priors, and leverages semantic information for view matching.

Result: WSCF-MVCC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets under weakly supervised settings, demonstrating higher accuracy and practicality.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a cost-effective and accurate solution for multi-view crowd counting, suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

TL;DR: VACoT enhances VLMs' robustness by dynamically applying image augmentations during inference, improving performance on challenging tasks without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual language models (VLMs) rely heavily on large-scale data or synthetic diversity, often struggling with basic tasks. Traditional augmentation methods yield diminishing returns due to high pre-training costs.

Method: Introduces Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes post-hoc image augmentations (e.g., denoising) during inference. It uses conditional rewards to balance augmentation necessity and response conciseness.

Result: VACoT significantly improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in adversarial OCR scenarios, outperforming on 13 perception benchmarks.

Conclusion: VACoT offers a cost-effective solution for enhancing VLMs' robustness by integrating post-hoc visual augmentations, reducing training complexity and computational overhead.

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TB diagnosis remains challenging, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods are inefficient, prompting exploration of ML models to improve detection.

Method: Used Kaggle dataset (4,200 X-rays), ResNet-50 and SqueezeNet models, with preprocessing (augmentation, resizing). Evaluated via accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

Result: SqueezeNet: 89% accuracy, 98% precision, 80% recall, 87% F1. ResNet-50: 73% accuracy, 88% precision, 52% recall, 65% F1.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows promise for TB detection, but further development is needed for faster, smaller, and more accurate models.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with redundant data and inefficiency in extracting scene information, especially in complex agent interactions, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: Proposes a novel algorithm combining MoE for adaptive frequency component selection, selective attention for filtering redundant data, and a multimodal decoder supervised by patch- and point-level losses.

Result: Experiments on Nuscences datasets show the algorithm's superiority in handling complex interactive scenarios effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed map-free algorithm enhances trajectory prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in challenging interactive environments.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

*Qingmei Li,Yang Zhang,Peifeng Zhang,Haohuan Fu,Juepeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE is a style-adaptive generalization framework that enhances semantic segmentation models' performance under domain shifts without modifying model weights, using dynamic visual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation due to domain shifts without accessing model parameters or architectural details, preserving privacy and security.

Method: Uses style transfer to create diverse style representations and adaptively fuses them into dynamic prompts to align feature distributions.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on five benchmarks without modifying model weights, outperforming full fine-tuning baselines.

Conclusion: SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen models and unseen domains, offering a privacy-preserving solution for domain generalization.

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces On-the-fly Feedback SfM, a real-time UAV photogrammetry framework integrating exploration, exploitation, and feedback to improve 3D reconstruction quality and reduce re-flight costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time UAV photogrammetry is crucial for time-sensitive applications like disaster response, but existing methods lack quality evaluation and guided feedback during acquisition.

Method: The framework includes online coarse-mesh generation, mesh quality assessment, and predictive path planning to refine trajectories dynamically.

Result: Experiments show near real-time reconstruction with actionable feedback, reducing coverage gaps and re-flight costs.

Conclusion: The method enables intelligent, adaptive workflows, transitioning from passive to active UAV photogrammetry.

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDTA improves multi-object tracking by refining object embeddings for better instance-level distinction across frames, using spatial, temporal, and identity adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end MOT methods lack association accuracy due to high inter-object similarity in embeddings, failing to distinguish instances across frames.

Method: FDTA introduces Spatial Adapter (SA), Temporal Adapter (TA), and Identity Adapter (IA) to enhance embeddings for spatial continuity, temporal dependencies, and instance-level separability.

Result: FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on MOT benchmarks like DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT.

Conclusion: FDTA's feature refinement framework effectively enhances tracking accuracy by addressing embedding discriminativeness.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline for 4D radar semantic segmentation, improving accuracy without human annotations and addressing the lack of open datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radar semantic segmentation lacks open datasets and reproducible methods, hindering progress. The RaDelft dataset lacks radar labels and public code.

Method: A camera-guided pipeline projects radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation, applies spatial clustering, and generates accurate radar labels.

Result: The method enhances radar label accuracy and provides a reproducible framework for training and evaluating labeled 4D radar data. It also quantifies fog impact on labeling.

Conclusion: The pipeline addresses dataset scarcity and reproducibility challenges, enabling better radar semantic segmentation research.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in multimodal agentic systems, which treat image manipulation and web search separately, rely on costly RL, and lack grounded planning.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning on <30K high-quality trajectories with stepwise consistency filtering, unifying multimodal planning, active image manipulation, deep multimodal search, and interleaved reasoning.

Result: Achieves SOTA scores (66.1 on MMSearch, 67.2 on FVQA), surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics, and exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning (>10 tool calls).

Conclusion: Sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved via curated supervised learning alone, eliminating the need for reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-vocabulary object-goal navigation suffer from unclear decision-making and low success rates on novel objects.

Method: Nav-R^2 explicitly models target-environment and environment-action relationships using CoT reasoning and SA-Mem, which compresses video frames and fuses historical observations.

Result: Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects, avoids overfitting to seen categories, and operates at 2Hz.

Conclusion: Nav-R^2 provides an efficient and transparent solution for open-vocabulary object-goal navigation, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

TL;DR: MitUNet, a hybrid neural network combining a Mix-Transformer encoder and U-Net decoder with scSE attention, improves wall segmentation for 3D reconstruction by addressing thin structure detection and boundary precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in detecting thin structural elements and producing geometrically precise masks needed for 3D reconstruction.

Method: MitUNet uses a Mix-Transformer encoder for global context and a U-Net decoder with scSE attention for boundary recovery, optimized via Tversky loss.

Result: Outperforms standard models on CubiCasa5k and proprietary datasets, generating accurate masks for 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: MitUNet enhances wall segmentation precision, aiding automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

*Xinyao Li,Yinjie Min,Hongbo Chen,Zhekai Du,Fengling Li,Jingjing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) balances domain specificity and generalization (DG). Current methods may hinder DG by adapting a universal model. The paper theorizes that training domain-specific experts improves DG and introduces GuiDG, a two-step framework combining prompt tuning and cross-modal attention for adaptive expert integration. Results show GuiDG outperforms existing methods efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between domain specificity and generalization in fine-tuning VLMs motivates exploring better DG methods, as current universal model approaches may limit unseen domain performance.

Method: Proposes GuiDG: 1) trains domain experts via prompt tuning on partitioned source domains, 2) uses Cross-Modal Attention to adaptively integrate experts for vision encoder fine-tuning. Introduces ImageNet-DG for few-shot DG evaluation.

Result: GuiDG outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG, maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Training domain-specific experts and adaptive integration via GuiDG enhances DG performance efficiently, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Method: The authors propose GUI Exploration Lab, enabling screen and navigation graph definition. They use supervised fine-tuning followed by single-turn and multi-turn reinforcement learning to enhance agent capabilities.

Result: Experiments show supervised fine-tuning aids memorization, while reinforcement learning improves generalization and exploration strategies, boosting navigation performance.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning enhances GUI navigation, and the findings offer practical guidance for developing more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

*Woongyeong Yeo,Kangsan Kim,Jaehong Yoon,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldMM introduces a multimodal memory agent to enhance long video understanding by utilizing episodic, semantic, and visual memories with adaptive retrieval, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video large language models struggle with long videos due to limited context capacity and reliance on textual summaries, missing crucial visual details.

Method: WorldMM employs episodic, semantic, and visual memories, along with an adaptive retrieval agent to dynamically select relevant memory sources.

Result: WorldMM achieves an average 8.4% performance gain over state-of-the-art methods on five long video question-answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: WorldMM effectively addresses limitations in long video reasoning by leveraging multimodal memories and adaptive retrieval.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

*Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LightHCG, a lightweight AI model for glaucoma detection, addressing limitations of current methods like reliability and excessive parameters by focusing on causal relationships among glaucoma factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven glaucoma detection lacks reliability, uses excessive parameters, and has limitations in clinical applications. The paper aims to improve these aspects.

Method: Proposes LightHCG, a Convolutional VAE-based model using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder for unsupervised causal representation learning.

Result: LightHCG achieves high glaucoma classification performance with 93~99% fewer weights and enables better AI-driven intervention analysis.

Conclusion: LightHCG outperforms existing models by focusing on true causality, offering lightweight, reliable glaucoma detection with clinical potential.

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining momentum-based distillation with gradient accumulation to improve training efficiency and performance of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare, achieving competitive results with single-GPU training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of limited annotated data and high computational demands in healthcare VLMs by focusing on knowledge extraction and efficiency.

Method: Leverages momentum self-distillation and integrates momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enhance multimodal learning without increasing resource consumption.

Result: Achieves over 90% AUC-ROC in few-shot adaptation, improves retrieval tasks by 2-3%, and maintains high training efficiency with a single GPU.

Conclusion: The approach advances efficient multimodal learning by balancing performance and resource efficiency, outperforming SOTA methods.

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods.

TL;DR: BOLT is a framework for reusing fine-tuned models by extracting task-informed spectral bases, enabling efficient adaptation to new tasks with minimal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks with limited data and compute resources, avoiding costly meta-learning phases.

Method: BOLT extracts orthogonal spectral bases from existing models, freezes them, and trains minimal diagonal coefficients for new tasks.

Result: BOLT provides robust performance comparable to meta-learned initializations and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: Constraining adaptation to task-informed orthogonal subspaces offers an effective solution for transferring models to new tasks.

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

*Fan Luo,Zeyu Gao,Xinhao Luo,Kai Zhao,Yanfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) improves Spiking Neural Networks' temporal modeling by using diverse stimuli and energy-efficient attention, outperforming existing methods in object detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SNNs lack diverse temporal stimuli, limiting their expressive power, especially in complex tasks like object detection.

Method: TDE includes a Spiking Encoder (SE) for diverse stimuli and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) guided by temporal dependencies, with Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) reducing energy use.

Result: TDE achieves mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on PASCAL VOC and 47.6% on EvDET200K, with SDA using only 24% of conventional attention energy.

Conclusion: TDE enhances SNNs' temporal modeling and energy efficiency, proving superior in performance and practicality.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an in-depth analysis of the nuScenes dataset, its significance in AV development, and its influence on subsequent datasets and standards in the field.

Method: The work examines the creation, extensions (nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes), and technical details of nuScenes, alongside its impact on other datasets and community standards.

Result: The paper reveals unpublished technical details about nuScenes, traces its influence on later datasets, and reviews methodologies developed using it, offering a comprehensive survey of AV literature focused on nuScenes.

Conclusion: nuScenes remains a foundational dataset in AV research, setting standards and inspiring subsequent datasets and methodologies, with its detailed examination providing valuable insights for the community.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HouseLayout3D introduces a real-world benchmark for full-building-scale 3D layout estimation, addressing gaps in current models that struggle with multi-floor buildings. MultiFloor3D, a training-free baseline, outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D layout estimation models lack the ability to handle multi-floor buildings due to training on synthetic single-room datasets. This limits their practical application in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose HouseLayout3D, a real-world benchmark for multi-floor buildings, and MultiFloor3D, a training-free baseline leveraging recent scene understanding techniques.

Result: MultiFloor3D outperforms existing models on both the new benchmark and prior datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for advancements in 3D layout estimation for multi-floor buildings and provides a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STL is a self-training framework enhancing VLMs by combining visual attribute extraction and reasoning, outperforming baselines with minimal reliance on high-quality CoT data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with balancing perception and reasoning, relying on costly CoT data. STL aims to address this gap.

Method: STL uses a structured reasoning template ('See-Think-Learn'), self-generated rationales, and negative rationales for robust learning.

Result: STL outperforms baselines across domains, with qualitative analysis showing high-quality rationales.

Conclusion: STL provides a cost-effective way to improve multimodal reasoning in VLMs without heavy reliance on annotated data.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

*Jianzong Wu,Hao Lian,Dachao Hao,Ye Tian,Qingyu Shi,Biaolong Chen,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint audio-video denoising improves video generation quality by leveraging causal relationships between visual and acoustic events, beyond just synchrony.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if audio-video joint denoising enhances video generation quality independently of audio synchronization.

Method: Introduces AVFullDiT, a parameter-efficient architecture using pre-trained T2V and T2A modules for joint denoising, comparing T2AV and T2V-only models under identical conditions.

Result: Audio-video joint denoising consistently improves video quality, especially in challenging scenarios with dynamic motions, suggesting audio acts as a privileged signal for video dynamics.

Conclusion: Cross-modal co-training enhances video generation by internalizing causal relationships between visual and acoustic events, offering a pathway to more physically grounded models.

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper addresses sequential embodied tasks in AI, introducing SEER-Bench for evaluation and proposing 3DSPMR, a method leveraging spatial memory for improved reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents in real-life sequential tasks face challenges like reusing spatial knowledge and handling infeasible sub-tasks, which existing single-task setups fail to address.

Method: Introduces SEER-Bench for benchmarking sequential tasks (EQA and EMN) and proposes 3DSPMR, a method combining relational, visual, and geometric cues with MLLMs.

Result: 3DSPMR significantly improves performance on sequential EQA and EMN tasks, demonstrating the value of incorporating geometric information.

Conclusion: The work advances embodied AI by addressing sequential task challenges and integrating geometric cues into MLLMs, verified through SEER-Bench.

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

TL;DR: TGDD improves dataset distillation by dynamically aligning feature distributions along the training trajectory, enhancing semantic diversity and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distribution matching methods overlook evolving feature representations during training, limiting synthetic data expressiveness and downstream performance.

Method: TGDD reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process, capturing evolving semantics and reducing class overlap with a regularization term.

Result: TGDD achieves a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across ten datasets.

Conclusion: TGDD balances performance and efficiency, improving semantic diversity and representativeness in synthetic data without extra optimization overhead.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

Motivation: Addressing the unresolved challenge of temporally- and spatially-consistent long-term world modeling in video world models, which is hindered by high computational costs for long-context inputs.

Method: WorldPack employs trajectory packing for high context efficiency and memory retrieval to maintain consistency in rollouts and aid spatial reasoning in long-term generations.

Result: WorldPack significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation, notably outperforming strong state-of-the-art models on the LoopNav benchmark in Minecraft.

Conclusion: WorldPack demonstrates a scalable solution for long-term world modeling in videos, achieving superior performance despite shorter context lengths.

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability.

Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reasoning detachment in VLMs for medical diagnosis, where explanations drift from image evidence, undermining trust. Existing multi-agent frameworks amplify noise and fail to anchor reasoning to visuals.

Method: UCAgents uses hierarchical multi-agents inspired by clinical workflows, enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. It includes one-round inquiry to detect visual-textual misalignment.

Result: Achieves 71.3% accuracy on PathVQA (+6.0% over SOTA) with 87.7% lower token cost, balancing visual evidence extraction and textual noise reduction.

Conclusion: UCAgents offers diagnostic reliability and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

Method: ReVSeg breaks reasoning into three operations—semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding—using VLMs. Reinforcement learning optimizes the reasoning chain.

Result: ReVSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and provides interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: Explicit decomposition and reinforcement learning enhance reasoning in video object segmentation, making ReVSeg both effective and interpretable.

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

### [46] [Masking Matters: Unlocking the Spatial Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs for 3D Scene-Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02487)
*Yerim Jeon,Miso Lee,WonJun Moon,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-SLIM, a masking strategy for 3D scene-language understanding that replaces causal masks with adaptive attention masks tailored to spatial structures, improving performance without altering model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use causal attention masks in LLMs, which conflict with order-agnostic 3D objects and restrict object-instruction attention, limiting task-specific reasoning in 3D scenes.

Method: 3D-SLIM replaces causal masks with adaptive masks: a Geometry-adaptive Mask based on spatial density and an Instruction-aware Mask allowing direct object-instruction context access.

Result: Experiments show 3D-SLIM significantly improves performance in 3D scene-language tasks without adding parameters or modifying architecture.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning, showcasing 3D-SLIM's effectiveness across benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

*Jiahui Chen,Weida Wang,Runhua Shi,Huan Yang,Chaofan Ding,Zihao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YingVideo-MV is a cascaded framework for generating music-driven long-videos, integrating audio analysis, shot planning, diffusion models, and camera motion control to produce coherent and expressive videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack explicit camera motion control and struggle with generating music-performance videos with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency.

Method: The framework combines audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, long-sequence consistency modeling, and a camera adapter module for embedding camera poses.

Result: YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating high-quality, coherent music videos with precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses gaps in long-video generation, particularly for music-performance videos, by integrating innovative modules for camera motion and continuity.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

*Mizuki Kikkawa,Tatsuya Yatagawa,Yutaka Ohtake,Hiromasa Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines issues with deep-learning-based partial-to-partial point set registration methods, focusing on DeepGMR's limitations. It proposes an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer to improve transformation-invariant feature extraction, enhancing performance for DeepGMR and UGMMReg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address theoretical and practical problems in deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, especially DeepGMR's limitations in partial-to-partial point set registration.

Method: Introduces an ARPS layer that uses attention modules to robustly identify common reference points, ensuring transformation-invariant features.

Result: The ARPS layer significantly improves DeepGMR and UGMMReg, outperforming prior deep learning methods focused on overlap regions or reference points.

Conclusion: The study offers valuable insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs, demonstrating ARPS's effectiveness in enhancing performance.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

*Yuan Xiong,Ziqi Miao,Lijun Li,Chen Qian,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIA introduces an image-centric jailbreak attack for MLLMs, outperforming text-focused methods by embedding harmful queries into benign visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks underutilize images' potential for complex, contextual information in jailbreaking MLLMs.

Method: CIA employs a multi-agent system with visualization strategies, contextual enhancement, and toxicity obfuscation.

Result: Achieves high toxicity scores (4.73, 4.83) and ASRs (86.31%, 91.07%) on GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B.

Conclusion: Visual modality is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

TL;DR: MedSeg-TTA is a benchmark evaluating 20 adaptation methods across 7 medical imaging modalities, revealing no single best method and emphasizing the need for principled selection for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current evaluations of test-time adaptation (TTA) for medical image segmentation, including inadequate modality coverage and methodological inconsistency.

Method: The study examines 20 TTA methods across MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, unified under standardized preprocessing and protocols. Four adaptation paradigms are tested: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation.

Result: No single paradigm excels universally. Input-level methods are stable for mild shifts, Feature/Output-level methods excel in boundary metrics, and Prior Estimation methods are modality-dependent. Some methods falter under large shifts, stressing careful clinical selection.

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA offers standardized datasets, implementations, and a leaderboard, advancing robust TTA research for clinical reliability. Source code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: dots.ocr's unified approach sets a new benchmark for document intelligence, demonstrating the advantages of joint learning and scalable data synthesis.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training.

This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

TL;DR: GeoDiT, a diffusion-based model, outperforms autoregressive models in geospatial tasks by aligning generation with data structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are misaligned with geospatial understanding, hindering structured outputs.

Method: Introduces GeoDiT, a diffusion-based model for parallel refinement in geospatial generation.

Result: GeoDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection.

Conclusion: Aligning generative processes with intrinsic data structure improves geospatial analysis.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

TL;DR: ViT-SR introduces a two-stage training strategy combining self-supervised pre-training and residual learning for improved SISR performance on DIV2K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) remains challenging, motivating the development of ViT-SR to enhance Vision Transformer performance for this task.

Method: Uses a two-stage approach: self-supervised pre-training on colourization followed by fine-tuning for 4x super-resolution, utilizing residual learning.

Result: Achieves SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB on DIV2K, demonstrating the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method shows promise, with potential for further gains using larger ViT models or different pretext tasks.

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision-language models are inefficient for remote sensing tasks, lacking the ability to differentiate task types and interpretation granularities.

Method: SkyMoE uses an adaptive router and specialized experts, plus a context-disentangled augmentation strategy for level-specific learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 21 datasets, showing superior adaptability and multi-granularity understanding.

Conclusion: SkyMoE enhances remote sensing interpretation by balancing local and global features effectively.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

TL;DR: This dissertation explores zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) challenges and solutions, focusing on consistent anomalies and leveraging pre-trained Vision Transformers and graph-based frameworks like CoDeGraph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for zero-shot anomaly detection in industrial inspection and medical imaging, particularly for consistent anomalies that bias distance-based methods.

Method: Analyzes patch representations from Vision Transformers, introduces CoDeGraph for anomaly filtering, extends to 3D medical imaging, and integrates text-based zero-shot methods.

Result: Demonstrates effective suppression of consistent anomalies and proposes a zero-shot pipeline for 3D anomaly detection without training data.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights and practical frameworks for zero-shot AC/AS, bridging gaps between batch-based and text-based methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses task generalization collapse in MLLMs when bridging VLMs and Diffusion Models.

Method: Introduces Noisy Query Tokens for distributed representation and a VAE branch for fine-grained detail recovery.

Result: Mitigates generalization collapse and supports stable continual learning across tasks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges VLMs and Diffusion Models while improving adaptability.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes global self-attention in VGGT and $π^3$, revealing distinct roles in multi-view reasoning, and introduces a training-free acceleration scheme achieving significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of global self-attention in models like VGGT and $π^3$ and understand its contribution to multi-view reasoning.

Method: Conducts an in-depth analysis of global attention modules, proposes converting early layers to frame attention and subsampling global attention with diagonal preservation and mean-fill.

Result: Achieves 8-10× speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving accuracy, robust in dense multi-view settings.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free acceleration scheme effectively reduces computation without compromising performance, offering insights into global attention's role.

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of large-scale high-quality training data in ReID due to privacy and annotation challenges, overcoming limitations of previous pedestrian generation methods in identity consistency and controllability.

Method: Introduces OmniPerson, a unified generation model with Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation and PersonSyn dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in pedestrian generation, enhancing ReID model performance through dataset augmentation.

Conclusion: OmniPerson provides a scalable solution for high-fidelity pedestrian generation and dataset augmentation, with open-source release planned.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

TL;DR: Panel2Patch introduces a hierarchical data pipeline for biomedical vision-language models, extracting fine-grained alignments from scientific figures and text to improve representation learning with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biomedical vision-language pretraining lacks fine-grained correspondences crucial for clinical applications.

Method: Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and markers from figures and captions, creating multi-granular vision-language pairs for pretraining.

Result: The method extracts more effective supervision than prior pipelines, leading to better performance with reduced pretraining data.

Conclusion: Panel2Patch enhances biomedical vision-language models by preserving local semantics and leveraging hierarchical structure.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using a diffusion model and motion-based retrieval improves synchronization and naturalness in co-speech gesture video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of one-to-one mapping in audio-gesture synthesis by addressing the many-to-many nature of the relationship.

Method: Use a diffusion model to generate gestures from audio, enrich training with multi-level audio features, and refine output with motion-based retrieval and stitching.

Result: Significant improvement in synchronization accuracy and gesture naturalness compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of co-speech gesture synthesis, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

### [61] [Content-Aware Texturing for Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02621)
*Panagiotis Papantonakis,Georgios Kopanas,Fredo Durand,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using adaptive texture mapping within Gaussian Splatting to improve efficiency in representing fine appearance details, reducing the need for excessive Gaussian primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine appearance details in scenes represented by Gaussian Splatting often require many small Gaussian primitives, which can be inefficient when geometry and appearance have different frequency characteristics.

Method: The authors introduce per-primitive texture maps that adapt dynamically during optimization, with texture resolution scaled based on image sampling frequency and content.

Result: The method achieves better image quality and uses fewer parameters compared to alternative textured Gaussian primitive solutions.

Conclusion: Incorporating adaptive texture mapping into Gaussian Splatting optimizes efficiency and representation quality for detailed scenes.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RULER-Bench evaluates video generation models' reasoning abilities, focusing on rule-based cognitive tasks, revealing gaps despite visual quality advances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks prioritize visual and temporal aspects but neglect rule-based reasoning capabilities in video generation models.

Method: Introduces RULER-Bench with 40 tasks across six rule categories, using GPT-3 for automated scoring aligned with human judgments.

Result: State-of-the-art models score only 48.87% on rule coherence, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: RULER-Bench aims to advance reasoning-aware video generation, pushing models toward foundational vision intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

*Yongchuan Cui,Peng Liu,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pretraining strategy using simulated datasets to enhance generalization in remote sensing image fusion, achieving superior results across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address poor generalization in deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion due to limited real data and domain gaps.

Method: Constructs simulated datasets via degradations/augmentations, pretrains fusion models, and evaluates with zero-/one-shot paradigms.

Result: Pretraining improves generalization across sensors/conditions, excelling in zero-shot and adapting well with minimal real data.

Conclusion: Offers a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, setting a new benchmark and advancing foundation model use.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

*Junwon Lee,Juhan Nam,Jiyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SelVA is a novel text-conditioned V2A model that generates user-intended sounds from multi-object videos by leveraging text prompts as explicit selectors and modulating video features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate mixed sounds from videos, lacking precision in isolating specific audio sources due to entangled visual features and ineffective prompts.

Method: SelVA uses text prompts to modulate video encoder features, employs supplementary tokens for cross-attention, and includes a self-augmentation scheme for mono audio supervision.

Result: SelVA outperforms on audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization, as validated on the VGG-MONOAUDIO benchmark.

Conclusion: SelVA effectively addresses selective V2A generation, offering precise audio source extraction and robust performance.

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

### [66] [Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02660)
*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid architecture combining vision-language models (VLMs) and OCR for precise document retrieval, enhancing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by providing region-specific context without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs return entire pages, lacking precision for RAG, while OCR systems have structured text but lack semantic relevance. A hybrid solution is needed to combine their strengths.

Method: The approach uses ColPali's patch-level similarity scores to spatially filter OCR-extracted regions. It formalizes coordinate mapping between vision transformer patches and OCR boxes, introduces intersection metrics, and establishes theoretical retrieval bounds.

Result: The method operates at inference time without extra training. Snappy, an open-source implementation, demonstrates practical applicability, though empirical evaluation is ongoing.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture bridges the gap between VLMs and OCR, improving precision for RAG applications without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarGuide-GSDR integrates polarization and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve high-fidelity reflection separation and scene reconstruction without environment maps or restrictive assumptions, while maintaining real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in Polarization-aware NeRF and 3DGS, such as slow training, reflection-geometry entanglement, and environment map dependence.

Method: A bidirectional coupling mechanism leverages 3DGS's geometric priors to resolve polarization ambiguity, refining polarization cues to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis on public and self-collected datasets.

Conclusion: PolarGuide-GSDR is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, offering superior interpretability and real-time performance for reflective scenes.

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

TL;DR: UAUTrack is a unified single-target tracking framework integrating multiple modalities for Anti-UAV tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a text prior prompt strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Anti-UAV tracking lacks a unified cross-modal framework and struggles with multimodal data fusion, prompting the need for UAUTrack.

Method: UAUTrack uses a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture with a text prior prompt strategy to focus on UAVs across scenarios.

Result: UAUTrack achieves top performance on Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, balancing accuracy and speed on Anti-UAV410.

Conclusion: UAUTrack demonstrates high accuracy and practical efficiency, addressing gaps in cross-modal collaboration for Anti-UAV tracking.

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

*Zhongbao Yang,Jiangxin Dong,Yazhou Yao,Jinhui Tang,Jinshan Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGP-DiffSR is a lightweight diffusion method for efficient image super-resolution, reducing computational and memory costs by pruning redundant blocks and using phase-exchange adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale diffusion models for image super-resolution incur high computational and memory costs, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: PGP-DiffSR removes redundant blocks progressively and introduces a phase-exchange adapter module to leverage input phase information.

Result: The method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly lowering computational load and memory usage.

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR offers an efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models for image super-resolution without compromising performance.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

*Huankun Sheng,Ming Li,Yixiang Wei,Yeying Fan,Yu-Hui Wen,Tieliang Gong,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that separates foreground and background to improve object discovery. It uses dual-slot competition, clustering initialization, and pseudo-mask guidance to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slot attention methods treat foreground and background equally, leading to background interference and poor instance discovery. The paper aims to address this by explicitly modeling foreground and background separation.

Method: FASA employs a two-stage approach: coarse scene decomposition with dual-slot competition, followed by masked slot attention for precise object discovery. It uses clustering initialization and pseudo-mask guidance derived from self-supervised features.

Result: FASA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation.

Conclusion: Explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance significantly improve object discovery, making FASA a promising framework for unsupervised scene decomposition.

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat COVID-19 by ensuring adherence to WHO protocols (masks and 6-foot distance) using automated detection.

Method: Customized attention-InceptionV3 model trained on 10,800 images (masked/unmasked) achieves 98% training and 99.5% validation accuracy.

Result: System precision: 98.2%, FPS: 25. Identifies high-risk areas for virus spread.

Conclusion: The system aids authorities in locating risky zones swiftly, enabling timely precautions.

Abstract: One of the deadliest pandemics is now happening in the current world due to COVID-19. This contagious virus is spreading like wildfire around the whole world. To minimize the spreading of this virus, World Health Organization (WHO) has made protocols mandatory for wearing face masks and maintaining 6 feet physical distance. In this paper, we have developed a system that can detect the proper maintenance of that distance and people are properly using masks or not. We have used the customized attention-inceptionv3 model in this system for the identification of those two components. We have used two different datasets along with 10,800 images including both with and without Face Mask images. The training accuracy has been achieved 98% and validation accuracy 99.5%. The system can conduct a precision value of around 98.2% and the frame rate per second (FPS) was 25.0. So, with this system, we can identify high-risk areas with the highest possibility of the virus spreading zone. This may help authorities to take necessary steps to locate those risky areas and alert the local people to ensure proper precautions in no time.

*Yuxing Liu,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClimaDrive introduces a framework for generating diverse and realistic anomaly data for autonomous driving, improving anomaly segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack contextual coherence and realism in synthetic anomaly data, hindering model generalization in open-world environments.

Method: ClimaDrive combines structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting to create realistic OoD driving data.

Result: Training with ClimaOoD benchmark improves anomaly segmentation metrics (AUROC, AP, FPR95) across four methods.

Conclusion: ClimaOoD enhances model robustness and provides better training data for open-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

Conclusion: ALDI++ sets a new benchmark for domain-adaptive object detection in security X-ray imagery, demonstrating robust cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.

*Zixuan Song,Jing Zhang,Di Wang,Zidie Zhou,Wenbin Liu,Haonan Guo,En Wang,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoBridge is a foundation model designed for cross-view geo-localization, overcoming limitations of traditional satellite-centric methods by using semantic-anchor mechanisms and supporting language-to-image retrieval. It leverages the new GeoLoc dataset for improved accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geo-localization relies heavily on satellite imagery, which can be outdated or unavailable in high resolution. There's also untapped potential in combining multi-view and multi-modal data (e.g., drone, street-view, and language descriptions).

Method: GeoBridge introduces a semantic-anchor mechanism to bridge multi-view features via textual descriptions. It uses the GeoLoc dataset, which includes over 50,000 aligned drone, street-view, and satellite images with descriptions from 36 countries.

Result: Experiments show GeoLoc pre-training significantly boosts GeoBridge's geo-location accuracy, enhances cross-domain generalization, and facilitates cross-modal knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: GeoBridge offers a robust and flexible approach to geo-localization by leveraging multi-view and multi-modal data, supported by the comprehensive GeoLoc dataset. Resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

### [75] [VLM-Pruner: Buffering for Spatial Sparsity in an Efficient VLM Centrifugal Token Pruning Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02700)
*Zhenkai Wu,Xiaowen Ma,Zhenliang Ni,Dengming Zhang,Han Shu,Xin Jiang,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-Pruner is a training-free token pruning algorithm for vision-language models that balances redundancy and spatial sparsity, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods for VLMs often ignore inter-token redundancy and spatial relationships, leading to inefficient token retention and failure to cover target objects adequately.

Method: The proposed VLM-Pruner uses a centrifugal token pruning paradigm prioritizing fine-grained details, a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity criterion, and parallel greedy selection. It also fuses salient information from pruned tokens.

Result: VLM-Pruner achieves an 88.9% pruning rate and outperforms baselines across five VLMs while improving inference speed.

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner effectively addresses redundancy and spatial sparsity in token pruning, enhancing efficiency and performance for VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

TL;DR: Proposed a sex-stratified whole-body MR image registration method using tissue masks, improving accuracy and reducing noise in age-correlation maps compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable body-wide spatial standardization and voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters in UK Biobank MR images.

Method: Uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from VIBESegmentator to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration, evaluated on 4000 subjects against intensity-only, uniGradICON, and MIRTK methods.

Result: Achieved higher Dice scores (0.77 males, 0.75 females) and reduced label errors compared to other methods, with less noisy age-correlation maps.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves whole-body MR image registration accuracy and utility for medical research.

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content).
  We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.
  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment.
  In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

*Peirong Zhang,Yidan Zhang,Luxiao Xu,Jinliang Lin,Zonghao Guo,Fengxiang Wang,Xue Yang,Kaiwen Wei,Lei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoViS introduces a progressive search-and-reasoning framework for remote sensing visual grounding, excelling in detecting small targets and complex geospatial relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in transferring multimodal large language models to remote sensing, where small targets and intricate geospatial relations hinder performance.

Method: GeoViS reformulates grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process, using tree-structured visual cues for iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on five benchmarks, demonstrating precise geospatial understanding and strong generalization.

Conclusion: GeoViS effectively tackles remote sensing visual grounding challenges, offering interpretability and superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

*Yifan Zhou,Takehiko Ohkawa,Guwenxiao Zhou,Kanoko Goto,Takumi Hirose,Yusuke Sekikawa,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba) for 3D hand pose estimation, addressing occlusion challenges by better modeling global context compared to CNNs like ResNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D HPE methods using ResNet struggle with occlusions due to limited global context modeling.

Method: DF-Mamba leverages selective state modeling and deformable state scanning to capture global cues from local features.

Result: DF-Mamba outperforms other backbones like VMamba and Spatial-Mamba across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: DF-Mamba offers superior accuracy for 3D HPE with efficient inference, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CAEVL, a model for UAV image localization without paired UAV-satellite training data, using augmented satellite images and achieving competitive results on the ViLD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is crucial for UAVs, but existing methods require costly paired data, which is often unavailable.

Method: The paper introduces CAEVL, a model trained using satellite-view images augmented to simulate UAV-view conditions, eliminating the need for paired datasets.

Result: CAEVL achieves competitive performance on the ViLD dataset, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization without paired training data.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, reducing dependency on costly paired datasets.

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Jiangbei Yue,Guangliang Cheng,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework to better detect hate speech in videos by improving multimodal fusion and adversarial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fuse multimodal semantics effectively and lack nuanced hateful content understanding due to the complexity of video context.

Method: RAMF uses Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) and Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) for multimodal fusion, and adversarial reasoning for contextual understanding.

Result: RAMF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3% in Macro-F1 and 7% in hate class recall on two datasets.

Conclusion: The RAMF framework effectively addresses multimodal fusion and nuanced hate speech detection, showing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

### [81] [AttMetNet: Attention-Enhanced Deep Neural Network for Methane Plume Detection in Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02751)
*Rakib Ahsan,MD Sadik Hossain Shanto,Md Sultanul Arifin,Tanzima Hashem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttMetNet is an attention-enhanced deep learning framework using Sentinel-2 imagery for methane plume detection, outperforming traditional and CNN-based methods with fewer false positives and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate methane emission detection is crucial for mitigating climate change, but existing methods struggle with false positives and lack methane-specific feature prioritization.

Method: AttMetNet combines NDMI with an attention-enhanced U-Net to amplify methane absorption features and suppress noise, trained with focal loss to handle class imbalance.

Result: AttMetNet achieves lower false positive rates, better precision-recall balance, and higher IoU compared to recent methods.

Conclusion: AttMetNet offers a robust, methane-specific solution for satellite-based methane plume detection, improving accuracy and practicality.

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

### [82] [Rethinking Surgical Smoke: A Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Method and Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02780)
*Qifan Liang,Junlin Li,Zhen Han,Xihao Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Bin Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STANet is proposed as the first smoke-type-aware desmoking network for laparoscopic videos, distinguishing between Diffusion and Ambient Smoke with improved accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing desmoking methods ignore the distinctions between different smoke types, which affects visual guidance in laparoscopic surgery.

Method: STANet includes a smoke mask segmentation sub-network for joint smoke mask and type prediction, and a reconstruction sub-network guided by smoke masks. A coarse-to-fine disentanglement module addresses smoke type entanglement.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality and demonstrates superior generalization across surgical tasks.

Conclusion: STANet effectively addresses smoke-type-specific challenges in laparoscopic video desmoking, enhancing surgical visual guidance.

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiX is a text-to-intrinsic generation framework that produces coherent sets of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, depth) using Query-Broadcast Attention and Tensor LoRA, achieving better alignment and preference scores than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of generating structured, physically consistent intrinsic maps from text prompts, which is crucial for scene understanding and manipulation.

Method: LumiX uses Query-Broadcast Attention for structural consistency and Tensor LoRA for efficient cross-map relations, enabling stable joint diffusion training.

Result: LumiX achieves 23% higher alignment and improved preference scores (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to state-of-the-art methods, and supports image-conditioned decomposition.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates structured diffusion for coherent intrinsic map generation, outperforming existing approaches in consistency and efficiency.

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackNetV5 improves small object tracking by introducing Motion Direction Decoupling and Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement, outperforming previous versions with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of TrackNetV1-V4: occlusion handling in V1-V3 and directional ambiguity in V4 by enhancing motion and spatio-temporal features.

Method: Integrates Motion Direction Decoding (MDD) for directional priors and Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) for occlusion recovery using Transformer-based refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art F1-score (0.9859) and accuracy (0.9733) with only a 3.7% increase in FLOPs, maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: TrackNetV5 sets a new benchmark for fast-moving small object tracking by effectively addressing occlusion and motion ambiguity with efficient computation.

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between closed-source and open-source multimodal models by addressing the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and benchmarks capable of diagnosing diverse editing weaknesses.

Method: Develops an end-to-end pipeline with a unified post-verification stage and trains a 7B dual-task expert model (Qwen-Verify) for quality control, resulting in the UnicEdit-10M dataset. Also proposes UnicBench for evaluating editing tasks.

Result: Produces UnicEdit-10M and UnicBench, enabling scalable quality control and fine-grained diagnosis of model weaknesses. Analysis highlights limitations of mainstream models.

Conclusion: The introduced pipeline and benchmark provide valuable resources and insights for improving multimodal models, guiding future research directions.

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HUD, a framework for Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) that addresses issues like modification subject ambiguity and limited semantic focus by leveraging disparity in video-text information density. It achieves top performance in CVR and CIR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in CVR, such as ambiguity and lack of detailed semantic focus, caused by ignoring the information density disparity between video and text modalities.

Method: Proposes HUD, a Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network, with components like Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment for precise multi-modal query understanding.

Result: HUD achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets for both CVR and Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) tasks.

Conclusion: HUD effectively addresses CVR challenges by exploiting multi-modal disparities and achieves superior performance, demonstrating applicability to similar tasks like CIR.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses shared world modeling, aiming to synthesize diverse videos from a set of input images representing the same underlying world in different camera poses.

Method: IC-World leverages large video models' in-context generation capability for parallel video synthesis, enhanced by reinforcement learning (Group Relative Policy Optimization) and novel reward models for scene-level geometry and object-level motion consistency.

Result: IC-World outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating videos with high geometry and motion consistency.

Conclusion: This work pioneers systematic exploration of shared world modeling using video-based world models, demonstrating IC-World's effectiveness.

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

TL;DR: PhyCustom introduces a fine-tuning framework with two novel losses to improve physical concept customization in diffusion-based text-to-image models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack explicit physical knowledge incorporation, leading to inaccurate physical properties in generated images despite relevant text prompts.

Method: PhyCustom uses isometric loss for physical concept learning and decouple loss to prevent mixing of independent concepts during fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show PhyCustom excels in physical customization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: PhyCustom successfully enhances diffusion models' ability to customize physical concepts, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial training boosts model robustness but paradoxically increases attack transferability, posing ecosystem risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether adversarial training unintentionally enhances the transferability of adversarial examples.

Method: Trained 36 diverse models (CNNs and ViTs) and conducted thorough transferability tests.

Result: Adversarially trained models produce more transferable adversarial examples than standard models.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluations should include both resistance to attacks and propensity to generate transferable adversarial examples.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

*Vishal Dubey,Pallavi Tyagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies the robustness and fairness of AI-generated content (IP-AIGC) detectors for Indian and South-Asian faces, revealing that fine-tuning improves in-domain performance but degrades accuracy on identity-preserving edits, indicating overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of current AI-generated content detectors for identity-preserving edits (IP-AIGC) on Indian and South-Asian faces, addressing gaps in fairness and generalization.

Method: Training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF were used, and two IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) were created using commercial generators. Detectors (AIDE and Effort) were evaluated under pretrained and fine-tuned regimes using metrics like AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy.

Result: Fine-tuning improved in-domain performance (e.g., Effort AUC rose from 0.739 to 0.944) but degraded performance on IP-AIGC tests (e.g., AIDE AUC dropped from 0.923 to 0.563), suggesting overfitting. Pretrained models performed well on non-IP images, indicating brittleness to identity-preserving edits.

Conclusion: The study highlights IP-AIGC detection as a challenging task for Indian populations, calling for representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmarks to improve generalization.

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing annotated data scarcity in digital dentistry, the challenge aimed to benchmark semi-supervised learning for tasks like pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration.

Method: The challenge featured two tasks: semi-supervised segmentation (using nnU-Net and Mamba-like models) and rigid registration (combining PointNetLK with SVD and geometric augmentation). Labeled and unlabeled CBCT and IOS data were provided.

Result: Top methods achieved Dice scores of 0.967 for segmentation and hybrid neural-classical refinement improved registration accuracy despite label limitations.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

TL;DR: An online RL post-training framework enhances camera-controlled video generation by optimizing pretrained models with a geometry reward and segment-level feedback, outperforming SFT baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for camera-controlled video generation, leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training underexplored despite its potential benefits.

Method: The proposed framework uses online RL post-training to optimize a pretrained video generator. It introduces a verifiable geometry reward for dense segment-level feedback, comparing 3D camera trajectories between generated and reference videos via segment-wise relative poses.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms SFT baselines in camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality.

Conclusion: Online RL post-training with geometry rewards is superior for advancing camera-controlled video generation compared to traditional SFT methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Motivation: To understand how different LiDAR-to-image projections influence metric place recognition when paired with advanced vision models.

Method: Developed a modular retrieval pipeline to isolate projection effects, tested with consistent geometric channels across datasets.

Result: Identified projection traits critical for discriminative power and robustness; validated findings with real-world dataset tests.

Conclusion: Well-designed projections can effectively replace end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a phase-aware strategy using Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA adapters to accelerate diffusion models efficiently, achieving 5x speedup with minimal training cost and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models suffer from high computational costs and redundant inference steps, while existing distillation methods add retraining costs and degrade generalization.

Method: Introduces Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA adapters to apply smaller speedups to early stages and larger ones to later phases, trained with minimal samples and resources.

Result: Achieves up to 5x acceleration without compromising visual quality, trained in just one hour on a single V100 GPU.

Conclusion: Lightweight LoRA adapters provide an efficient and generalized solution for accelerating diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRD improves high-resolution image understanding by integrating multi-resolution semantic fusion and open-vocabulary detection, preserving object integrity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fragment objects across image crops, disrupting semantic similarity computations. High-resolution images require handling objects of varying sizes at different resolutions.

Method: Proposes MRD: multi-resolution semantic fusion integrates similarity maps from different resolutions, and an OVD model localizes objects globally using sliding-window detection.

Result: Experiments show MRD enhances high-resolution image understanding benchmarks across MLLMs.

Conclusion: MRD effectively addresses fragmentation and semantic bias, improving accuracy and object integrity in high-resolution images.

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle limited diversity in bitwise autoregressive models caused by binary classification constraints and overly sharp logits distributions.

Method: Proposes DiverseAR with adaptive logits scaling for smoother predictions and an energy-based path search to maintain visual quality.

Result: DiverseAR significantly enhances diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation without compromising visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses diversity limitations in bitwise AR models, balancing diversity and quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Motivation: Address limitations of 3DGS (multi-view inconsistencies) and 2DGS (texture detail loss) by combining their strengths.

Method: Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization, Adaptive Type Exchange, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization to dynamically balance 2D and 3D Gaussians.

Result: EGGS achieves superior rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EGGS provides a practical, high-quality solution for novel view synthesis by leveraging hybrid Gaussian representations.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Conclusion: LoVoRA presents an effective, scalable solution for mask-free video object editing, advancing the field of video manipulation.

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets.

Conclusion: UltraFast-LieNET offers a superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited computational resources.

Abstract: In low-light environments like nighttime driving, image degradation severely challenges in-vehicle camera safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods indiscriminately fuse LiDAR and camera data in BEV, leading to degraded performance due to geometric disparities. BEVDilation aims to prioritize LiDAR while leveraging image guidance.

Method: Introduces Sparse Voxel Dilation Block for densifying foreground voxels using image priors and Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block for LiDAR feature enhancement with image semantics.

Result: BEVDilation outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes benchmark and shows robustness to depth noise.

Conclusion: The LiDAR-centric approach with implicit image guidance effectively mitigates fusion challenges, improving detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

*Xiang Xu,Ao Liang,Youquan Liu,Linfeng Li,Lingdong Kong,Ziwei Liu,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U4D is an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling that improves realism and temporal stability by focusing on semantically challenging regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative frameworks treat all spatial regions uniformly, leading to artifacts in complex areas. U4D addresses this by incorporating uncertainty estimation.

Method: U4D uses a pretrained segmentation model to estimate spatial uncertainty, then performs two-stage generation: uncertainty-region modeling and uncertainty-conditioned completion. It also employs a MoST block for temporal coherence.

Result: U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: U4D advances 4D world modeling reliability for autonomous perception and simulation by addressing uncertainty and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

TL;DR: RxBench is a benchmark developed to evaluate LLMs in prescription review, covering common error types and tasks. It tested 18 LLMs, showing top performers like Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 outperforming others and even matching human pharmacists in some tasks. Fine-tuning improved mid-tier models to rival top LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate LLMs in clinical decision support, specifically prescription review, by addressing common error types and providing a standardized framework.

Method: Developed RxBench, a benchmark with single-choice, multiple-choice, and short-answer items reviewed by pharmacists. Evaluated 18 LLMs and compared their performance to human pharmacists. Fine-tuned a mid-tier model based on insights.

Result: Top-performing LLMs (Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, DeepSeek-R1-0528) outperformed others and matched human performance in some tasks. Fine-tuning improved mid-tier models to compete with top LLMs.

Conclusion: RxBench provides a standardized framework for evaluating LLMs in prescription review, revealing their capabilities and limitations. It aids in developing reliable clinical tools, with fine-tuning showing promise for specialization.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

TL;DR: CCD is a novel inference framework for DLMs that improves generation quality by leveraging historical context and adaptive sampling, achieving faster and better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DLM inference methods lack reliable metrics, leading to inconsistent trajectories and suboptimal generation.

Method: CCD introduces trajectory rectification using historical context and adaptive sampling based on consistency metrics.

Result: Empirical results show up to 3.48x speedup and 3.91% performance improvement on benchmarks.

Conclusion: CCD effectively enhances DLM inference by improving coherence and efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

TL;DR: Introducing memory-efficient, reversible LLM architectures inspired by symmetric/symplectic differential equations, reducing memory usage by avoiding intermediate activation storage and enabling larger batches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory and computational costs of training and fine-tuning LLMs by leveraging reversible architectures.

Method: Propose reversible LLM architectures using time-reversible dynamics and a fine-tuning method to convert non-reversible LLMs into reversible ones.

Result: Achieves comparable or improved performance on benchmarks with reduced memory usage and increased throughput.

Conclusion: Reversible architectures offer a scalable and efficient solution for LLM training and fine-tuning, lowering memory and computational costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods for Dialect Identification (DI), reducing GPU memory usage by 73.25% and speeding up training by 2.1x while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning speech models for DI is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods improve parameter efficiency but lack memory efficiency and training speed.

Method: The study applies MEFT methods, originally for language processing, to pre-trained speech models (Whisper) for DI tasks, evaluating GPU memory usage and speed.

Result: MEFT reduced GPU memory usage by 73.25% and accelerated training by 2.1x, maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

Conclusion: MEFT is a viable solution for efficient DI fine-tuning, balancing memory, speed, and accuracy.

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

Motivation: Abusive speech on social media is a growing challenge due to evolving slang and obfuscation techniques. Existing detection systems struggle with these changes, necessitating scalable and adaptive solutions.

Method: The authors propose a TF-IDF-based sample selection mechanism to reduce the training set size by 25%, keeping only the most informative examples. They also augment BERT's tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants.

Result: Experiments show competitive performance on hate speech classification while improving computational efficiency. The method maintains accuracy despite reduced training data.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable solution for abusive content moderation by balancing performance and efficiency, adapting to evolving abusive language.

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The MODOMA system enables unsupervised language acquisition experiments using interacting adult and child agents, producing a knowledge-based language model for generating and parsing new utterances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore computational modeling of language acquisition through interaction between agents, validating the MODOMA approach.

Method: Utilizes a multi-agent system with statistical and rule-based procedures, allowing controlled experiments and explicit representation of acquired grammatical knowledge.

Result: Successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, mirroring patterns seen in human-generated data.

Conclusion: MODOMA offers novel possibilities for computational language acquisition experiments, demonstrating validity in modeling the process.

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiteReason is a method combining lightweight latent reasoning with RL to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing LLMs' reasoning traces with RL is computationally expensive, especially for narrative tasks involving many tokens.

Method: LiteReason uses a Reasoning Projector module to produce latent tokens, skipping reasoning steps, and integrates RL to switch between latent and discrete reasoning.

Result: Results show LiteReason outperforms baselines, reduces reasoning length by 77-92%, and matches non-latent RL performance.

Conclusion: LiteReason efficiently balances performance and computation in RL training for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

Motivation: To understand the impact of prompt specificity on LLM reasoning performance, as it remains understudied despite its critical role.

Method: Develop DETAIL framework, generate multi-level prompts with GPT-4, quantify specificity using perplexity, and assess correctness via GPT-based semantic equivalence.

Result: Detailed prompts enhance accuracy, particularly for smaller models (e.g., O3-mini) and procedural tasks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of adaptive prompting strategies and provides tools/data for future research.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

TL;DR: CAIRNS is a framework designed to help farmer advisors get credible, readable answers from complex climate adaptation data sources, outperforming baselines without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To sustain food production amid climate change, credible and readable climate adaptation strategies are needed, sourced from both structured and unstructured data.

Method: CAIRNS uses a structured ScholarGuide prompt for readability and citation reliability, along with a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator for robust assessment.

Result: CAIRNS outperforms baselines on most metrics, confirmed by ablation studies, and shows strong correlation with human judgment in evaluation.

Conclusion: CAIRNS provides a reliable, readable, and verifiable question-answering framework for climate adaptation strategies without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how language models handle conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, showing their ability to use correct context and resist incorrect one.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models reason over conflicting biomedical contexts and assess their contextual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses HealthContradict dataset (920 expert-verified instances) with varying prompt settings (correct, incorrect, contradictory contexts) to measure impact on model outputs.

Result: Fine-tuned biomedical models excel in leveraging correct context and resisting incorrect context, beyond just pretraining knowledge.

Conclusion: HealthContradict provides clearer distinctions of models' contextual reasoning, highlighting their robustness in biomedical question-answering.

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

*Jack Lu,Ryan Teehan,Jinran Jin,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper systematically studies LLMs acting as problem solvers and verifiers across 37 models, exploring verification within and across model families and the impact of post-training. It introduces 'verifier gain' to predict performance improvements and finds cross-family verification most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively investigate solver-verifier interactions in LLMs, including self-verification, verification within/across model families, and the impact of post-training, which prior studies have overlooked.

Method: Evaluates 37 LLMs of varying sizes, families, and post-trained variants across 9 benchmarks covering diverse reasoning tasks. Introduces 'verifier gain' to measure verifier benefits and analyzes scaling effects and dataset verifiability.

Result: Cross-family verification outperforms self-verification; post-training weakens self-improvement but enhances cross-family gains. Mathematical/logical tasks are most verifiable. Verifier gain and false positive rates scale with model size/post-training.

Conclusion: Cross-family verification is highly effective, while post-training shifts improvement dynamics. Mathematical and logical tasks are inherently more verifiable, providing insights for optimizing solver-verifier systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA systems struggle with factual consistency and safety in sensitive domains like healthcare and government welfare.

Method: KARMA uses a dual-encoder architecture, gated memory unit, and safety-aware decoder to enhance knowledge integration and output safety.

Result: KARMA outperforms baselines in answer quality and safety on a proprietary QA dataset.

Conclusion: KARMA provides a trustworthy and adaptive solution for domain-specific QA systems.

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering (QA) systems for services face unique challenges in integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources while ensuring both accuracy and safety. Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios. KARMA incorporates a dual-encoder architecture to fuse structured and unstructured knowledge sources, a gated memory unit to dynamically regulate external knowledge integration, and a safety-aware controllable decoder that mitigates unsafe outputs using safety classification and guided generation techniques. Extensive experiments on a proprietary QA dataset demonstrate that KARMA outperforms strong baselines in both answer quality and safety. This study offers a comprehensive solution for building trustworthy and adaptive QA systems in service contexts.

### [123] [What Signals Really Matter for Misinformation Tasks? Evaluating Fake-News Detection and Virality Prediction under Real-World Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02552)
*Francesco Paolo Savatteri,Chahan Vidal-Gorène,Florian Cafiero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates fake-news detection and virality prediction, comparing textual embeddings with lightweight numeric features and sequence models. Textual content is effective for fake-news detection, while numeric features remain viable for constrained compute. Virality prediction is more challenging and sensitive to label definitions. Results are robust across embeddings, with implications for evaluation design and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess practical solutions for fake-news detection and virality prediction in operational settings requiring rapid response, comparing textual and numeric approaches.

Method: Used EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets; compared RoBERTa and Mistral embeddings, numeric features (timing, followers, etc.), and sequence models (GRU, gating, Transformer). Analyzed performance and label sensitivity.

Result: Textual content excels in fake-news detection; numeric features are viable alternatives. Virality prediction is harder and label-sensitive. Non-linear structure (t-SNE) aids virality prediction. Embedding swaps yield minor differences.

Conclusion: Textual embeddings dominate fake-news detection; numeric features suffice when constraints exist. Virality prediction requires careful label construction and benefits from non-linear analysis. Reproducibility challenges are noted.

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADORE is a self-sustaining framework for e-commerce search relevance modeling, combining intent-aligned training data, adversarial robustness, and domain-specific knowledge distillation to overcome data scarcity and semantic gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in e-commerce search relevance modeling, such as semantic gaps in term-matching methods and neural models' reliance on scarce domain-specific hard samples.

Method: ADORE integrates three modules: Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination (intent-aligned training data), Error-type-aware Data Synthesis (adversarial examples), and Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (domain-specific attribute hierarchies).

Result: Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing confirm ADORE's effectiveness.

Conclusion: ADORE establishes a resource-efficient, cognitively aligned paradigm for relevance modeling in industrial applications.

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAPO introduces an adaptive curriculum mechanism for reinforcement learning in large language models, separating positive and negative advantage signals to improve guidance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods mix positive and negative signals indiscriminately, causing ambiguous guidance and limited gains in training large language models.

Method: CAPO uses a curriculum approach, starting with positive-only advantage samples for imitation learning, then introducing negative signals to enhance discriminative capabilities.

Result: CAPO achieves stable improvements in mathematical reasoning and generalizes well to multimodal GUI reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: CAPO is a versatile and robust optimization framework compatible with various optimization methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

### [127] [Input Order Shapes LLM Semantic Alignment in Multi-Document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02665)
*Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibit a primacy effect, favoring the first-seen article in summaries, raising concerns for fairness in applications relying on LLM-generated overviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs equally weight inputs when summarizing abortion-related news, given their increasing use in critical applications.

Method: Constructed 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permuted orders, and evaluated summaries using ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and SummaC.

Result: Significant primacy effect found for BERTScore, showing summaries align more with the first-seen article; Positions 2 and 3 did not differ.

Conclusion: LLMs' selective preference for early inputs poses risks for fairness in applications like AI-generated summaries and agentic systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

### [128] [An Empirical Survey of Model Merging Algorithms for Social Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02689)
*Daiki Shirafuji,Tatsuhiko Saito,Yasutomo Kimura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Empirical comparison of seven model merging algorithms for mitigating bias in LLMs, revealing trade-offs between bias reduction and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address societal biases inherited by LLMs to improve fairness and social trust.

Method: Survey seven model merging algorithms (Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, Nearswap) using 13 open-weight models from GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. Evaluate on three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, HONEST) and SuperGLUE benchmark tasks.

Result: Trade-off observed: greater bias reduction degrades downstream performance, especially in reading comprehension and reasoning tasks. Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap balance bias mitigation and performance best.

Conclusion: Model merging algorithms show promise for bias mitigation, but excessive debiasing harms linguistic abilities. SLERP with moderate weights is the most balanced choice.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

### [129] [CREST: Universal Safety Guardrails Through Cluster-Guided Cross-Lingual Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02711)
*Lavish Bansal,Naman Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CREST introduces a multilingual safety classification model supporting 100 languages with minimal parameters, addressing underrepresented low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety guardrails in LLMs are biased towards high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages underrepresented.

Method: CREST uses cluster-based cross-lingual transfer, trained on 13 high-resource languages, to generalize across 100 languages.

Result: CREST outperforms comparable models and achieves competitive results against larger models on six safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: Universal, language-agnostic safety systems like CREST are crucial for scalable global deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

### [130] [Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719)
*Julian Ma,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs exhibit near-optimal Bayesian strategies in multimodal tasks, similar to humans. It introduces BayesBench, a benchmark evaluating LLMs' performance in magnitude estimation tasks, revealing gaps between accuracy and robustness in uncertainty handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLMs implicitly use Bayesian strategies for multimodal integration, inspired by human perceptual processing, and to assess their robustness beyond accuracy metrics.

Method: The study uses BayesBench, a benchmark with four magnitude estimation tasks (text and image), evaluating nine LLMs and human judgments. It employs controlled ablations of noise, context, and prompts to measure performance and introduces a Bayesian Consistency Score.

Result: LLMs like GPT-5 Mini show high accuracy in text tasks but fail in visual cue integration. Accuracy doesn't ensure robustness, revealing a gap between capability and strategy. Bayesian Consistency Score detects behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates.

Conclusion: Accuracy-centric benchmarks may overlook LLMs' brittleness in uncertainty handling. The findings highlight emergent Bayesian tendencies and the need for robust multimodal evaluation tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

TL;DR: SurveyEval benchmark evaluates LLM-based survey systems on quality, coherence, and accuracy, showing specialized systems outperform general ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of evaluating complex LLM-based survey-generation systems motivates the creation of SurveyEval.

Method: SurveyEval evaluates surveys across three dimensions (quality, coherence, accuracy) using LLM-as-a-Judge augmented with human references.

Result: Specialized survey-generation systems outperform general long-text or paper-writing systems in quality.

Conclusion: SurveyEval serves as a scalable testbed to improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and criteria.

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniFact, a unified framework for comparing Hallucination Detection (HD) and Fact Verification (FV) in LLMs, demonstrating their complementary strengths and advocating for their integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations in LLMs and bridge the divide between HD and FV paradigms.

Method: Develop UniFact, a framework for dynamic generation of model outputs and factuality labels to compare HD and FV.

Result: HD and FV are complementary; hybrid methods outperform standalone approaches.

Conclusion: Integration of HD and FV is essential for advancing LLM reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

TL;DR: A three-tier data-synthesis method improves dialogue-based GREC by balancing realism and controllability, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited annotated dialogue grounding data and distribution shift in GREC tasks.

Method: Proposes a three-tier data-synthesis approach to generate scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding.

Result: Fine-tuning on synthesized data leads to significant improvements over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances dialogue-based GREC performance by leveraging synthesized data.

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: TriLex is a three-stage framework that expands sentiment lexicons for low-resource African languages, improving sentiment analysis performance of AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource African languages are underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting NLP system performance.

Method: TriLex combines corpus-based extraction, cross-lingual mapping, and retrieval-augmented generation to enrich lexicons. Performance of AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa is evaluated using the enriched lexicon.

Result: AfroXLMR outperforms with F1-scores >80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu. AfriBERTa achieves ~64% F1-scores despite no pre-training. Both models surpass traditional baselines, with ensemble methods boosting robustness.

Conclusion: TriLex is scalable and effective for sentiment lexicon expansion and modeling in low-resource South African languages.

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes stable rank, an intrinsic quality signal for LLM alignment without external supervision, achieving high accuracy and task improvements. Introduces SR-GRPO for reinforcement learning, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of external supervision in LLM alignment (scarce annotations, reward hacking, biases) by deriving quality signals from internal model representations.

Method: Introduces stable rank to measure effective dimensionality of hidden states. Uses SR-GRPO, a reinforcement learning approach leveraging stable rank as a reward signal.

Result: Achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench, improves task accuracy by 11.3 percentage points via Best-of-N sampling. SR-GRPO boosts Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on math.

Conclusion: Internal model geometry can provide scalable alignment signals, reducing reliance on external supervision.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A comprehensive benchmark (TCM-BEST4SDT) is developed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), addressing gaps in assessing treatment decision-making through four tasks and three evaluation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack assessment of treatment decision-making in TCM, prompting the need for a more holistic evaluation framework.

Method: The benchmark involves expert-led clinical case-based tasks, specialized reward models for prescription-syndrome congruence, and integrates three evaluation mechanisms.

Result: Tested on 15 mainstream LLMs, TCM-BEST4SDT effectively evaluates performance in TCM applications.

Conclusion: TCM-BEST4SDT fills a critical gap in LLM evaluation for TCM and is publicly available to advance intelligent TCM research.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BOOM is a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that translates lecture audio and slides into text, localized slides, and synthesized speech, enhancing accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of localizing multimodal educational content (audio and slides) for online learning drives the need for systems like BOOM to provide a complete learning experience.

Method: BOOM jointly translates lecture audio and slides, producing synchronized outputs across text, localized slides, and synthesized speech.

Result: Experiments show BOOM improves accessibility and benefits downstream tasks like summarization and question answering.

Conclusion: BOOM offers an effective end-to-end solution for multilingual lecture localization, preserving original content while enhancing accessibility.

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.

TL;DR: Introduction of promptolution, a unified open-source framework for prompt optimization to enhance LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of practical adoption due to unmaintained and isolated research codebases for prompt optimization.

Method: Developed promptolution, a modular framework integrating multiple contemporary discrete prompt optimizers, independent of LLM implementation.

Result: A single extensible system catering to both practitioners and researchers for streamlined prompt optimization.

Conclusion: promptolution offers a practical solution to facilitate widespread adoption of prompt optimization techniques.

Abstract: Prompt optimization has become crucial for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) across a broad range of tasks. Although many research papers show its effectiveness, practical adoption is hindered as existing implementations are often tied to unmaintained and isolated research codebases. To address this, we introduce promptolution, a unified and modular open-source framework that provides all components required for prompt optimization within a single extensible system for both practitioners and researchers. It integrates multiple contemporary discrete prompt optimizers while remaining agnostic to the underlying LLM implementation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how system prompts enhance multilingual performance in LLMs, proposing a framework for evaluation and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-lingual reliability of LLMs using a single system prompt.

Method: A four-dimensional evaluation framework tested on five languages, three LLMs, and benchmarks, with automated prompt optimization.

Result: Optimized prompts improved metrics by 5-10% and induced structured reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: System prompt optimization is scalable for achieving robust multilingual LLM behavior.

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

### [141] [Bangla Hate Speech Classification with Fine-tuned Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02845)
*Yalda Keivan Jafari,Krishno Dey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hate speech recognition in Bangla, a low-resource language, by evaluating baseline methods and transformer-based models, finding BanglaBERT performs best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech recognition in Bangla is challenging due to limited datasets and linguistic diversity. The study aims to improve automated moderation tools for Bangla social media.

Method: Baseline methods (Majority, Random, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree) were compared with transformer models (DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, XLM-RoBERTa) for hate speech detection.

Result: Transformer models generally outperformed baselines, with BanglaBERT achieving the best performance despite its smaller size, highlighting the importance of language-specific pre-training.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for pre-trained language models tailored for low-resource languages like Bangla.

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource lan- guages remains a difficult problem due to in- sufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the grow- ing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under- represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official base- lines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vec- tor Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and De- cision Tree as baseline methods. We also uti- lized transformer-based models such as Dis- tilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM- RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed base- line methods for the subtasks, except for Distil- BERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language- specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre- trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

*Haonan Wang,Chao Du,Kenji Kawaguchi,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkMerge is a decoding strategy for open-ended reasoning tasks like code generation, improving performance without relying on majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Majority voting isn't suitable for open-ended reasoning tasks where defining a 'majority' is unclear. ThinkMerge aims to address this limitation.

Method: ThinkMerge averages next-token logits from K parallel reasoning traces at synchronization points, integrating with tools like vLLM/SGLang and standard decoding techniques.

Result: Improved performance on coding tasks (e.g., LiveCodeBench) and web-based research tasks (e.g., GAIA), with significant gains in pass@1 scores.

Conclusion: ThinkMerge effectively scales parallel reasoning for open-ended tasks, outperforming majority voting and enhancing consistency.

Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

### [143] [Fast-Decoding Diffusion Language Models via Progress-Aware Confidence Schedules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02892)
*Amr Mohamed,Yang Zhang,Michalis Vazirgiannis,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SchED is a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) that accelerates decoding without significant performance loss, achieving up to 4x speedups while retaining nearly full accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dLLMs suffer from slow, iterative sampling, limiting their practical utility. SchED addresses this by enabling faster decoding while maintaining performance.

Method: SchED aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. It is evaluated on two dLLM families across ten benchmarks.

Result: SchED achieves significant speedups (up to 4x) with 99.1%-100% performance retention. It outperforms prior early-exit methods, especially in long-form generation.

Conclusion: SchED effectively balances speed and accuracy, making dLLM decoding more efficient and robust across various tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

*Tanmay Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework introduces visual knowledge graphs to help users identify and correct hallucinations in Large Language Models, improving reliability and response quality through structured feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operational constraints and inconsistencies in LLMs often lead to credible hallucinations, which current mitigation strategies fail to address deterministically.

Method: The paper proposes organizing proprietary knowledge and model outputs into interactive visual knowledge graphs, linking assertions to truth sources and indicating confidence levels.

Result: Users can diagnose inconsistencies, spot weak reasoning, and provide corrective feedback via the visual interface, enhancing model reliability.

Conclusion: The human-in-the-loop workflow improves model reliability and response quality by creating a structured feedback loop.

Abstract: Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.

*Muyu Pan,Dheeraj Kodakandla,Mahfuza Farooque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework combines NLP, symbolic computation, and a fine-tuned LLM to translate English to CNF logic, reducing hallucinations and improving precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating the translation of natural language to formal logic can enhance reasoning and debugging in software systems, but LLMs' hallucinations pose challenges.

Method: The framework uses NLP techniques, self-defined grammar, symbolic libraries, and a fine-tuned LLM to convert English to CNF logic.

Result: Early experiments show the fine-tuned model corrects hallucinations, ensuring reliable CNF generation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces hallucinations and improves precision in logical translation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

*Saeid Jamshidi,Kawser Wazed Nafi,Arghavan Moradi Dakhel,Negar Shahabi,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoCoP is a framework for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs, showing stable ethical behavior and minimal toxicity or latency impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for moral consistency in LLMs due to limitations of static alignment frameworks.

Method: MoCoP uses lexical integrity, semantic risk estimation, and reasoning-based judgment in a closed-loop system.

Result: Strong inverse correlation between ethics and toxicity (rET=-0.81), near-zero latency impact (rEL≈0).

Conclusion: MoCoP enables scalable, dynamic ethical evaluation, advancing computational morality in AI.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

*PIerre Dantas,Lucas Cordeiro,Youcheng Sun,Waldir Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal framework (LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem) to ensure reliable termination and convergence in LLM-assisted software verification, backed by theoretical guarantees and extensive empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based verification methods lack reliability due to weak theoretical foundations, causing unstable refinement processes. This work aims to provide a solid theoretical and empirical basis for predictable performance.

Method: The interaction between LLM and verifier is modeled as a Markov Chain with error-reduction probability ($δ$) determining state transitions. Theoretical bounds guarantee termination for any $δ>0$.

Result: Empirical testing (90,000+ trials) confirmed the theory: all runs achieved verification, with convergence factor $C_f≈1.0$. Three operational zones (marginal, practical, high-performance) were identified.

Conclusion: The framework provides predictable performance and resource planning for LLM-assisted verification, eliminating heuristic tuning and enabling safer deployment in critical software environments.

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

TL;DR: A lightweight web system converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code using vision-language models, enabling mixed-initiative refinement and version-controllable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static flowchart images are hard to edit or reuse, prompting the need for a tool that converts them into editable, structured formats.

Method: The system uses vision-language models to transform flowchart images into Mermaid.js code, supports refinement via text editing, drag-and-drop, and natural-language commands, and includes an AI assistant.

Result: Produces editable, version-controllable textual representations synchronized with diagrams, with introduced metrics evaluating accuracy, correctness, syntax, and completeness.

Conclusion: The system effectively bridges the gap between static flowcharts and editable visual workflows, offering enhanced usability and evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for decomposing complex world models into modular subcomponents, enabling parallel and interpretable modeling to improve computational efficiency and AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic world models are computationally demanding, but real-world scenarios often involve modular interactions. This motivates the need for efficient, parallelizable, and interpretable modeling approaches.

Method: The authors develop a framework to decompose complex world models (represented by transducers) into sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces.

Result: The framework enables parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modeling, supporting distributed inference.

Conclusion: The results provide a foundation for balancing AI safety's structural transparency needs with the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

*Shubhi Asthana,Bing Zhang,Chad DeLuca,Ruchi Mahindru,Hima Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STRIDE is a framework to decide when to use autonomous agentic AI versus simpler LLM calls, reducing unnecessary deployments and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to autonomous AI agents raises questions about when such complexity is truly needed, as indiscriminate use leads to higher costs and risks.

Method: STRIDE uses task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection analysis to assign an Agentic Suitability Score, guiding modality selection.

Result: STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, cut unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and reduced costs by 37% in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: STRIDE reframes agent adoption as necessity-driven, ensuring autonomy is used only when justified by benefits.

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

Motivation: To address human error and delay in digital collaboration tools, the study explores LLM agents' potential in wealth-management tasks.

Method: The study introduces synthetic domain data, simulates colleagues, and prototypes a task-generation pipeline. It creates a benchmark of 12 task-pairs with deterministic graders.

Result: Agents are more limited by end-to-end workflow reliability than mathematical reasoning, and autonomy level significantly impacts performance.

Conclusion: Accurate evaluation of models is crucial for benchmarking, as incorrect assessments hinder progress.

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

Motivation: To assess the reliability and robustness of autonomous trading agents in high-risk financial environments, which remain underexplored.

Method: TradeTrap systematically evaluates four core agent components under controlled perturbations in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting.

Result: Small perturbations can cause extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large drawdowns, showing agents can be systematically misled.

Conclusion: Current autonomous trading agents are vulnerable to system-level disruptions, highlighting the need for improved robustness.

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

### [153] [DialogGuard: Multi-Agent Psychosocial Safety Evaluation of Sensitive LLM Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02282)
*Han Luo,Guy Laban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DialogGuard is a multi-agent framework designed to assess psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses across five dimensions, outperforming non-LLM and single-agent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive services like mental health and crisis support, but their psychosocial safety remains under-evaluated.

Method: DialogGuard employs four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines (single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, stochastic majority voting) grounded in a shared rubric.

Result: Multi-agent mechanisms detect risks more accurately; dual-agent correction and majority voting balance accuracy, alignment, and robustness, while debate has higher recall but over-flags borderline cases.

Conclusion: DialogGuard, released as open-source with a web interface, aids prompt design, auditing, and supervision for vulnerable users, improving LLM safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental- health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent frame- work for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discrimi- natory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse gen- erative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi- agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog- Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language ratio- nales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

*Noorbakhsh Amiri Golilarz,Sindhuja Penchala,Shahram Rahimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights seven key deficiencies in current AI systems—such as lack of self-monitoring and adaptive learning—arguing they hinder robust generalization and autonomy. It proposes cognitively grounded AI as a solution, integrating neurocognitive principles for better self-regulation and alignment with human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid advancements, modern AI lacks self-monitoring, adaptability, and autonomy. The paper aims to identify these limitations and propose solutions inspired by neurocognitive principles.

Method: The paper analyzes seven core deficiencies in AI systems through comparative analysis of artificial and biological cognition, integrating insights from AI, cognitive science, and neuroscience.

Result: Current AI architectures (e.g., deep learning, transformers) cannot achieve robust generalization or lifelong adaptability due to structural limitations. Scaling alone won't resolve these issues.

Conclusion: A shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) is advocated, emphasizing self-directed adaptation and dynamic representation management, supported by oversight mechanisms for alignment with human values.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fun- damentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self- monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non- adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust general- ization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

*Pengju Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IACT is a dynamic, autonomous model replacing static workflows with bidirectional, stateful dialogues to handle open-ended tasks and runtime errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows that lack flexibility and resilience.

Method: IACT autonomously grows recursive agent topologies driven by user dialogue, featuring bidirectional interactions for error correction.

Result: Demonstrated practical deployment in kragent.ai, showing adaptability in real-world workflows.

Conclusion: IACT proves effective for scalable, autonomous task-solving with built-in error mitigation.

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

TL;DR: MERINDA is an FPGA-accelerated Model Recovery framework that reduces memory and energy usage compared to traditional NODEs, making it suitable for real-time edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Model Recovery (MR) on edge devices is challenging due to inefficiencies of neural ODEs (NODEs) on FPGAs, particularly regarding memory and energy consumption.

Method: MERINDA replaces iterative solvers in NODEs with a parallelizable neural architecture optimized for FPGAs.

Result: MERINDA reduces DRAM usage by nearly 11x and speeds up runtime by 2.2x compared to mobile GPUs.

Conclusion: MERINDA is highly efficient for resource-constrained, real-time mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS).

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

### [157] [Breast Cell Segmentation Under Extreme Data Constraints: Quantum Enhancement Meets Adaptive Loss Stabilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02302)
*Varun Kumar Dasoju,Qingsu Cheng,Zeyun Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for breast cell segmentation using minimal training data (599 images) with high accuracy (95.5% Dice score), leveraging quantum-inspired edge enhancement and adaptive loss functions to tackle class imbalance and boundary detection challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and time required for expert annotation of medical images, especially mammary epithelial nuclei datasets, motivated the development of a solution to reduce reliance on extensive labeled data.

Method: The framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement with multi-scale Gabor filters, a stabilized multi-component loss function, and complexity-based weighted sampling. It employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with pretrained weights and validates results using exponential moving averaging and outlier detection.

Result: Achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%, with quantum enhancement improving boundary accuracy by 2.1% and weighted sampling boosting small lesion detection by 3.8%.

Conclusion: The approach reduces annotation burden significantly, offering high performance with limited data, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in clinical AI development.

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

*Boyu Zhu,Xiaofei Wen,Wenjie Jacky Mo,Tinghui Zhu,Yanan Xie,Peng Qi,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniGuard introduces unified safety guardrails for omni-modal AI, addressing gaps in unimodal safeguarding with a large dataset and deliberate reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current guardrail research lacks robustness across diverse modalities and tasks, mainly focusing on unimodal settings. OmniGuard aims to solve this.

Method: OmniGuard uses a comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset (210K samples) and expert-model annotations for training, enabling safeguarding across all modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks confirm OmniGuard's effectiveness and generalization in multimodal safety scenarios.

Conclusion: OmniGuard provides a unified framework for robust omni-modal safeguarding, enhancing safety in human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

*Qiyao Xue,Weichen Liu,Shiqi Wang,Haoming Wang,Yuyang Wu,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReMindView-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning abilities across multiple viewpoints, revealing significant gaps in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack fine-grained benchmarks isolating multi-view spatial reasoning from single-view perception, highlighting the need for cognitively grounded evaluation tools.

Method: The study evaluates 15 VLMs using ReMindView-Bench, analyzing their performance through explicit (LLM-as-a-judge, self-consistency prompting) and implicit (linear probing, entropy dynamics) methods.

Result: VLMs excel in single-frame perception but falter in integrating information across views, showing progressive loss of task-relevant details and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect reasoning paths.

Conclusion: The results diagnose VLM spatial reasoning limitations and provide insights into how multi-view spatial mental models degrade, offering a benchmark and tools for future research.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative agent-based simulation system using LLMs for MMO games, offering realistic and cost-efficient optimization of numerical systems and mechanism design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for optimizing MMO game systems are costly and disruptive, while simplified simulations lack fidelity. The authors aim to create a more realistic and efficient alternative.

Method: The system combines LLMs (fine-tuned with SFT and RL on real player data) with a data-driven environment model to simulate player behavior and game dynamics.

Result: Experiments show the system accurately mimics real player behaviors and responses to interventions, providing a reliable optimization framework.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based simulation system is a promising, interpretable, and cost-efficient solution for optimizing MMO game designs.

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Supervised learning with synthetic error injection fails to significantly improve self-correction in language models, unlike reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore cost-effective alternatives to reinforcement learning for eliciting self-correction abilities in language models.

Method: Insert synthetic errors into reasoning chains, mask them, and supervise models to recognize and correct these mistakes.

Result: The method does not improve performance on synthetic tasks; models often parrot mistakes despite catching errors.

Conclusion: Synthetic error injection struggles with distribution shifts, reinforcing the effectiveness of on-policy reinforcement learning for self-correction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

TL;DR: An AI pipeline clusters prediction markets and identifies outcome-dependent pairs, achieving 60-70% accuracy and enabling trading strategies with 20% returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prediction markets often suffer from fragmentation due to overlapping or contradictory questions, which can obscure actionable insights.

Method: The pipeline uses natural-language understanding to cluster markets and detect outcome-dependent pairs (correlated or anti-correlated) within clusters.

Result: The agent achieves 60-70% accuracy in identifying relationships, and derived trading strategies yield ~20% returns over week-long periods.

Conclusion: Agentic AI and large language models can effectively uncover hidden semantic structures in prediction markets, providing valuable trading signals.

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

TL;DR: R-Few introduces a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework for stable AI self-evolution, combining lightweight human oversight and mixed training to mitigate issues like concept drift and bias reinforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unguided self-evolving AI systems often plateau or degrade due to issues like concept drift and diversity collapse. R-Few aims to enable stable, controllable self-evolution with minimal human supervision.

Method: R-Few uses a Challenger-Solver framework with lightweight human oversight (in-context grounding) and mixed training. The Challenger guides synthetic question generation using human-labeled examples, while the Solver trains on both human and synthetic data under a difficulty-based curriculum.

Result: R-Few achieves consistent improvements, e.g., Qwen3-8B-Base outperforms R-Zero by +3.0 points on math tasks and matches General-Reasoner's performance with 20x less human data.

Conclusion: R-Few's grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training mitigate drift and enable stable, controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

TL;DR: COPE, a Chain-of-Thought-enhanced LLM framework, predicts 90-day stroke outcomes from clinical notes with accuracy comparable to GPT-4.1 and better than other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes are rich but unstructured, limiting their use in traditional predictive models for stroke outcomes.

Method: COPE uses a two-step Chain-of-Thought framework with LLaMA-3-8B models: first generates reasoning, then predicts modified Rankin Scale scores.

Result: COPE outperformed ClinicalBERT, Clinical ML, and single-step LLMs, achieving MAE of 1.01 and +/-1 accuracy of 74.4%.

Conclusion: COPE is a lightweight, interpretable, and accurate solution for predicting stroke outcomes from unstructured clinical text.

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current moderation systems, like identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgments.

Method: Proposes Aetheria, a framework with five core agents using dynamic debate and RAG-based knowledge retrieval.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, especially for implicit risks, and generates traceable audit reports.

Conclusion: Aetheria advances trustworthy AI moderation with transparent, interpretable paradigms.

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

### [166] [Empathy Level Prediction in Multi-Modal Scenario with Supervisory Documentation Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02558)
*Yufei Xiao,Shangfei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method using video, audio, and text improves accuracy by incorporating supervisory documents during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing empathy prediction methods focus on single modalities (e.g., text) and ignore multi-modal data and privileged information like supervisory documents.

Method: The approach combines video, audio, and text data, using pre-trained networks for feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. Supervisory documents aid text feature extraction via Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

Result: Tests on multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets show superior performance compared to current methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques by leveraging multi-modal data and privileged supervisory information during training.

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Conclusion: PaperDebugger successfully integrates LLM-driven reasoning into editing workflows, offering a scalable and practical solution for academic writing.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

### [168] [Target-specific Adaptation and Consistent Degradation Alignment for Cross-Domain Remaining Useful Life Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02610)
*Yubo Hou,Mohamed Ragab,Min Wu,Chee-Keong Kwoh,Xiaoli Li,Zhenghua Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACDA, a novel domain adaptation method for cross-domain RUL prediction, addressing domain discrepancy and degradation stage inconsistencies to outperform existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RUL prediction methods assume similar data distributions for training and testing, which fails in real-world industrial settings. Traditional adversarial domain adaptation overlooks target-specific details and degradation consistency.

Method: Proposes TACDA, combining target domain reconstruction with adversarial adaptation to retain target-specific information and a clustering strategy for aligning similar degradation stages.

Result: TACDA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in RUL prediction across two evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TACDA effectively addresses domain discrepancy and degradation inconsistencies, enhancing cross-domain RUL prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/keyplay/TACDA.

*Mattia Giuri,Mathias Jackermeier,Alessandro Abate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for learning multi-task policies using LTL instructions, addressing limitations in environments with overlapping events, and employs GNNs for structured task representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with environments where multiple high-level events overlap or interact, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The approach conditions policies on sequences of Boolean formulae aligned with automaton transitions, using GNNs for encoding.

Result: Experiments in a chess-based environment show improved performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles complex LTL instructions in multi-task reinforcement learning scenarios.

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

### [170] [Exploring Depth Generalization in Large Language Models for Solving Recursive Logic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02677)
*Zhiyuan He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard transformers struggle with deep recursive tasks due to their inability to maintain stack-like behavior. The paper introduces a looped locate-and-replace pipeline to address this, showing improved performance on out-of-distribution recursion depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the limitation of transformer models in handling deep recursive reasoning tasks, which remains underexplored compared to length generalization.

Method: Developed a looped locate-and-replace pipeline using two specialized models: a locator to identify solvable subexpressions and a replacer to evaluate them while preserving structure. Evaluated in Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic.

Result: Demonstrated that the method effectively reduces performance decay on deeper recursion tasks compared to standard transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully mitigates the architectural limitations of transformers in deep recursive reasoning, offering a promising direction for future work.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

*Hyeongseop Rha,Jeong Hun Yeo,Junil Won,Se Jin Park,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIGR improves multimodal emotion understanding by prioritizing emotion-dominant modalities, reducing reasoning drift and enhancing explanation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reasoning drift in existing methods where models rely on less informative cues or text-generated content instead of multimodal evidence.

Method: Introduces Modality Importance (MI) to identify emotion-dominant modalities, followed by a two-stage framework: modality-aligned fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization.

Result: Substantial improvement in reasoning reliability on DFEW benchmark, reducing emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%.

Conclusion: Starting reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality enhances reliability and consistency in multimodal emotion understanding.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using ontology-aligned knowledge graphs (KGs) to trace how training data influences generative model outputs, addressing transparency and copyright concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of powerful generative models has raised issues like transparency, accountability, and copyright violations, necessitating methods to understand the influence of training data on outputs.

Method: The framework uses multimodal LLMs to extract structured, ontology-aligned triples from images, constructing KGs to compare generated and training images.

Result: Validated via experiments on locally trained models (unlearning) and large-scale models (style-specific tasks), the framework enables copyright analysis and interpretable AI.

Conclusion: The framework enhances transparency in generative AI, supporting human collaboration, creativity, and interpretability.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

*Tianyi Zhang,Xiangyuan Xue,Lingyan Ruan,Shiya Fu,Feng Xia,Simon D'Alfonso,Vassilis Kostakos,Hong Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Menta, an optimized SLM for mental health prediction from social media, outperforming SLMs and LLMs with efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of mental health issues is limited, and while LLMs show promise, their size and computational demands are impractical. SLMs offer a lightweight alternative but are underexplored for social media-based predictions.

Method: Menta is fine-tuned using a LoRA-based framework, cross-dataset strategy, and balanced accuracy-oriented loss across six classification tasks.

Result: Menta improves accuracy by 15.2% over SLMs and matches or exceeds LLM performance while being smaller and deployable on-device with 3GB RAM.

Conclusion: Menta demonstrates scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring potential, with efficient real-world deployment.

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StockMem is a dual-layer memory framework improving stock price prediction by structuring news into events and analyzing their evolution and impact, outperforming existing methods with explainable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock price prediction is complex due to market volatility and noisy news data. Existing LLMs and memory architectures fail to effectively identify key price movement drivers.

Method: StockMem uses an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to build a temporal event knowledge base. It then forms a reflection knowledge base analyzing event-price dynamics.

Result: StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and offers superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices.

Conclusion: StockMem enhances decision transparency in financial forecasting by leveraging event evolution and historical causal experiences for more accurate predictions.

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based Journal Entry Tests (JETs) generate excessive false positives and fail to detect subtle irregularities, prompting exploration of LLMs as anomaly detectors.

Method: Benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and Gemma) on synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, comparing them to JETs and ML baselines.

Result: LLMs consistently surpassed traditional JETs and classical ML methods in performance and provided interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate significant potential for AI-augmented auditing, enhancing financial integrity through collaboration with human auditors.

Abstract: Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping. Benchmarking SoTA LLMs such as LLaMA and Gemma on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, we compare them against JETs and machine learning baselines. Our results show that LLMs consistently outperform traditional rule-based JETs and classical ML baselines, while also providing natural-language explanations that enhance interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends psychometric battery frameworks to dynamical systems, formalizing agents as flows governed by a GVU operator. It introduces the Variance Inequality for stable self-improvement and unifies various architectures under this framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize static agent capability scores to dynamical systems, enabling rigorous analysis and unification of self-improving architectures.

Method: Introduces a GVU operator for agent dynamics, derives the Variance Inequality, and analyzes its stability conditions.

Result: Proves the GVU operator generates a vector field and identifies key conditions for positive self-improvement coefficients.

Conclusion: The framework unifies diverse self-improvement architectures, showing they satisfy the Variance Inequality through various mechanisms.

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for explanations of non-interpretable AI models that are both comprehensible and accurate representations of the model's behavior.

Method: The method involves generating local and global explanations by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions, using a proof-of-concept model.

Result: The framework produces explanations using a clear concept-based vocabulary and demonstrates fidelity by aligning explanation interpretation with generation context.

Conclusion: The framework provides a viable approach for causal concept-based explanations in XAI, balancing understandability and faithfulness.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a prompt-free collaborative agent framework to improve automated paper-to-code generation by verifying and refining outputs automatically, outperforming baselines by 15% and 13% in accuracy and completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for automated paper reproduction lack efficient verification and refinement mechanisms, relying heavily on manual prompts, which limits adaptability and scalability.

Method: The proposed framework uses two agents: a verification agent to check outputs against system prompts and a refinement agent to revise them. It eliminates the need for manual prompt design.

Result: Experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets show improvements of 15% in accuracy and 13% in completeness over baselines. The approach also outperforms Self-Refine.

Conclusion: The prompt-free collaborative agent framework enhances paper-to-code generation quality automatically, proving more robust and consistent than manual refinement methods.

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated radiology reporting tools lack comprehensive quality control, limiting their usefulness for radiologists.

Method: The system uses large language models to autonomously plan and execute actions, including region localization, strategic template selection, and quality assessment.

Result: Radiologist Copilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting.

Conclusion: The tool aids radiologists by providing accurate, complete, and efficient reporting, improving clinical efficiency.

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The study evaluates belief entrenchment in LLMs using the Martingale property and proposes the Martingale Score to measure deviations from rational belief updates. Findings show widespread belief entrenchment across models and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether iterative reasoning in LLMs fosters belief entrenchment and confirmation bias rather than truth-seeking behavior.

Method: Proposes an unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of the Martingale property, indicating irrational belief updates. Applied to open-ended domains like forecasting and academic review.

Result: Belief entrenchment is common across models and setups, with current beliefs predicting future updates. The Martingale Score correlates with ground-truth accuracy.

Conclusion: The Martingale Score is a useful proxy for truth-seeking ability in LLM reasoning, even in domains without ground truth.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

TL;DR: PIBNet is a learning-based method using graph neural networks to efficiently approximate boundary solutions for multiple scattering problems, outperforming existing techniques and generalizing well to more obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The boundary element method (BEM) is computationally intensive for multiple scattering problems. PIBNet aims to reduce this bottleneck by learning the solution trace efficiently.

Method: PIBNet uses a physics-inspired graph-based strategy and a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture to model obstacle interactions and simulate multiple scattering.

Result: PIBNet outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based methods and shows strong generalization to scenarios with increased obstacles.

Conclusion: PIBNet provides an efficient and scalable solution for boundary trace approximation in multiple scattering problems, enhancing BEM's practicality.

Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) provides an efficient numerical framework for solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains, since it reduces the discretization to the domain boundaries, thereby condensing the computational complexity. The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles. github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet

Motivation: To enhance feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating structural features mid-stack rather than at the final layer.

Method: Proposes the SFL Transformer with Contextual Gating to modulate BERT's hidden states using structural cues, applied to UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings.

Result: Achieved Accuracy and Macro F1 of 0.9910, outperforming prior work (Accuracy 0.9894) with low ECE (0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489).

Abstract: This study introduces a significant architectural advancement in feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention mechanism of a pre-trained Transformer. I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an explainable, few-shot AI framework for engineering (AI4E) that integrates physics and expert knowledge to overcome data scarcity and interpretability issues in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. It uses synthetic data augmentation and nested optimization to derive an interpretable constitutive equation with 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The industrial adoption of AI4E is hindered by scarce high-quality data and lack of interpretability in black-box models, especially in safety-critical fields like aerospace. This work aims to address these challenges by leveraging physics and expert knowledge.

Method: The framework combines synthetic data augmentation (noise injection, physical constraints, and inter-parameter preservation) with a nested optimization strategy (symbolic regression and differential evolution) to discover constitutive models.

Result: The derived constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency, offering both quantitative predictions and physical insights into thermal, geometric, and metallurgical coupling mechanisms.

Conclusion: The approach provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI systems in engineering, integrating domain knowledge to enable reliable adoption in high-stakes applications with limited data.

Abstract: The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available.

*Aheer Sravon,Md. Ibrahim,Devdyuti Mazumder,Ridwan Al Aziz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes four pricing algorithms (Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, DDPG) in duopoly markets under varying demand conditions, revealing collusive tendencies and market-specific impacts of demand shocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous pricing algorithms behave in realistic demand scenarios and their impact on competition in digital markets.

Method: Examines four algorithms across three duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and auto-regressive demand-shock regimes, using collusion indices to assess competitive outcomes.

Result: Reinforcement-learning algorithms maintain high prices under stable demand, with DDPG showing strong collusive tendencies. Demand shocks affect markets differently: Logit declines, Hotelling stays stable, Linear profits inflate. Algorithm rankings remain consistent.

Conclusion: Market structure and demand uncertainty significantly shape algorithmic competition, highlighting the need for policy discussions on autonomous pricing behavior.

Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.

*Zhenliang Ni,Xiaowen Ma,Zhenkai Wu,Shuai Xiao,Han Shu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ada-MoGE is an adaptive Gaussian MoE model that adjusts the number of experts based on spectral data, outperforming traditional MoE models on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoE models fail to adapt to shifting frequencies in time series, causing imbalance issues—either missing critical info or introducing noise.

Method: Ada-MoGE uses spectral intensity and frequency response to dynamically set expert numbers, avoiding imbalance. Gaussian band-pass filtering optimizes feature decomposition.

Result: The model achieves top performance on six benchmarks with minimal parameters (0.2M).

Conclusion: Ada-MoGE effectively addresses frequency coverage imbalance in multivariate time series forecasts, offering adaptive and efficient solutions.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasts are widely used, such as industrial, transportation and financial forecasts. However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPWMixer, a Dual-Path architecture for efficient long-term time series forecasting, addressing issues in Transformer-based and linear models by using wavelet decomposition and multi-scale fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with quadratic complexity, data sparsity, or inability to capture non-linear dynamics, while multi-scale frameworks suffer from spectral aliasing and irreversible high-frequency loss.

Method: DPWMixer utilizes a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid for trend disentanglement without data loss, a Dual-Path Trend Mixer combining global linear mapping and patch-based MLP-Mixer, and adaptive multi-scale fusion.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmarks show DPWMixer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DPWMixer offers an efficient and effective solution for LTSF by leveraging wavelet decomposition and dual-path processing.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task in computational intelligence. While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: HTG-GCL is a novel graph contrastive learning framework that uses hierarchical topological granularity to capture diverse topological views and improves performance by decoupling multi-granularity contrasts and weighting mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCL methods struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures and adapt to varying granularities needed for different tasks.

Method: HTG-GCL generates multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes to create diverse topological views and employs a multi-granularity decoupled contrast with granularity-specific weighting based on uncertainty estimation.

Result: Experiments show HTG-GCL outperforms existing methods in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

Conclusion: HTG-GCL effectively addresses the limitations of current GCL approaches by leveraging hierarchical topological granularity and uncertainty-based weighting.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn discriminative semantic invariance by contrasting different views of the same graph that share critical topological patterns. However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

TL;DR: A task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed to address challenges like limited non-IID data, multi-modal fusion, and catastrophic forgetting, improving downstream regression performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle real-world challenges in multi-modal data regression, including non-IID data, effective multi-modal fusion, and model stability.

Method: Integrates multi-modal extraction and contrastive learning, supports flexible low-dimensional representation learning, and uses a multi-constraint framework (MSE loss, mutual information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, inter-model contrastive constraints).

Result: Outperforms classical feature extraction techniques in simulations and real-world data, enhancing downstream regression accuracy.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses key challenges, ensuring task-focused feature extraction and improved regression performance.

Abstract: This study focuses on the feature extraction problem in multi-modal data regression. To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.

TL;DR: GraphTCL is a dual-view contrastive learning framework combining GNNs and topological embeddings for improved graph classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs often miss global topological features crucial for robust graph representation.

Method: GraphTCL integrates structural (GNN) and topological (persistent homology) embeddings via cross-view contrastive loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets like TU and OGB molecular graphs.

Conclusion: Topology-aware contrastive learning advances graph representation methods.

Abstract: Graph classification has gained significant attention due to its applications in chemistry, social networks, and bioinformatics. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLEF introduces clinically-guided contrastive learning for ECG analysis, outperforming existing models with significant improvements in classification and regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECG foundation models lack integration of clinical metadata. CLEF aims to improve diagnostic performance by leveraging clinical risk scores and handling missing metadata.

Method: Uses contrastive learning weighted by clinical risk scores, pretrains single-lead ECG models (CLEF) on MIMIC-IV dataset without per-sample annotations.

Result: CLEF outperforms baselines: 2.6% AUROC improvement in classification, 3.2% MAE reduction in regression. Matches supervised state-of-the-art ECGFounder on lead-I data.

Conclusion: CLEF enables more accurate single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring. Code and models are open-sourced.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in cardiovascular health. Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring. Code and pretrained CLEF models are available at: github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/ecg-foundation-model.

TL;DR: OSAE introduces ordered sparse autoencoders to improve feature consistency in neural networks by enforcing strict ordering and deterministic use of features, resolving permutation non-identifiability and showing empirical improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders lack consistency across seeds and hyperparameters, prompting the need for Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE) to address these issues.

Method: OSAE extends Matryoshka SAEs by enforcing strict ordering of latent features and deterministic feature usage, avoiding sampling-based approximations.

Result: Theoretically, OSAE resolves permutation non-identifiability; empirically, it improves consistency on models like Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M compared to baselines.

Conclusion: OSAE enhances feature consistency in sparse autoencoders, addressing variability issues and offering theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been widely used for interpretability of neural networks, but their learned features often vary across seeds and hyperparameter settings. We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines.

Motivation: The Doughnut framework is popular for sustainability assessment, but lacks practical tools for policy optimization.

Method: Used frugal ML methods (Random Forest Classifier, Q-learning) on a simple macroeconomic Doughnut model to identify sustainable policies and trajectories.

Result: ML methods successfully found policy parameters achieving environmental and social sustainability.

Conclusion: Next steps involve applying these ML methods to more complex ecological macroeconomic models.

Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.

Result: WhAM produces synthetic codas with preserved acoustic features, validated by Fréchet Audio Distance and expert perceptual studies. It also excels in classification tasks.

Conclusion: WhAM successfully generates synthetic sperm whale codas and demonstrates utility beyond generation, offering insights into whale communication.

Abstract: Sperm whales communicate in short sequences of clicks known as codas. We present WhAM (Whale Acoustics Model), the first transformer-based model capable of generating synthetic sperm whale codas from any audio prompt. WhAM is built by finetuning VampNet, a masked acoustic token model pretrained on musical audio, using 10k coda recordings collected over the past two decades. Through iterative masked token prediction, WhAM generates high-fidelity synthetic codas that preserve key acoustic features of the source recordings. We evaluate WhAM's synthetic codas using Fréchet Audio Distance and through perceptual studies with expert marine biologists. On downstream classification tasks including rhythm, social unit, and vowel classification, WhAM's learned representations achieve strong performance, despite being trained for generation rather than classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, especially African languages, limits the effectiveness of LLMs in text generation and chat interfaces. Current methods like automated translation often produce low-quality outputs.

Method: InstructLR integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: automated retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting and human validation.

Result: The framework successfully created three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

Conclusion: InstructLR addresses the dataset quality issue for LRLs, enabling better support for LLMs in low-resource language tasks.

Abstract: Effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs) remain a challenge for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to support. This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

Our goal is to establish the improved efficiency and performance gains achieved by integrating online model selection methods into reinforcement learning training procedures. We examine the theoretical characterizations that are effective for identifying the right configuration in practice, and address three practical criteria from a theoretical perspective: 1) Efficient resource allocation, 2) Adaptation under non-stationary dynamics, and 3) Training stability across different seeds. Our theoretical results are accompanied by empirical evidence from various model selection tasks in reinforcement learning, including neural architecture selection, step-size selection, and self model selection.

TL;DR: Minimal neural networks approximate classic phylogenetic distances, offering scalability and generalization comparable to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and scalability limitations of traditional Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods in phylogenetic inference.

Method: Develop minimal neural network architectures to learn phylogenetic distance functions under various molecular evolutionary models.

Result: Learned distances generalize well and match state-of-the-art inference methods when trained appropriately.

Conclusion: Neural networks provide a scalable, efficient alternative to complex model-based phylogenetic inference.

Abstract: Inferring the phylogenetic relationships among a sample of organisms is a fundamental problem in modern biology. While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.

TL;DR: Examining how fairness improvements reshape Shapley-based feature rankings in healthcare ML models, showing changes in explainability and highlighting the need to jointly assess accuracy, fairness, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of fairness constraints on explainability in healthcare ML models, as clinicians may distrust models with shifted explanations.

Method: Quantifying changes in Shapley-based feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets and evaluating stability across model classes.

Result: Fairness improvements can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes differently across racial subgroups, affecting explainability.

Conclusion: Jointly considering accuracy, fairness, and explainability is crucial for trustworthy ML models in healthcare.

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that membership queries (MQ) in the testable learning model cannot significantly reduce time complexity beyond sample-only learning. It provides reductions linking testable learning with queries (TL-Q) to sample-based refutation, establishing that TL-Q algorithms cannot be super-polynomially more efficient than PAC learners. It also defines a class of statistical MQ algorithms and proves they cannot be made testable under known SQ dimension bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether membership queries can offer computational advantages in the testable learning model compared to sample-only learning, and to explore the limitations of such queries within this framework.

Method: The paper uses reductions from sample-based refutation of boolean concept classes to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). It leverages existing frameworks from learning theory to establish lower bounds and connects TL-Q algorithms to statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms.

Result: The findings demonstrate that membership queries do not provide super-polynomial speedups in testable learning relative to sample-only PAC learning. Additionally, statistical MQ algorithms cannot be made testable under known SQ dimension lower bounds.

Conclusion: Membership queries do not significantly enhance computational efficiency in the testable learning model compared to traditional PAC learning, and certain statistical MQ algorithms are inherently non-testable.

Abstract: Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.
  We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.
  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.

### [201] [Training Dynamics of Learning 3D-Rotational Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02303)
*Max W. Shen,Ewa Nowara,Michael Maser,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how quickly symmetry-agnostic models learn to respect symmetries, focusing on 3D-rotation equivariance in molecular tasks. It introduces a measure of equivariance error and finds models achieve low error quickly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the speed and effectiveness of symmetry-agnostic models in learning to respect symmetries, particularly 3D-rotation equivariance.

Method: Derives a principled measure of equivariance error and empirically investigates 3D-rotation equivariance in molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels).

Result: Models reduce equivariance error to ≤2% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, robust to model and dataset size. Non-equivariant models may outperform equivariant ones per GPU-hour unless efficiency is improved.

Conclusion: Learning 3D-rotational equivariance is easier than the main prediction task, with implications for model design and efficiency.

Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.

### [202] [Unlocking the Power of Boltzmann Machines by Parallelizable Sampler and Efficient Temperature Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02323)
*Kentaro Kubo,Hayato Goto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Boltzmann sampler (LSB) and temperature control method (CEM) enable efficient learning for BMs, surpassing RBMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Boltzmann sampling methods like MCMC are slow and hard to parallelize, limiting BM applications.

Method: Proposed Langevin SB (LSB) for parallelized sampling and conditional expectation matching (CEM) for inverse temperature control.

Result: Combining LSB and CEM improves BM learning efficiency and expressive power, termed sampler-adaptive learning (SAL).

Conclusion: SAL advances energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

Abstract: Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAM-OL enhances online learning with retrieval-augmented memory, improving accuracy and stability in non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding in using retrieval-augmented models for streaming supervised learning with concept drift.

Method: Proposes RAM-OL, extending SGD with a buffer of past examples and retrieving nearest neighbours for joint updates. Includes naive and gated replay variants.

Result: Improves prequential accuracy by up to 7% on drifting streams and reduces variance; matches baseline on noisy streams.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented memory is practical and robust for online learning under concept drift.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

TL;DR: FOVA introduces a vote-based framework for offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to handle mixed-quality data, leveraging a vote mechanism and AWR for improved performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline FRL methods struggle with mixed-quality data from diverse local policies, prompting the need for a solution like FOVA.

Method: FOVA uses a vote mechanism to identify high-return actions and AWR for consistent local and global training objectives.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms policy improvement, and experiments show FOVA outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: FOVA effectively addresses mixed-quality data challenges in offline FRL, offering superior performance and stability.

Abstract: Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a gradient-based method for optimizing policy performance in POMDPs with minimal requirements and theoretical guarantees.

Method: Introduces GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm estimating gradients of average reward using a single sample path and one free parameter for bias-variance trade-off.

Result: GPOMDP converges and its gradient estimates can be used in conjugate-gradient procedures to find local optima of average reward.

Conclusion: GPOMDP is efficient and effective for gradient-based optimization in POMDPs, requiring minimal information and parameters.

Abstract: This paper discusses theoretical and experimental aspects of gradient-based approaches to the direct optimization of policy performance in controlled POMDPs. We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $β\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of risk-sensitive RL in continuous-time environments with nonlinear reward functionals, aiming for practical solutions like dynamic portfolio selection.

Method: Proves Markovian policies for OCE functionals and introduces CT-RS-q, a martingale-based q-learning algorithm, tested in simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESACT is an end-to-end sparse accelerator for Transformers, using SPLS to predict sparsity with local similarity, reducing computation by 52.03% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face high computational costs hindering hardware deployment. Existing accelerators often exploit only intra-row sparsity or rely on costly global similarity estimation.

Method: Proposes ESACT with Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism, using HLog quantization for efficient sparsity prediction across all transformer components.

Result: SPLS reduces computation by 52.03% with <1% accuracy loss. ESACT achieves 3.29 TOPS/W energy efficiency and outperforms SpAtten and Sanger.

Conclusion: ESACT effectively addresses Transformer efficiency challenges by leveraging local similarity for end-to-end sparse acceleration.

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

*Oshada Jayasinghe,Farhana Choudhury,Egemen Tanin,Shanika Karunasekera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic on-street parking space configuration solution using a two-layer multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to reduce traffic congestion caused by parking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic congestion worsens due to on-street parking limiting road width. The study leverages vehicle-to-infrastructure tech to optimize parking spaces dynamically.

Method: A data-driven optimization approach with a two-layer multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Lane and block level agents manage parking configurations using Deep Q-learning with LSTM and graph attention networks.

Result: Experiments in SUMO with synthetic and Melbourne data show up to 47% reduction in average travel time loss, with minimal extra walking distance for parking.

Conclusion: The framework effectively minimizes traffic congestion from on-street parking while balancing parking availability.

Abstract: With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.

### [210] [Data Curation Through the Lens of Spectral Dynamics: Static Limits, Dynamic Acceleration, and Practical Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02409)
*Yizhou Zhang,Lun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines data curation methods in large-scale neural models, distinguishing between static pruning and dynamic curation. Static pruning offers limited improvements, while ideal dynamic curation can accelerate learning, though practical implementations are imperfect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how different data-centric strategies impact training efficiency and model performance, particularly focusing on synthetic data and pruning methods, which often fail to yield meaningful improvements.

Method: The authors formalize data curation as sampling distribution reweighting and analyze its effect on the data-induced operator's eigenstructure. They compare static pruning and time-dependent curation, using theoretical frameworks to map their impacts.

Result: Static pruning induces bounded operators, limiting its benefits to finite regions without altering asymptotic scaling. In contrast, ideal dynamic curation (tracking spectral residuals) can accelerate learning, though practical systems fall short of this ideal.

Conclusion: Practical data curation systems should strive to approximate dynamic curation methods for meaningful improvements, as static pruning alone is insufficient for significant gains.

Abstract: Large-scale neural models are increasingly trained with data pruning, synthetic data generation, cross-model distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and difficulty-based sampling. While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.
  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.

TL;DR: DVDF method selects high-quality source domain samples with both dynamics and value alignment for cross-domain offline RL, outperforming baselines in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current cross-domain RL methods by emphasizing both dynamics and value alignment for better policy learning.

Method: Proposes DVDF to filter source domain samples based on dynamics and value alignment, tested across various tasks and datasets.

Result: DVDF consistently outperforms prior baselines, especially in extremely low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Dynamics and value alignment are critical for effective cross-domain offline RL, with DVDF providing superior performance.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

TL;DR: LLM agents show sensitivity to context length, type, and placement, with unexpected shifts in task performance and refusal rates, revealing potential safety issues in long-context setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unexplored agentic setup capabilities and safety perspectives of LLMs in long-context scenarios.

Method: Evaluated LLM agents on long-context prompts, focusing on task performance and refusal rates for harmful requests.

Result: Performance degraded severely (over 50%) at 100K tokens for models with 1M-2M token windows. Refusal rates shifted unpredictably (e.g., GPT-4.1-nano increased from ~5% to ~40%, while Grok 4 Fast decreased from ~80% to ~10%).

Conclusion: LLM agents exhibit divergence in capability and safety compared to prior LLM evaluations, highlighting potential risks and questioning current safety evaluation metrics for long tasks.

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TabGRU, a hybrid deep learning model combining Transformer and BiGRU, for high-resolution urban rainfall monitoring using Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs). It outperforms traditional methods and deep learning baselines, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating urbanization and extreme weather events necessitate accurate rainfall monitoring. Traditional physics-based models struggle with real-world complexities in CML data, prompting the need for advanced solutions.

Method: Proposes TabGRU, a hybrid architecture integrating Transformer and BiGRU, enhanced by learnable positional embedding and attention pooling, to capture long-term dependencies and local sequential features in CML data.

Result: Validated on Gothenburg dataset, TabGRU achieved R2 scores of 0.91 (Torp) and 0.96 (Barl), outperforming deep learning baselines and mitigating overestimation issues in physics-based models during peak rainfall.

Conclusion: TabGRU effectively overcomes traditional method limitations, offering a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring.

Abstract: In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DROCO, a dual-robust cross-domain offline RL algorithm addressing both train-time and test-time robustness against dynamics shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain offline RL focuses on train-time robustness but neglects test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations, especially with limited target domain data.

Method: Proposes a robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator for test-time robustness, supplemented by dynamic value penalty and Huber loss to mitigate value estimation errors.

Result: DROCO outperforms baselines across various dynamics shift scenarios, showing enhanced robustness.

Conclusion: DROCO effectively addresses dual robustness challenges in cross-domain offline RL, improving performance under dynamics perturbations.

Abstract: Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.

*Zihao Zhao,Kai-Chia Mo,Shing-Hei Ho,Brandon Amos,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm computes gradients for differentiable optimization layers using only first-order information, avoiding Hessian evaluations and ensuring efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for computing gradients in differentiable optimization layers are resource-intensive due to Hessian evaluations.

Method: The paper introduces an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle, rewriting differentiable optimization as bilevel optimization and leveraging bilevel methods.

Result: The algorithm provides finite-time guarantees and computes gradients efficiently, matching the best-known complexity rates for constrained bilevel optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more efficient alternative to existing techniques, with an open-source library available for adaptation.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization layers enable learning systems to make decisions by solving embedded optimization problems. However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer.

### [217] [Do Large Language Models Walk Their Talk? Measuring the Gap Between Implicit Associations, Self-Report, and Behavioral Altruism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01568)
*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study tests 24 LLMs for altruism using IAT, behavioral tasks, and self-reports. Finds strong implicit altruism bias, overestimation of altruistic behavior ('virtue signaling gap'), and recommends Calibration Gap as an alignment metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs exhibit altruistic tendencies and whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior, drawing from human social psychology methods.

Method: Multi-method approach: (1) Implicit Association Test (IAT) for implicit altruism bias, (2) forced binary choice task measuring altruistic behavior, (3) self-assessment scale for explicit altruism beliefs.

Result: Key findings: (1) Strong implicit pro-altruism bias in all models. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance but with variation. (3) Implicit associations don't predict behavior. (4) Models overestimate their altruism ('virtue signaling gap').

Conclusion: Recommends Calibration Gap as a standardized alignment metric. Few models (12.5%) achieve high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

*Krishnendu S. Tharakan,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DMTFL, a decentralized federated learning method for personalized VR content caching at base stations, addressing biases and heterogeneity in traditional FL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless VR requires low latency and high quality, but traditional FL methods fail to handle user and BS heterogeneity, leading to biased models.

Method: Proposes DMTFL, which learns personalized caching models per BS and optimizes them for generalizability with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Simulations using real VR head-tracking data show DMTFL outperforms baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: DMTFL effectively addresses heterogeneity in VR caching, offering improved performance and theoretical robustness.

Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

*Vishnu Sarukkai,Asanshay Gupta,James Hong,Michaël Gharbi,Kayvon Fatahalian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes in-context distillation to reduce LLM agent costs without fine-tuning or prompt engineering, achieving 2.5x lower costs on ALFWorld and 2x on AppWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses high inference costs of LLM agents while avoiding development friction like fine-tuning or manual prompt engineering.

Method: Introduces in-context distillation, using teacher demonstrations to guide student models dynamically, combined with self-consistency cascades for reliability.

Result: Matches teacher-level accuracy at 2.5x lower cost on ALFWorld and 2x cost reduction on AppWorld.

Conclusion: Enables cost-effective advanced agentic systems without sacrificing performance or productivity.

Abstract: The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.

### [221] [Tensor Network Based Feature Learning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02547)
*Albert Saiapin,Kim Batselier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Feature Learning (FL) model to efficiently learn hyperparameters for tensor-product features in kernel-based algorithms, using Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) and ALS optimization, outperforming standard cross-validation in speed and maintaining prediction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard cross-validation approach for identifying optimal feature hyperparameters in kernel-based algorithms is inefficient. The FL model aims to address this by integrating hyperparameter learning into the model training process.

Method: The FL model reparameterizes tensor-product features using CPD and employs ALS optimization to simultaneously learn hyperparameters and model parameters.

Result: Experiments show the FL model trains 3-5 times faster than cross-validation while achieving comparable prediction quality on real datasets of varying dimensionality and scale.

Conclusion: The FL model effectively combines hyperparameter learning with model training, offering a faster and equally accurate alternative to cross-validation for kernel-based algorithms.

Abstract: Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that even highly optimized kernels like HGEMM can be further improved using LLM-guided RL automation.

Method: CUDA-L2 uses RL with CUDA execution speed as reward to optimize HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations.

Result: CUDA-L2 outperforms torch.matmul (+22%), cuBLAS (+19.2%), cuBLASLt-heuristic (+16.8%), and cuBLASLt-AutoTuning (+11.4%) in offline mode; speedups increase further in server mode.

Conclusion: LLM-guided RL can effectively optimize performance-critical kernels by exploring large configuration spaces, surpassing human-designed solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it torch.matmul}, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GoRL decouples optimization from generation to combine stable learning with expressive multimodal action distributions, outperforming Gaussian and generative-policy baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the tension between stable optimization and expressive multimodal action distributions in RL policies.

Method: Introduces GoRL, optimizing a tractable latent policy with a conditional generative decoder, using a two-timescale update schedule.

Result: GoRL outperforms Gaussian and generative-policy baselines, achieving a normalized return above 870 on HopperStand.

Conclusion: Separating optimization from generation yields stable, highly expressive policies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

*Wenhao Sha,Tienchong Chang*

TL;DR: HeatTransFormer is a physics-guided Transformer that effectively models heat transfer in semiconductor devices, overcoming PINNs' instability and numerical solvers' inefficiency with steep gradients at material interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like numerical solvers and PINNs struggle with steep interfacial temperature gradients in semiconductor heat transfer, leading to inefficiency or instability.

Method: HeatTransFormer integrates spatiotemporal sampling, Laplace-based activation, and mask-free attention to resolve gradients and maintain physical consistency.

Result: The model successfully resolves temperature gradients and identifies three unknown thermal properties using external measurements.

Conclusion: Physics-guided Transformers offer a unified solution for forward and inverse modeling in thermal systems with steep gradients.

Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve performance in target tasks by transferring knowledge from related source problems efficiently, especially for resource-constrained devices.

Method: Uses tensor kernel machines with low-rank tensor networks for compact non-linear learning, adapting models via regularization without extra parameters.

Result: Adapt-TKM achieves better performance in seizure detection with 100x fewer parameters than adaptive SVM, enabling faster inference.

Conclusion: Adapt-TKM is effective for efficient transfer learning, making it suitable for wearable devices.

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN agents suffer from perception, reasoning, and planning errors, limiting their navigation performance. This work aims to mitigate these issues.

Method: Proposes a dual-view Visual Prompt technique for perception improvement and SRGPO for step-level reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance planning.

Result: GPT-4.1 achieves an 86.7% navigation success rate with VP; Qwen2.5-VL-3B reaches 72.3% with SRGPO, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: SeeNav-Agent significantly improves VLN performance through innovative VP and SRGPO methods, demonstrating better stability and generalization.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: OptPO is a framework that dynamically allocates inference budgets for test-time policy optimization in LLMs, reducing computational redundancy while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting for reward estimation, which is computationally inefficient. OptPO aims to optimize this process.

Method: OptPO uses Bayesian sequential probability ratio tests to dynamically halt sampling when consensus confidence is high, leveraging retained rollouts for policy updates.

Result: OptPO reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy across reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: OptPO provides a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation by unifying optimal stopping with test-time learning.

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

TL;DR: F2D2 is a framework that reduces the computational cost of likelihood evaluation and sampling in flow-based generative models by two orders of magnitude, using joint distillation of sampling trajectories and divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion and flow-based models require hundreds to thousands of computations for likelihood evaluation, creating a bottleneck. Distillation methods accelerate sampling but sacrifice likelihood tractability.

Method: F2D2 jointly distills sampling trajectories and divergence predictions using a shared velocity field, requiring only an additional divergence prediction head.

Result: F2D2 achieves accurate log-likelihood evaluations with few steps while maintaining sample quality, outperforming traditional models.

Conclusion: F2D2 solves a computational bottleneck in flow-based models, enabling efficient likelihood evaluation and high-quality sampling with minimal steps.

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

Abstract: Multi-view learning integrates diverse representations of the same instances to improve performance. Most existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods use fusion techniques without enforcing an explicit collaboration type across views or co-regularization which limits global collaboration. We propose AW-LSSVM, an adaptive weighted LS-SVM that promotes complementary learning by an iterative global coupling to make each view focus on hard samples of others from previous iterations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative distillation-based continual unlearning framework to address the challenges of sequential data deletion requests in visual generative models, ensuring stable and targeted unlearning without degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of visual generative models conflicts with privacy regulations like GDPR's 'Right to be Forgotten,' necessitating efficient unlearning methods that handle sequential deletion requests without retraining.

Method: A novel generative distillation-based continual unlearning framework is proposed, treating each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student process to maintain model integrity.

Result: Experiments show the method effectively unlearns targeted concepts without harming retained concepts or overall generative quality, outperforming baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests while maintaining generative model performance.

Abstract: The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.

*Haozhuo Zheng,Cheng Wang,Yang Liu*

TL;DR: GVT introduces a Graph VQ-Transformer, combining Graph VQ-VAE with autoregressive Transformer for efficient, high-accuracy molecular generation, outperforming diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming computational intensity in diffusion models and error propagation in autoregressive models for molecule generation.

Method: Two-stage framework: Graph VQ-VAE compresses graphs into discrete latents; Transformer models these sequences.

Result: SOTA performance on benchmarks (ZINC250k, MOSES, GuacaMol), surpassing diffusion models on FCD and KL Divergence.

Conclusion: GVT sets a new baseline for molecular generation, enabling synergies with LLMs and future discrete latent-space research.

Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an entropy-constrained conformal correction method to improve CP efficiency while balancing prediction entropy, achieving significant gains in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of conformal prediction (CP) by addressing the trade-off between CP efficiency and prediction entropy.

Method: Proposes an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, optimizing for efficiency and entropy balance using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss.

Result: Demonstrates up to 34.4% efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art CP methods under entropy constraints.

Conclusion: The entropy-constrained approach effectively balances efficiency and entropy, offering practical enhancements for CP in machine learning.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a comprehensive framework to produce statistically rigorous uncertainty sets for black-box machine learning models. To further improve the efficiency of CP, conformal correction is proposed to fine-tune or wrap the base model with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss. In this work, we empirically and theoretically identify a trade-off between the CP efficiency and the entropy of model prediction. We then propose an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, exploring a better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. Extensive experimental results on both computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, it can significantly improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art CP methods by up to 34.4%, given an entropy threshold.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes FGC-Comp, a lightweight attribute completion module to improve graph-based anomaly detection under missing or obscured node attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based anomaly detection models struggle with missing or adversarially obscured node attributes, affecting aggregation stability and prediction reliability.

Method: FGC-Comp partitions neighbors into label-based groups, applies group-specific transforms, uses a node-conditioned gate for unknowns, and fuses messages with residual connections, trained end-to-end.

Result: Validated on real-world fraud datasets, FGC-Comp enhances aggregation stability and prediction reliability with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: FGC-Comp effectively addresses attribute incompleteness in graph-based anomaly detection, improving performance without significant computational cost.

Abstract: Graph-based Anomaly Detection models have gained widespread adoption in recent years, identifying suspicious nodes by aggregating neighborhood information. However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGNNs introduce credal learning to GNNs for uncertainty quantification, outperforming existing methods under distributional shift, especially on heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods for GNNs rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles, which may not fully address epistemic uncertainty under out-of-distribution conditions.

Method: CGNNs leverage credal learning by outputting set-valued predictions (credal sets) and incorporate unique aspects of GNN message passing.

Result: CGNNs provide more reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift, particularly on heterophilic graphs.

Conclusion: CGNNs effectively extend credal learning to GNNs, highlighting the importance of graph homophily assumptions in uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying reliable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where existing approaches primarily rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles. In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs.

*Waleed El-Geresy,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial wireless jamming to regularize an autoencoder's latent space to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution, achieving results comparable to standard variational autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve latent space regularization by leveraging adversarial jamming, inspired by theoretical results involving encoder-decoder-jammer interactions.

Method: A minimax game involving an encoder, decoder, and adversarial jammer is used to match the latent posterior to a diagonal Gaussian distribution.

Result: The proposed technique achieves distribution matching performance similar to variational autoencoders and Wasserstein autoencoders.

Conclusion: Adversarial jamming effectively regularizes latent space distributions and can be generalized to other latent distributions.

Abstract: We propose the use of adversarial wireless jamming to regularise the latent space of an autoencoder to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiMMIA, a modular framework for Multimodal Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), addressing distribution shifts in datasets and extending baseline pipelines for detection in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting data contamination in LLMs perform poorly on MLLMs due to instability from multimodal adaptations and distribution shifts. The work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The approach involves identifying dataset distribution shifts, extending baseline pipelines, and generalizing perturbation-based MIA methods for MLLMs. A neural network analyzes perturbed inputs to differentiate members from non-members.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show the effectiveness of the perturbation-based MIA method in multimodal domains, as demonstrated across various fine-tuned MLLMs.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses MIA challenges in MLLMs with FiMMIA, providing a robust framework for detecting membership inference vulnerabilities in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific data point was included in the training set of a target model. Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members. Comprehensive evaluations on various fine-tuned multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of our perturbation-based membership inference attacks in multimodal domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the memorization-generalization behavior of flow-based diffusion models, revealing a two-stage training process: early generalization across data modes and later memorization of fine details. It provides insights for practical techniques and future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the memorization-generalization dynamics of flow-based diffusion models, which are widely used for generative tasks but lack comprehensive analysis.

Method: The study revisits the flow matching (FM) objective, analyzing its marginal velocity field with a closed-form expression to compute the oracle FM target. This reveals a two-stage training process.

Result: The analysis shows an early stage generalizing across data modes and a later stage focusing on memorizing fine details, explaining the effectiveness of techniques like timestep-shifted schedules.

Conclusion: The findings deepen understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offer principles for improving future architectures and algorithms.

Abstract: Flow-based diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for training generative models across images and videos. However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.

TL;DR: The paper explores input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), highlighting REVIN as the most efficient approach for reducing zero-shot MASE and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization is critical for TSFMs due to scale variation and non-stationarity in time-series data, yet it remains understudied.

Method: Systematic evaluation of four diverse TSFMs, comparing REVIN against other normalization methods.

Result: REVIN reduces zero-shot MASE by 89% vs. baseline and 44% vs. others, achieving competitive in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE).

Conclusion: REVIN offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, though its effectiveness depends on architectural choices and optimization objectives.

Abstract: We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphMatch combines pretrained language models and graph neural networks for effective recommendations in dynamic, text-rich marketplaces, outperforming standalone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of recommending matches in dynamic, text-rich two-sided marketplaces where content and interaction graphs evolve, requiring robust solutions.

Method: GraphMatch integrates pretrained language models with graph neural networks, using adversarial negative sampling and point-in-time subgraph training to capture evolving text semantics and graph structure.

Result: Extensive evaluation on Upwork data shows GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines in matching tasks while maintaining runtime efficiency.

Conclusion: Unifying language and graph representations creates an effective solution for text-rich, dynamic recommendations, bridging the gap between pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs.

Abstract: Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive decentralized federated learning (aDFL) method that adjusts client learning rates to mitigate disruptions from abnormal clients without needing prior knowledge or strict conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing decentralized federated learning (DFL) methods, which rely on large numbers of normal clients or prior knowledge, to enhance robustness against noisy or poisoned data.

Method: Develops aDFL, which adaptively adjusts learning rates—assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients—to reduce the impact of abnormal clients.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms aDFL's oracle property, and numerical experiments show its superior performance in mitigating disruptions.

Conclusion: aDFL effectively enhances DFL robustness by adaptively managing client contributions without requiring prior knowledge or strict neighbor conditions.

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the presence of abnormal clients, often caused by noisy or poisoned data, can significantly disrupt the learning process and degrade the overall robustness of the model. Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method.

TL;DR: Multi-fidelity neural emulators integrate limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity data to tackle intractable outer loop tasks and data-driven architectures, improving accuracy despite model complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outer loop tasks and data-driven models often become intractable due to computational costs or large dataset requirements, prompting the need for efficient multi-fidelity solutions.

Method: Multi-fidelity neural emulators (like MLPs, SIRENs, and KANs) are studied across various scenarios—dimensionality, oscillatory functions, discontinuities, model parametrization, and corrupted low-fidelity sources—with diverse architectural and hyperparameter configurations.

Result: The study evaluates performance gains by comparing multi-fidelity emulators with single-fidelity counterparts across different conditions, quantifying the benefits of integrating multiple data sources.

Conclusion: Multi-fidelity neural emulators effectively enhance predictive accuracy and efficiency, leveraging low-fidelity data to correct high-fidelity predictions, demonstrating significant performance improvements over single-fidelity approaches.

Abstract: Outer loop tasks such as optimization, uncertainty quantification or inference can easily become intractable when the underlying high-fidelity model is computationally expensive. Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.

TL;DR: Fairy2i is a framework that converts pre-trained real-valued LLMs into complex-valued layers, enabling ultra-low-bit quantization without retraining, achieving near full-precision performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage complex-valued LLMs' efficiency without discarding pre-trained real-valued models, bridging the gap between low-bit quantization and practical utility.

Method: Transformers are converted into complex domain using mathematical equivalence, phase-aware quantization, and recursive residual quantization for error minimization.

Result: Fairy2i restores LLaMA-2 7B performance at 2-bit precision, surpassing real-valued binary/ternary methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient inference on commodity hardware by combining complex arithmetic's benefits with pre-trained models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

TL;DR: A framework for hypothesis testing in generalized Thurstone models is developed, focusing on separation distance, critical thresholds, and error bounds, validated with synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in hypothesis testing for generalized Thurstone models, which prior work mainly focused on parameter estimation.

Method: Introduces a separation distance metric, derives thresholds based on graph topology, proposes a hypothesis test, and uses reverse martingale techniques for error bounds.

Result: For complete graphs, the threshold scales as Θ((nk)^{-1/2}). Confidence intervals and minimax lower bounds are established.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tests Thurstone models, with theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a hypothesis testing framework to determine whether pairwise comparison data is generated by an underlying \emph{generalized Thurstone model} $\mathcal{T}_F$ for a given choice function $F$. While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Ziniu Zhang,Minxuan Duan,Haris N. Koutsopoulos,Hongyang R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multimodal data (road network and satellite images) to analyze traffic accidents, showing improved prediction accuracy and identifying key factors like weather and road type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on road network features alone, missing environmental and physical context. This study aims to integrate multimodal data for better accident prediction and causal analysis.

Method: A large multimodal dataset was created with accident records, satellite images, and road network features. Multimodal learning methods were evaluated, combining visual and network embeddings.

Result: Integration of modalities improved prediction accuracy (90.1% AUROC, +3.7% over graph-only models). Causality analysis identified precipitation, road type, and seasonal patterns as significant contributors.

Conclusion: Combining satellite imagery with road network data enhances accident prediction. Environmental and road features are critical for accurate analysis.

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

TL;DR: Speeding up Gaussian process computation for autocorrelated data by modifying existing approximations, using data blocking to avoid temporal overfitting, achieving faster computation without losing prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Gaussian process approximations assume independent data, but autocorrelated data causes temporal overfitting. Existing methods need adaptation to handle such data effectively.

Method: Modify existing fast Gaussian process approximations by segmenting autocorrelated data into blocks to de-correlate them.

Result: Numerical experiments show the proposed methods significantly speed up computation without degrading prediction performance on autocorrelated data.

Conclusion: Blocking and adapting existing approximations effectively address the challenges of autocorrelated data in Gaussian process regression, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of how to speed up computation for Gaussian process models trained on autocorrelated data. The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.

*Jennifer Zvonek,Andrew Gillette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PruningAMR is an algorithm that adaptively refines mesh resolution based on geometric features in implicit neural representations (INRs), achieving memory savings without needing training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs are memory-efficient but often require discretization for visualization. PruningAMR addresses this by extracting geometric features to guide adaptive mesh refinement.

Method: Uses interpolative decomposition pruning on INR weight matrices to identify features, then refines mesh resolution accordingly.

Result: Produces variable-resolution visualizations with significant memory savings from a pre-trained INR.

Conclusion: PruningAMR efficiently bridges INR representation and practical visualization needs, reducing memory usage while preserving detail.

Abstract: An implicit neural representation (INR) is a neural network that approximates a spatiotemporal function. Many memory-intensive visualization tasks, including modern 4D CT scanning methods, represent data natively as INRs. While INRs are prized for being more memory-efficient than traditional data stored on a lattice, many visualization tasks still require discretization to a regular grid. We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function. Starting from a pre-trained INR--without access to its training data--we produce a variable resolution visualization with substantial memory savings.

Conclusion: ProteinPNet demonstrates the potential of prototype-based learning to reveal interpretable spatial biomarkers, aiding mechanistic discovery in spatial omics.

Abstract: Understanding the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to advance precision oncology. We present ProteinPNet, a novel framework based on prototypical part networks that discovers TME motifs from spatial proteomics data. Unlike traditional post-hoc explanability models, ProteinPNet directly learns discriminative, interpretable, faithful spatial prototypes through supervised training. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes. Through graphical and morphological analyses, we show that these prototypes capture interpretable features pointing to differences in immune infiltration and tissue modularity. Our results highlight the potential of prototype-based learning to reveal interpretable spatial biomarkers within the TME, with implications for mechanistic discovery in spatial omics.

*Yepeng Ding,Ahmed Twabi,Junwei Yu,Lingfeng Zhang,Tohru Kondo,Hiroyuki Sato*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Proposes a Decentralized Multi-Agent System (DMAS) using blockchain to address trust, scalability, and censorship issues in MAS.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized MAS architectures suffer from single points of failure, censorship vulnerability, scalability limitations, and trust issues.

Method: Introduces DMAS with blockchain-based runtime and a trust-aware communication protocol using cryptographic primitives and on-chain operations.

Result: Validates DMAS as scalable and efficient, with security properties like verifiable interaction cycles and communication integrity.

Conclusion: DMAS offers a robust solution for trustworthy and censorship-resistant multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly accelerating the development of autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS), paving the way for the Internet of Agents. However, traditional centralized MAS architectures present significant challenges, including single points of failure, vulnerability to censorship, inherent scalability limitations, and critical trust issues. We propose a novel Decentralized Multi-Agent System (DMAS) architecture designed to overcome these fundamental problems by enabling trust-aware, scalable, and censorship-resistant interactions among autonomous agents. Our DMAS features a decentralized agent runtime underpinned by a blockchain-based architecture. We formalize a trust-aware communication protocol that leverages cryptographic primitives and on-chain operations to provide security properties: verifiable interaction cycles, communication integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and conditional confidentiality, which we further substantiate through a comprehensive security analysis. Our performance analysis validates the DMAS as a scalable and efficient solution for building trustworthy multi-agent systems.

### [249] [EZYer: A simulacrum of high school with generative agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02561)
*Jinming Yang,Zimu Ji,Weiqi Luo,Gaoxi Wang,Bin Ma,Yueling Deng*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces EZYer, a generative agent addressing gaps in online education tools by offering automated courseware generation, interactive note-taking, and strict content quality controls. Evaluations confirm its high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online education tools lack comprehensive services, performance, and interactivity, especially in courseware generation and interactive learning. EZYer aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: EZYer comprises a Teacher Module (automated courseware generation), Student Module (collaborative note-taking), and Controller (quality assurance systems). It was evaluated using five-dimensional metrics scored by large language models.

Result: Evaluations of 100 generated outputs showed high quality in content accuracy, knowledge coverage, usability, formatting, and visual appeal, indicating strong application potential.

Conclusion: EZYer effectively addresses existing educational tool limitations and demonstrates excellent performance, making it promising for future use in online education.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the online education and large language model, the existing educational tools still suffer from incomplete service, insufficient performance and weak interactivity in terms of courseware generation, interactive notes and quality assurance of content. In particular, the proposed generative agent EZYer : 1) Teacher Module: Integrating the Text Corpus retrieval and in-depth generation technologies, it automatically generates structured teaching materials and LaTeX Beamer courseware in line with the high school mathematics syllabus and supports user-defined image insertion. 2) Student Module: Throughout the collaborative interaction of the four roles of Teacher, Assistant, Top Student and Struggling Student, Note Taker summarizes and generates academic notes to enhance the depth and interest of learning. 3) Controller: set up keyword filtering system, content scoring system, role co-validation system, and dynamic content correction system. This ensure academic strictness and pedagogical propriety of EZYer inputs and outputs. In order to evaluate EZYer, this paper designs five-dimensional evaluation indexes of content accuracy, knowledge coverage, usability, formatting correctness and visual design and appeal, and scores 100 Beamer and Notes generated by EZYer by five large language models, separately, and the results show that the quality of EZYer-generated content is excellent and has a good application prospect.

### [250] [Beyond Single-Agent Safety: A Taxonomy of Risks in LLM-to-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02682)
*Piercosma Bisconti,Marcello Galisai,Federico Pierucci,Marcantonio Bracale,Matteo Prandi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores why current safety mechanisms fail in multi-model LLM ecosystems and proposes a shift to system-level safety with the ESRH framework and InstitutionalAI design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety practices are inadequate for LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, as they focus on single-agent containment and ignore risks from interaction dynamics.

Method: The paper introduces the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) framework to analyze collective risk and proposes InstitutionalAI for adaptive oversight in multi-agent systems.

Result: It provides a theoretical analysis of collective risk, a taxonomy of failure modes, and a design for system-level governance.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift from model-level to system-level safety is necessary to manage risks in evolving LLM ecosystems.

Abstract: This paper examines why safety mechanisms designed for human-model interaction do not scale to environments where large language models (LLMs) interact with each other. Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems.
